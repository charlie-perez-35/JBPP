But as political amateurs we do not know our own strengths and weaknesses, and we are not sure just what steps to take to change our own community.

I am also writing this same letter to Senator Leroy Johnson.</p><p>Compulsory Unionism is one of the greatest drawbacks that the negro has to face.</p><p>Over the past ten years or more I have worked a crew of Union Negro Brickmasons and all during these years I have taken the most promising of my negro labor, put them on the line and made first class brickmasons of them.  during their four years of apprecticeship with me, they were gradually increased in pay as the Union Scale provided until they Became Jouneymen.  This week the fourth of these men who was ready for his card, was working on the job when a business agent from No. 8 Union came on the job, the first we have ever had, ordered the man off the line unless he immediately paid $50.00 and the balance of his $150.00 initiation fee at $3.00 per working day.  He then advised me and this was news, that <u>no onea</u> could apprentice unless he took a <u>six weeks</u> schooling in the apprentice work shop.  I gave him the $150.00 so this man could get his card but now I am stopped because the average man is married, the next one I would have put on the line has six children, and could not afford to take one week, let alone six, at the pittance I am sure they are paid.</p><p>Some few years ago when the civil rights area was being explored, the Carpenters Union changed the bye laws so as to require that <u>no one</u> may apprentice as a carpenter unless he had a High School Educatioin and diploma.  This automatically eliminated the average southern negro, especially one who works for us as a laborer and has the natural ability to become a carpenter.</p><p>There must be some way to break these two restrictions and they should be broken.</p><p>QUALITY WILL BE EVIDENT LONG AFTER THE COST HAS BEEN FORGOTTEN</p>                       <p>[letter head]<br/>MAYNARD JOHNSTON              PHONE 255-4211<br/>MAYNARD JOHNSTON &amp; CO.<br/>MAILING ADDRESS                                               Construction<br/>P.

I any case, I expressed an interest, on the part of the Women for Peace here, to have a representative speaker from the NCNP address the people of our congressional district who are interested in running a peace candidate in 1968. (This is a part of of a group of lectures we are sponsoring to present the possibilities of this move to the community.)</p><p>Since we are not able to completely cover the transportation costs for a speaker, I took the liberty of contacting the Dayton Peace Committee, and received <sup>an</sup> enthusiastic reply confirming their interest in having this speaker address their group as well. (Dayton, you may know, is a 40-minute drive from Yellow Springs.) Since April 11 is one of their meeting dates, and is the best week for us, we wonder if it might be possible to arrange a Yellow Springs meeting April 10 or 12, according to your preference, and the Dayton meeting April 11.</p><p>We are anxious to hear from you as soon as possible.</p><p>Sincerely,<br/>(handwritten signature)</p><p>Mrs. Joseph D'Oronzio<br/>Women for Peace</p><p>P.S.

Julian Bond<br/>House of Representatives<br/>Georgia Stage Legislature<br/>Atlanta, Georgia</p><p>Dear Julian:</p><p>I am enclosing a copy of a letter I'm sending to the ""Post"" regarding the story on you in the May 6 issue. Since I never got anything published except slanted sport stories and space using poems in the GS News or Ernestine Robinson edited phrases in the yearbook, I doubt if this will make in into the ""Letters"" section of the magazine, but I wanted you to know I had written it nevertheless.</p><p>Jinny (Coates) and I ahve spoken of you frequently. I can remember when the ""Post"" did the SNCC articlae and had a picture of you with a small paragraph mentioning you in it, I wrote the editors asking how I could write to you.  They answered, but I never got the letter written.</p><p>I talked with Mrs Coates last night - - had called to see if Jinny was going to our tenth reunion (doesn't seem  possible we've gotten so old)! I also told her to buy the magazine to read the article, as i'm sure you know they were always very fond of you. Mrs. Coates mentioned that they were disappointed in you, more for your affiliation with SNCC and Carmichael than for any statements attributed to you, but we felt you were a victim if circumstances and the damn news media that  blow things out of proportion on matters of prejudice and civil rights. From Mr. Frady's description of you, you haven't changed a bit - - - maybe more responsible, but I think we all tend to become that once outside the sheltering walls of an institution that pretty well made our decisions for us.<br/></p>                       <p>-2-<br/>There are some very strange people in this world, and no matter how you disagree or argue with them, you can't even get them to admit that they see the other side. For example, this woman in our office (for whom I don't have much admiration, she's terribly ignorantp--she hasn't had any benefits of good education which makesme snotty, I suppose, Because I know I have had a good education) --anyway, we were discussing the open housing issue one day. She <strike>as</strike> said she didn't believe that anyone should be able to tell her to whom she could and could not sell her house, ad then turned around in the same breath and said she thought her neighbors should not be allowed o sell to Negroes because t would hurt the value of her property. How in hell to do argue with someone as prejudiced and ignorant as that? I <strike>din't</strike> didn't bother--simply didn't <strike>g</strike> feel it was worthwhile. She also says that if she ever caught one of her kids so much as speaking to a Negro as a friend - she'd beat the living hell out of the child. She speaks of her children as though they are her property, to be handled as she would handle a house,. It's very disheartening to me, and I can imagine vaguely how absolutely frustrating it must be to you and your fellow Negroes who want nothing more than a truly equal opportunity and a place in this country or this world as a human being with all the priveleges and rights accorded homo sapiens because of the way God made them.</p><p>I could go on and on with things that bother me, examples like the preceding but you don't need examples. I'm not the marching picketing type at all, Julian, but you must remember me as someone who doesn't give with alot of baloney you all the way, I'm extremely proud to have know you--just like I'm proud to have known Jinny Coates (to this day, I firmly believe she is the closest thing to a perfect human being being in relation to other human beings)--and for all the good it may do you, I want you to know this.</p><p>If you have any spare moments to drop me a line, I would like to know how you a line, I would like to know how you are getting along etc. And if you are in the Washington area at any time (your wife and children too), gve me a call.

This is not a very strong bill, but I think it is what Representative Gardner thought he could get out of the Legislature at this time.</p><p>It occurs to me that with the cooperation of forces here in Illinois and your community, we might be able to get out legislation to require textbooks used in our states to present the history of the development of this nation in its true perspective.  As you know, our present history books contain a considerable amount of racial distortion demeaning to the Negro, and intentionally so.  Its effect is to rob our youth of  the dignity and self-respect that should be cultivated in their formative years and prevents their personal growth and security.  On the other side of the ledger, it instills in non-Negros a false sense of superiority and the feeling that racial equality is a myth--never intented to exist in this country.</p><p>I plan to request a Commission to study the problem of racial distortion in our history texts with a view to recommending to the Illinois Legislature a statute which would require that all textbooks used within this state present a true picture of the participation of Negroes in the development of the nation, and as an integral part of history study and social studies.  The Bill I envision should have a date certain, beyond which all schools would be required to use only texts of the type recommended and which would conform to specific guidelines recommended by the Study Commission.</p><p>It would be extremely important if Legislature in other states exhibit an interest in this problem, and express that interest.  A unified approach to this problem, will provide a large enough market and make it easier for textbook manufacturers to do the kind of job that some of them have indicated they would like to do.</p>                       <p>page 2</p><p>It may be that this perhaps is of such a scope that we, as Legislators, may wish to hold a conference on the matter. It is thought that such a conference in its initial stages may best be confidential in nature. Would you kindly react to the above suggestions, including the suggestion on the conferenc and its nature?</p><p>We may also use this opportunity to address ourselves to another crucial phase of the problem--the need for a program in which professionals in the education field will study a balanced history to learn the fallacies inherent in our present texts thus preparing themselves to teach their subjects.</p><p>I am sending this letter to every Negro Legislator sitting in a State body hat I have been able to discover. I am sure that there are some omissions and I would appreciate you informing me of the omissions made. For you convenience, I am listing the name of every person to whom this letter has been sent.

Twombly, would be of interest to you.  It appears in the spring issue of the <u>William and Mary Quarterly</u> which was published last week.</p><p>The article contradicts previous assumptions of historians about the history of the Negro American.  Historians have generally assumed that the Negro never had legal equality before the present civil rights legislation was passed.  Much current thinking about civil rights assumes that we must make a place for the Negro in American society for the first time.</p><p>Our findings reveal that there are legal and social precedents for current civil rights legislation.  Although some seventeenth-century Puritans held derogatory attitudes toward the Negro,  their laws,  had no provision for race or cast.

Among my antecedents were Presidents John Adams and John Quincy Adams as well as other distinguished public servants of their day, before greed for empire became an obsession of this country. I hope you and other negro statesmen to follow wil succeed in breaking the stranglehold of southern bigotry on the powerful Congressional chairmanships which has led to the present state of disgrace.</p><p>I can assure you that you have been already an inspiration to many negro people that I know in Oakland and Berkeley, including visiting students here from Africa.

The project paper will focus on methods of improving communication and increasing mutual awareness between the ghetto student and the small white college.</p><p>Suggestions made to date include: (a)holding a conference supported by several small colleges for high school students from minority groups, explaining and showing them the opportunities available; (b)summer tutoring institutes on white campuses for black students of the 10th and 11th grades; (c)running feature articles in major magazines on the life of the black student on white campuses; (d)inviting guidance counselors from large urban area high schools to college campuses to impress upon them the colleges' desire to have more black applicants.</p><p>We are writing you and some other people whose suggestions and reactions we consider vital to the project, requesting that you comment on your college experience.  What do you consider the social and inadequacies of white colleges?  How can they be remedied? What can the small college do to increase its present contribution to black students? How can more black students be encouraged to apply for admission?</p><p>We would be most grateful to you for any assistance you can give us in coping with this difficult problem.

Hurns, a senior history and political science major at Jackson State College.  I should like to start this letter by saying you are are not, ""The Infamous Mr. Bond"", with me.  Several weeks ago I was reading an article that appeared in Post magazine, (May 6, 1967), written by Marshall Frady, entitled:  ""The Infamous Mr. Bond"".  Even though I fully understood the title, I was somewhat moved enough to write this letter.</p><p>Mr. Bond many of us in the State of Mississippi follwed your struggle to be seated closely.  Especially those of us who were SNICK workers, or those of us who had previously been connected with the organization.  Although I am no longer actively connected with the orginization.  At one time I was very active with one segment of the organization, which was The Southern Student Organizing Committee.  I suppose everyone became bored with organizations and leave.  This was my case.</p><p>Your continued fight with the Georgia legislators at some urging from your family, and especially your father was a sign of heroism, and patriotism in its finest form, as far as I am concerned.  This stand of yours served as a moral booster for others in American society who wished to speak out, but were afraid to do so.  Partly because of you many other people have stood up for their convictions.  Which I feel is in the best traditions of our society.</p><p>Mr. Bond, needless to say you have a very fine father.  Atlanta University is also a nice institution.  As a matter of fact, I am considering Atlanta University for graduate work in September of 1968.  In 1965, I visited the city of Atlanta, and Atlanta University.  This was quite a trip.</p><p>Even though you may be ignored in many instances by your fellow lawmakers, don't despair.  You, Mr. Bond have a committment to your fellow man and to stay in the legislature and </p>                       <p>present a challenge to the status que.  I look to you as a leader of our younger generation.  The ""go, go generation"", as it is termed.</p><p>Finally, the members of our generation see you as an idol, not as ""Infamous"".  We see in you, youth, but above all we see leadership --young leadership.  This is the kind of leadership that our world needs so much.  I look forward to hearing from you soon.</p><p>Very truly yours,</p><p>(signature)</p><p>Walter M. Hurns</p><p>Dear ---------</p><p>Many thanks for your very kind letter.

Even though we have made outstanding progress, forest research still faces tremendous task.  We are aware that our forest land is producing only one-half of its potential.  Therefore, we are striving to increase the productivity of the forest land as rapidly as possible through research.</p><p>There are other alarming deficiencies in Georgia forestry.  For example, for each $1.00 paid to landowners, for a stumpage, the value added for harvesting, processing and manufacturing of forest products is only $12.10, whereas, the national average for value added for each $1.00 paid for stumpage is $24.00.</p><p>The Georgia Forest Research Council and its research cooperators are pledged to continue working towards attaining maximum productivity of Georgia's 25,772,200 acres of forest land and to increase the return from forest products in Georgia above the national average through improved harvesting, processing and manufacturing.</p><p>Again, let me thank you for the support that you have given the Georgia Forest Research Council.  With your continued support Georgia forestry can forge ahead, but only through an accelerated program of research designed to fully develop Georgia's vital forest resources.</p><p>Sincerely,</p><p>(signature)</p><p>H.
