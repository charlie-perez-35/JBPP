    "Note that this script continues to use the FTP API, but it is not really necessary anymore. The API is largely important to extract the unique FTP work ID from each work - since we are doing folder-level exports and each folder is now one work, it is just as easy if not easier to just look up the work ID and manually label each export."

A 1993<br/>\\nleadership study by Brakely, John Price Jones, Inc. showed 74% of all blacks believed<br/>\\nthe NAACP was the leader among all groups with civil rights, race relations and social<br/>\\njustice agendas.  In this study, 75% of all respondents believed the NAACP adequately<br/>\\nrepresented the black community.  An October 1995 <u>US News &amp; World Report</u> poll<br/>\\nreported 90% of all blacks supported the NAACP.  In an April 1998 poll conducted for<br/>\\nthe Foundation for Ethic Understanding, 81% of all blacks reported a favorable opinion<br/>\\nof the NAACP.</p>\\n<p>After 14 years' service on the NAACP Board and ten years as President of the<br/>\\nAtlanta NAACP, and service on the Search Committee, I succeeded Myrlie Evers-Williams as Board Chair in February 1998<br/>\\nand was re-elected unanimously to a second one-year term in February 1999.  Ms. Evers-Williams<br/>\\nrestored integrity to the NAACP's leadership.  She began to retire our staggering debt.<br/>\\nUnder her leadership, a new CEO, former Congressman Kweisi Mfume, was brought on<br/>\\nboard in 1996.  He retired the reamainder of the debt and began to rebuild a staff that had<br/>\\nbeen decimated by debt-induced layoffs.</p>\\n<p>I inherited an organization that was financially stable after having nearly faced<br/>\\nextincion, and an organization with integrity restored.</p>\\n<p>Under the NAACP's Constitution, the Board's Chair has few powers, but I was<br/>\\ndetermined to exercise the powers I had.</p>\\n<p>I began by reducing the number of Board committees from 23 to 16, and I used<br/>\\ntemporary task forces where no committee had jurisdiction.</p>\\n<p>And I tried to attack some of the built-in weaknesses and other structural<br/>\\nimpediments to a smooth running operation.</p>\\n<p>One large challenge faced early was membership fees.

I was successful in getting the<br/>\\nBoard to reduce this confusing array of membership fees, to triple the basic adult<br/>\\nmembership fee to $30.00 and to raise other fees.</p>\\n<p>In spite of past experience in which membership temporarily declined after fees<br/>\\nwere raised, our membership has grown.  Since the fees were raised, membership has<br/>\\nincreased by 100,000.</p>\\n<p>Part of the increase is due to the adoption of membership retention and renewal<br/>\\nefforts which are standard at every similar membership organizaiton, but which did not<br/>\\nexist at the NAACP.  All our membership saless were face-to-face.  We had <u>no organized<br/>\\nsystem</u> of annual membership renewal.  We never wrote to members in anticipation of <br/>\\ntheir membership expiration date to ask them to renew, but we began to do so on an<br/>\\nexperimental basis and plan to do so nation-wide beginning in February 2000.</p>\\n<p>A second cause of membership growth has been a large increase in youth<br/>\\nmemberships and in new youth units chargered - over 35 in the last two years.  They range<br/>\\nfrom the campuses of Harvard and Stanford Universities to the small towns of Piney<br/>\\nWoods, Mississippi, and Jasper, Texas, and demonstrate that there is great interst among<br/>\\nyoung black people in fighting for civil rights.</p>\\n<p>In addition to reviving the Harvard Chapter, we have developed a highly<br/>\\nsuccessful relationship with the Harvard Business School.</p>\\n<p>Mrs. Evers-Williams and Board member Nancy Lane had begun a relationship<br/>\\nwith Professor James Austin and the Harvard Business School's Initiative on Social<br/>\\nEnterprise.  <strike>One result was the case study before you.</strike></p>\\n<p>Of special importance to the NAACP were sessions in the spring of 1998 and<br/>\\n1999 here at the Business School in which the NAACP Board, under the guidance of<br/>\\nHBS faculty, explored issues of governance, CEO/Board relations, Board development,<br/>\\nand strategy.  A third retreat will be held in April 2000.</p>\\n<p>These have proven to be invaluable, bringing the 64 members together, not in a<br/>\\nsometimes-contntious clash of egos and personal agendas common to past Board<br/>\\nmeetings but in a less formal setting that fosters congeniality.

       "  'content': \"\\n<p>Indeed, one of the most important areas of consensus to emerge from the most<br/>\\nrecent retreat was near unanimous agreement on what the NAACP priority should be - advocacy.  It may seem odd that a<br/>\\n90-year-old organization has to agree about what it is and what it does - let me explain.<br/>\\nOver the last several decades, the NAACP has been the victim of success and mission<br/>\\ncreep, spurred, in part by a collapse of an agreed upon division of labor within the civil<br/>\\nrights community, by the withdrawal of support for racial integregation by white Americans<br/>\\nin recent years and the enormity of the needs of our core constituency, black Americans.</p>\\n<p>At the beginning of the 20th century movement for human dignity, there was<br/>\\ninformal agrrment, for example, that the NAACP and the National Urban League would<br/>\\nperform different tasks and assume different roles.  The Urban League would do what is<br/>\\ngeneerally known as social service, helping black migrants from rural to urban America<br/>\\nadjust to an industrial society; the NAACP would fight for civil rights.</p>\\n<p>For much of the 29th century, this division of labor held.  But as petty apartheid<br/>\\nwas eliminated in the mid-60s and it bacame clear that white supremacy had not<br/>\\ndisappeared but had become more subtle, both the NAACP and the Urban League began<br/>\\nto attach a wider range of the problems that plagued black Americans -- unemployment,<br/>\\nskill and educational disadvantage, and so on.  The Urban League increasingly began to<br/>\\nattack racial discrimination and the NAACP began to develop programs to improve the<br/>\\nquality of education available to black Americans -- worthy efforts, but erasing the<br/>\\nprevious allotment of responsibility.</p>\\n<p>One result was the adoption lf a large number of social service programs by the<br/>\\nNAACP and a consequent reduction of our efforts in social justice.  Social service<br/>\\nprograms are immensely popular within the NAACP and have a large constituency; they<br/>\\nmeet needs most agree must be met.  Additionally, they attract corporate and foundation<br/>\\nsupport not available to social justice programs.  Corporate and foundation support of<br/>\\nsocial service is also a reflection of the shift in public discourse about race - a shift from<br/>\\ndiscrimination as cause to remediation as remedy with absolution granted for the<br/>\\npedjudices of the white majority and solutions expected from self-improvement efforts of<br/>\\nthe black minority.  Most whites think discrimination has vanished and equality of<br/>\\nopportunity now exists; such beliefs aren't conducive to rallying cross racial support for fighting racial<br/>\\ndiscrimination.</p>\\n<p>[page[ 3</p>\\n\",\n",

Where once we stood<br/>\\nalone as the unquestioned champion of black rights, the current <u>National Directory of<br/>\\nAfrican-American Organizations</u> lists approximately 250 nationwide organizations<br/>\\ngenerally dedicated to racial uplife, more than half established only since the middle<br/>\\n1960s.  Their growth is a reflection of the successes of affirmative action, generating<br/>\\nopportunity that created black professional organizations that could not have existed<br/>\\nbefore.  These groups do for their members --  black engineers, architects, skiers, elected<br/>\\nofficials, public administrators, Ivy League admissions officers -- what the NAACP alone<br/>\\nwould have done in years past.</p>\\n<p>The challenge of focusing our mission more sharply, the widespread belief that<br/>\\nthe racial paradise had arrived and the increased competition we faced from specialized,<br/>\\nsinge-issue organizations posed a threat to a precious resource -- our identity our relevance -- to who we<br/>\\nare and what we do.</p>\\n<p>At our most recent HBS retreat this past spring, we reaffirmed our commitment to<br/>\\nsocial justice -- that is who we are and what we do.
