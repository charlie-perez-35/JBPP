## The Papers of Julian Bond Storymap

A basis for interactive visualizations of the Bond papers *Series I: Speeches and Articles*. 
This project produced a CSV table which was converted into a tile layer
in ArcGIS Online, the basis for an interactive map by which users can navigate
the Bond Papers content. 

The final product synthesizes data visualization and traditional historical analysis,
but is intended more as a Table of Contents than a standalone analysis.
Users are encouraged to link back to the original source material.
