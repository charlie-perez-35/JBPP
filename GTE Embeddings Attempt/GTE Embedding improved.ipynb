This might need to be further nested, too - I need a way to track at least one of the embeddings (call it the \"source\" embedding, so I'll need to sort the speeches chronologically), so I can compare it (can I make an embedding a key? That seems very messy). Store the embedding in a tensor? Can I append things to a tensor?\n",
