    "In an effort to be more Pythonic, I am going to separate out the schema setup from the actual data analysis aspect of this project - I know this isn't exactly elite in terms of best coding practices, but I'm at least making an effort :).\n",

    "I do think I may return to the old script, or at least create something similarly structured, to work in the realm of paraphrase - but I have not yet decided on that.\n",
    "\n",
    "A note on file sizes: `EMB_sentences_0` and `EMB_sentences_1` are quite large (slightly under 300 MB). I wanted to capture the embeddings somehow, because the most time consuming part of the process is the calculation of those sentence embeddings. But it may present a memory problem. The `EMB_documents` and `EMB_sentences_2` files are much smaller, but require, at a minimum, `EMB_sentences_1` for reference.\n",

We, of course, are the who who haven't gotten any of anything from you know who. There can be no denying then that the direction Black and poor people and their allies must take in the remainder of the 1970s is toward a real and meaningful participation in a new politics. That is because it is politics that decides, in the end, what kind of life each of us will have, what kind of world we live in, what kind of futures our children will have.

It is politics that decides that we must live in second and third hand homes that others have discarded or in vertical prisons of concrete and class designed by some architect who lives in the suburbs. It is politics that made it impossible for so many of us to earn a living back home, and ran us into the cities to be squeezed together like sardines in a can, and it is politics that will enable us to take over the cities where we live, and turn them into the kinds of places where everyone wants to live and raise their children. \n",

As a young girl, she had been given away as a wedding present to a new bride, and when that bride became pregnant, her husband — that's my great-grandmother's owner and master — exercised his right to take his wife's slave as his mistress.

It is not ours to argue whether we will be segregated or whether we ought to be caste. We are segregated; we are a caste. Our problem is: how far and in what way can we consciously and scientifically guide our future so as to insure our physical survival, our spiritual freedom and our social growth? If America proposed the murder of our group, its moral descent into imbecility and crime and its utter loss of manhood, self-assertion and courage, the sooner we realize this the better.
