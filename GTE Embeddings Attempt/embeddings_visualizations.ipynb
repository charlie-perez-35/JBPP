    "In an effort to be more Pythonic, I am going to separate out the schema setup from the actual data analysis aspect of this project - I know this isn't exactly elite in terms of best coding practices, but I'm at least making an effort :).\n",

    "I do think I may return to the old script, or at least create something similarly structured, to work in the realm of paraphrase - but I have not yet decided on that.\n",
    "\n",
    "A note on file sizes: `EMB_sentences_0` and `EMB_sentences_1` are quite large (slightly under 300 MB). I wanted to capture the embeddings somehow, because the most time consuming part of the process is the calculation of those sentence embeddings. But it may present a memory problem. The `EMB_documents` and `EMB_sentences_2` files are much smaller, but require, at a minimum, `EMB_sentences_1` for reference.\n",
