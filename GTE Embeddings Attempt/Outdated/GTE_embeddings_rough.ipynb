It meant re-installing in power those who believe in privilege for the powerful and neglect of the powerless. It meant giving a four year free hand to the current occupants of Uncle ]\\xa03 Strom\\'s cabin, a free hand to men who have demonstrated they have no concern whatsoever for freedom of the press, for the privacy of the individual, or for the constitutionally guaranteed civil rights and liberties we have all begun should\\xa0like to believe were\\xa0are taken for granted by those who govern us.\\nMr. Nixon now has his four more years to put his men on the Supreme Court, to turn it back into the liberal social force it used to be or to continue its current trend toward repression.\\n4\\nHe will continue to set the budget and name the directors of the Department of Health, Education and Welfare, the Department of Housing and Urban Development, the Department of Justice and the Federal Bureau of Intimidation.\\nHe will continue to decide whether stocks go up or down, whether money is loose or tight, whether our weekly paychecks buy more or less, or whether they buy anything at all.\\nHe has got now, in fact, four years in which to shape America to his mold, to recruit from the frightened a constituency against the forgotten, to shape his new majority into a force that will\\xa0may continue to rule through fear and division.\\nA short while ago, the National Urban Coalition tried to spell out what was wrong in this county, and how it could be set right.\\n\"America\\'s malaise,\" they said, \"--which all of us feel in one way or another -- has its roots in the distance between national ideal\\n5\\nand national reality.\"\\nOur ideal is a country where every American gets an equal chance to perform, where jobs exist for everyone who wants one, where health care and personal safety are assured, where we live in harmony with each other and have a decent place to live.\"\\n\"Our reality needs no full recital here. We know that cities are in trouble, that poverty continues in the midst of wealth, that unemployment is high, that malnutrition is widespread, that injustice exists, that tensions endure. In sum, we know that our society is not functioning the way it is supposed to.\"\\n\"But if we solve the greatest of our ills,\" the Coalition said, \"our paralysis of spirit and will, we can narrow the distance between what we have and what we want. Indeed, we must marshal our good sense and our good will. There is no sensible alternative.\"\\nIn the Coalition view \"America must pursue several major goals\\n6\\nbetween now and the future.\" It must try to:\\n\"Achieve full employment with a high level of economic growth — all of our other policy goals depend upon it.\\n\"Provide all citizens with an equal opportunity to participate in American society and in the shaping of governmental decisions affecting their lives. ]\\xa05\\n\"Guarantee that no American will go without the basic necessities: food, shelter, health care, a healthy environment, personal safety, and an adequate income.\\n\"Meet our obligations to assist in the economic development of the world\\'s lesser developed nations.\\n\"These are the goals. We can move a long way toward them by 1976.\"1\\nBut in addition to the Coalition\\'s major goals, and their definition of \"paralysis of will\" as the greatest of our ills, there is another goal much more desirable, another ill much more horrible. That ill is\\n7\\nracism; the goal its containment and eradication.\\nEveryone knows, or ought to know, that there is one consuming problem that makes life in New York\\'s Harlem, Cleveland\\'s Hough, Los Angeles\\' Watts, or Atlanta\\'s Vine City or any of America\\'s other urban or\\xa0rural\\xa0Atticas — where some men are held in bondage by some other men — both intolerable and insufferable.\\nThat problem is race. It is race that elected our present President in 1968; race that makes some Americans serve and die more readily than others in Vietnam; race that makes some children more educated than others; race that colors all of our lives.\\nFor the past several years, solutions to the problems of race, and ]\\xa06 therefore to the pathologies of society that spring from it, have been more than abundant.\\nThere are several solutions that, if implemented, would begin to make this country a proper place for men and women to live and work and\\n[The following page appears to be a new addition to the speech.

And for four more years we will have leadership in the White House that believes that the American people are children, ]\\xa07 after all, who must be bullied and protected by the great white father.\\nBlack Americans traditionally looked to the congress, the courts, and for a few short years — the white house — for our political salvation. Now we must suffer from the results of an election that was really a national referendum on us, on whether we would progress, run in place, or continue sliding backward as we have been doing since 1968.\\n(page 15)\\ndelete line beginning \"FOR BLACK AMERICANS.…\\n[The following page returns to the initial speech content and typeset.]\\n8\\na healthy place for our children to play and grow and learn.\\nThe nation could adopt, and strive for, a policy of full employment.\\nEqual opportunity, both racially and sexually, can stop being the rhetoric of campaigns and platforms and become the reality of the present.\\nThrough public service employment, increased economic growth, increases in wage minimums and in guaranteeing social insurance by radically altering public assistance, every American can be guaranteed an income.\\nThe institution of a national health insurance program and a radical alteration of federal housing programs will additionally aid in making both urban and rural America more attractive places to live.\\n[The following additions and strikethrough are handwritten in red pen.]\\nOf course, none of these things will ever be done, unless and until there is increased interest among the people who need and want them in replacing the new and no apparently longer silent majority with a noisy and agitated majority movement of the now\\xa0hostile dispossessed and\\xa0unrepresented who will seek political solutions to their common political problems.\\n9\\nFor too many young Americans\\xa0nearly\\xa0half\\xa0of\\xa0the\\xa0country\\xa0on\\xa0election\\xa0day, the possibility of an exchange of presidents meant nothing more than an exchange of photographs on the post office wall, or on a dormitory wall dart board. For Black people, the election was a national referendum on us, ofn whether we would progress, run in place, or continue to slide sliding backward as we have been doing since 1968.\\nSince Richard Nixon took office in 1968, we have spent billions more on war; over two million more Americans have been added to the ranks of the unemployed; six million more are on ever mounting relief rolls, inflation has reduced our standard of living, and elitist, sexist and racist practices run rampant, unchecked through public and private American life.\\nThese practices will not be ended by some catyclismic revolution anytime soon — they can be dented, however, by hard work and by concerted political and social action, if that action can gather together the best of what is left of the old coalition.\\n10\\nThat has been the history of Black people\\'s lives and\\xa0politics in America — constant pressure and agitation, with or without allies — aimed at improving our position. ]\\xa08\\nWhat has happened in the United States since the first Black people set foot here in 1619 the\\xa0year\\xa0before\\xa0the\\xa0Mayflower\\xa0arrived is that everything has changed and nothing has changed.,\\xa0particularly for us in the South.\\nFor one, we are no longer slaves. Secondly, we can sit at lunch counters, sit downstairs at movie theatres, ride in the front of buses, register\\xa0,and vote ,work\\xa0and\\xa0go\\xa0to\\xa0school where we once could not.\\nBut in a great many ways, we are constantly discovering that things have either not changed at all, or have become much worse.\\nA quick look at all of the facts and figures that measure how well, or how poorly, a people are doing — the kinds of statistics that measure infant mortality, unemployment, median family income, life expectancy — demonstrates clearly that the average Black American, while better off in\\xa0comparison\\n11\\nthan his father was, is actually worse off when his statistics are measured against similar ones for white people.\\nIt is as though Black Americans are climbing a molasses mountain in snowshoes, while white people are riding a the\\xa0rest\\xa0of\\xa0the\\xa0country\\xa0rides\\xa0a\\xa0rather\\xa0leisurly ski lift to the tope.\\nIt is these depressing figures, and the accompanying pathology which results from them, that causes so much discontent and depression in Black communities today.\\nThe realization is that separately over the years the diverse ]\\xa09 strategies of Booker T. Washington and Dr. W. E. B. Dubois and Marcus Garvey and Martin Luther King and Malcolm X have not separately appreciably improved the material lot of the masses of Black folk.\\nThe separate agitations these philosophies gave birth to — either a return to Mother Africa, a struggle in the courts, a nonviolent thrust into the streets, a violent attempt at doing real injury to white America —\\n12\\nall these have accustomed many white people to believe that Black people have by now got everything we want, and half of what white folks have, too.\\nBut the problem so often referred to as America\\'s Black problem — in reality a massive white problem — continues. It continues despite wars on poverty and great societies and new frontiers and will continue despite the new federalism.\\nThe roots of the problem are deep in the fabric of this country, and began with the rape of Africa, the stealing of child from mother, the separation of husband from wife, the destruction of various cultures and religions imposition\\xa0of\\xa0an\\xa0alien\\xa0religion\\xa0on\\xa0an\\xa0already\\xa0religious\\xa0group\\xa0of\\xa0people, the displacement of a whole people from their land and their country.\\nThey involve the basest of prejudices, an economic system that has always believed property was more important than people — the results have been to place and keep Black people at the bottom of the ladder that in this nation is supposed to lead to jobs and homes and education\\n13\\nand security.\\nIt has made us the last to be hired and the first to be fired; it has recently, as any reading of the\\xa0decade\\'s Vietnam casualty lists will show, made our young men first in war, last in peace, and seldom in the hearts of our countryemn. It has given Black children an opportunity to attend school for twelve years while receiving only six years of education. It has placed us on relief to where we are called lazy and shiftless while 6,000 white American farmers are paid $25,000 each a year not to work, and while oil millionaires receive an automatic 27-1/2% tax write off every year farm.\\nIn short, we are in bad shape. The gains made yesterday are vanishing today. The victories won in the years of 1954 and 1960 are being negated by the winner of the battle of \\'68 and the rout of \\'72.\\nThe question remains for the future — will it happen again? continue? continue\\xa0to\\xa0happen?\\nWhat is happening now happened once before in American history in the\\n14\\nyears after Reconstruction. In both cases, a president made a cynical deal, not just with the unreconstructed South, but with the national unreconstructed mentality that believed then as it believes now, that the American social agenda must\\xa0should not include those at the bottom of the ladder.\\nIn return for political support, the national government in Washington ]\\xa011 agreed to let the white South handle its Negroes social\\xa0issue in its own way.\\nThe promises made then that Black people would be included in nthe social and economic life of the nation were repudiated.

Americans today see their cities made unlivable; they see meaningless hard work done by many for the benefit of a few; they see themselves channeled by parents, schools, and draft boards; their passions and skills cannot find an outlet in present-day society. The question for their future is whether they can be counted upon to discontinue the American tradition of racial arrogance.\\nBut for white people in general, those presently satisfied with life as it is, but yearning — with all evident sincerity — to do something to alleviate the Black condition, there is a program as well, spelled out by Frederick Douglass in 1894:\\n\"Now what the real problem is, we all ought to know. It is not a\\n23\\nNegro problem, but in every sense a national problem. It involves the question of whether or not after all their boasted civilization, their Declaration of Independence, their matchless Constitution, their sublime Christianity, their wise statesmanship, whether they as a people possess virtue enough to solve their problem.\\nBut how can their problem be solved? Let the white people of the North and South conquer their prejudices. Let them give up the idea that to degrade the colored man is to elevate the white man. Let them cease putting new wine into old bottles, or mending old garments with new cloth. Let them cultivate kindness and humanity . . . .\\nThey are not required to do much. They are only required to undo the evil they have done, in order to solve their problem . . . .\\nPut away your race prejudice. Banish the idea that one class must rule over another. Recognize the fact that the rights of the humblest of citizens are as worthy of recognition as the rights of the highest, and\\n24\\nyour problem will be solved and — whatever may be in store for you in the future, whether prosperity or adversity, whether you have foes without or foes within, whether there shall be peace or war — based on the eternal principles of truth, justice and humanity, with no class having cause for complaint or grievance, your republic will stand and flourish forever.\"\\n-30-\\n[The following page is a typewritten insert.]\\ndelete all x-d on 22, all of 23 and 24, and replace with:\\n[Handwritten in red pen and circled] insert\\nWe hear a great deal of talk — just after and just before American elections — about real majorities, and new majorities and silent and noisy ones, and about which candidate failed to seize the center and ]\\xa016 which one was extreme.\\nPast election history demosntrates that the people will care about each other when they are taught to do so, not lectured but taught.
