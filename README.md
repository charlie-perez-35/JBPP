# The Julian Bond Papers Project

### By Charlie Perez

Hello! This is the GitHub repository for some of the code I've written as part of the 
[Julian Bond Papers Project](https://bondpapersproject.org/). It is far from perfect, and many things are hardcoded.
But I hope it may form a template for future apprentices, editors, or digital humanities scholars
to use and create useful tools. Most of this code has been written with the philosophy that some automation
is better than no automation. And I will try to organize my file structure better going forward.

If you find this useful, yay! Consider giving the Julian Bond Papers Project some love.
