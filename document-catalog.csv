Violence is black children going to school for 12 years and receiving 5 years of education.
Violence is 30 million hungry stomachs in the most alfluent nation on earth.
Violence is having black people represent a disproportionate share of inductees and casualties in Vietnam.
Violence is a country where properrty counts more than people.
Violence is ancon economy that believes in socialism for the rich and capitalism for the poor.
Violence is spending $900 a a year per second to stifle the Vietnamese, but only $77 a year to feed the hungry people at home.
Violence is spending $78 billion to kill and only $12 billion to make whole.
Ciolence is j
Violence is J. Edgar Hoover listening to your telephone conversation; violence is an Assistant Attornye ey Attorney General proposing concentragjk camps for white concentration camps for white and black A militants.
Violence is 6,000 American farmers receiving $25,000 not to work.
Violence is the Congress of the U.S. putting cotton, tobacco, rice and cattle ahead of the people.
Violence is Richard Nixon and Spiral Agneew ignoring the expression of peace of millions of Americans.

Speech — Julian Bond — 11111
Not an exact text
Life in the United States for some people is progressively getting worse.
For Black people, the statistics; facts of life — those figures that reflect infant mortality, unemployment, median family income, life expectancy — all these reveal that while our general position has improved, our relative position (relative to white America) — has worsened.
For poor people, especially those forced to live at public expense at the below-subsistence level every state provides for its poor, life is about to get much worse.
The President of the United States, for example, has proposed that welfare recipients register for work or job training, but he has not provided any jobs for them. He has indicated he may discontinue food stamps, leaving may of the near subsistence poor poorer
2
in diet than they were before.
He has assumed — as most Americans do — that welfare recipients are all layabout able bodied men, or slatterns who regularly have children in order to reap the vast benefits of the welfare state. When these benefits at their highest median are about $40 a month per child, one may assume that few mothers are induced to bear and rear children for $40.
In point of fact, of the nine million people currently receiving some kind of public assistance in the United States, 5 million are children, unable to work; 2 million are elderly, unable to work; 1 million are blind and disabled—unable to work; 1 1/2 million are mothers of school age children, and 80,000 are male adults, most of whom are unprepared to compete for jobs in today's technological society.
3
Others groups in today's society are beginning to suffer as well. College students, long considered a privileged class, will discover as they return to school this month that over 25 states have passed repressive legislation aimed at keeping them in their place.
The State of Louisiana has passed a bill which defines a riot as a disturbance caused by three or more persons.
The West Virginia Legislature has passed a bill which allows policemen to impress any citizen at the scene of a riot into police service, and which absolves policemen from guilt if a policemen kills or injures a rioter and dispenses equally the guilt to all persons engaged in a riot if a policeman is injured or killed.
But it is Black people who have suffered most, and who will probably suffer more.
4
Recent events in Chicago and Pittsburg show how determined the people are who have called themselves the Black man's friend — the building trade labor unions — how determined they are to keep Black people the last to be hired and the first to be fired.
Everywhere you look, there is evidence that Black people are facing a second period of gloom and despair, like the first one that followed Reconstruction, . In both periods, after that first Reconstruction and following what Black people believed was the second one, the result was the same, . In both periods, Black people believed that racial equality and democracy could be won through the courts, through negotiation and on occasion direct action, and through strong alliances with liberal white groups.
In both periods, the white allies of Black people became tired and interested in other concerns, and the Black problem
5
was no longer considered solely a Southern problem.
In both periods, the result of the abandonment and frustration and powerlessness Black people felt was bitterness, despair and withdrawal.
When Reconstruction ended, the decades that followed resulted in the culmination of institutionalized racism — ""The enactment and enforcement of laws requiring or permitting racial segregation in all aspects of American life,"" imposed by white racists with the ""apathy, indifference and quiet acceptance of white moderates and liberals who served as necessary accessories.""*
The similarity between that period and this one is frightening.
6
Following that first period, when armed federal troops patrolled the South, when Black and white children went to school together peacefully, when integrated state legislatures abolished imprisonment for debt, established free male suffrage, organized the South's first free public education, following that period, an American Presidential candidate made a deal with the rebellious South, troops were withdrawn, and Jim Crow began to fly over the land.
The exact same thing happened in Miami in 1968. There, an American Presidential candidate entered into an illicit and adulterous political relationship with the Cinderella Bridegroom and notorious land speculator from South Carolina, a relationship intended to convince the solid South that Nixon and not the hillbilly Hitler from Alabama was indeed, the one. The offspring of that relationship are being seen today.
7
[This page is handwritten.]
The illigitimate children include:
The sell-out of the new Reconstruction can be seen in the notorious Eastland bill, reviving the Smith act, making treason a peacetime crime, requiring loyalty oaths before passports are issued.
It is seen in the Johnson administration's persecutions in the Spock case, and in the Nixon administration's persecutions — under the Thurmond inspired anti-riot act — of the Chicago eight.
8
The ugly hand of appeasement is seen in allowing segregated school districts, districts that have already had more than fifteen 16 Septembers or 15 years years to obey the law of the land, in giving them still more time in which to integrate their school systems with all deliberate speed.
It is wrong, however, to make the unreconstructed South the only villian. There are villains everywhere.
They are the decent people of the United States who have always thought that poverty was only a state of mind, or that the unemployed are simply lazy, or that Black people really don't suffer from discrimination.
[The following sentence is circled in pen.]
The combination of villains in power and out of power has brought us to where we are today.
9
[The following page is handwritten.]

They are the villians who do nothing when a government fires a teacher on a paid informant's say so.
they are the civil rights and civil liberties enthusiasts who do nothing when militant black groups, like the panthers, are decimated by police repression, their leaders forced into exile or held incomunicado by police.
They are the decent people who laughed at the idea of concentration camps in the United States and who will laugh all the way into them.
They are the people who stand and watch as the noose grows tighter.

That combination of villians in and out of power has bought us where we are today
10
Today the center of gravity of what used to be called the civil rights movement has moved from the sharecropper's shack to the urban ghetto, where it is now ""immobilized by ambiguity and by intensified white resistance and indifference."" Successful litigation, strong legislation, free access to public accomodations, strong pronouncements on the part of Presidents, Governors or Mayors and even the right to vote and hold office are not relevant to the overriding fact that the masses of Negroes Black people are still confined to poverty and to the dehumanizing conditions of the ghetto.
Because the southern Black masses have been forgotten by the very students who are discovering problems — and power — on the college campus, because urban Black people see that no Great
11
Society is coming their way and that the war on poverty they have been fighting has already been lost surrendered, there is a new politics arising in America.
It is not a new politics in the Eugene McCarthy sense, with bright, clean young people knocking on doors and soliciting votes; it is a new political process that began in Watts in 1964, and traveled from there to Newark and Detroit. It is a new process that began in Berkeley and moved to Columbia and culminated at Cornell. And while is is new and strange to many, it is as old as America itself. It is a part of the process that believes that when life becomes intolerable and government unresponsive and unrepresentative, then men have not just got the right but the duty to rise up against it and strike it down.
12
Not everyone behaves as did Black people in Watts or white students at Columbia; But this new process, if stretched, enfolds farmers who shoot their pigs and dump their milk, tenants refusing to pay their rent, housewives picketing the A. & P., high school student boycotting classes. '
Aall these people with one hundred different motives, are caught up in believing, with good cause, that no no cares for them. That is true of Black people in the cities and down on the farm, it is true of American Indians on and off the reservation, and it is true of labor union members who sat down and seized control of a Ford plant in Flint, Michigan in 1937 but who cannot understand today's demonstrations. students seizing an administration building.
What is true is that the nation has failed; it has had its successes and is able to spend $30 billion dollars a year to interfere in the future of 14 million South Vietnamese but cannot
13
bring itself to spend one-half that amount to insure a decent future for 227 million poor Black and white Americans.
The nation is likely to continue to fail as long as we continue to do nothing; as long as Saigon holds priority over Selma; as long as men on the moon are worth more than men on earth.
That failure could be rectified by America's young people, those who are now engaged in restructuring the American University. A tremendous job waits for them, if they can discover that outside the ivied walls of the university there lies a large, hostile world, and if they can carry their concern and energy into that world, then a chance appears.
A chance for the poor Black people of this nation, for the forgotten poor white man, the other colored non-white Americans whose lives
14
are a daily hell.
Someone once, in describing the late Dr. Martin Luther King, quoted from Genesis and said:
""Behold, here comes the dreamer. Let us slay him and see what will become of his dreams.""
Those who refuse to take some kind of action are killers of the dream. It was Frederick Douglass who said:
""We are here, and here we are likely to be. To imagine that we shall be eradicated is absurd and ridiculous. We may be remodified, changed, and assimilated, but never extinquished. We repeat, therefore, that we are here; and that this is our country . . . we shall neither die out, or be driven out, but shall go with these people, either as a testimony against them,
15
or as an evidence in their favor throughout generations.""
The choice has never been ours. It has always been yours.

George McGovern.
[Handwritten dashes in red pen.] - ---- -- --- -
If the election on November 7th illuminated any political movement at all, it was the movement of the comfortable, the callous and the smug closing their ranks — and closing their hearts — against the claims and calls to conscience put forward by the forgotten and unrepresented elements in American society.
Despite the talk about Eagleton, Watergate, the war, welfare, quotas, bussing, taxes McGovern's shifts on policy and platform, the last minute Kissinger peace initiative, the central issue was clear.
As the Reverend Jesse Louis Jackson has put it, ""It's not the bus — it's us.""
There is something wrong with an election that sees one candidate receiving nearly all of the Black votes cast, and the other candidate receiving more than three-quarters of the white votes cast.
This does not describe a race between Democrats and Republicans, or
3
even between two men named Nixon and McGovern — this was rather a national referendum on what has politely been called ""the social issue"".
For Black people in America, the election results on November 7th signaled consigning nearly all our political hopes and dreams to a political an oblivion from which they may never emerge. It meant re-installing in power those who believe in privilege for the powerful and neglect of the powerless. It meant giving a four year free hand to the current occupants of Uncle ] 3 Strom's cabin, a free hand to men who have demonstrated they have no concern whatsoever for freedom of the press, for the privacy of the individual, or for the constitutionally guaranteed civil rights and liberties we have all begun should like to believe were are taken for granted by those who govern us.
Mr. Nixon now has his four more years to put his men on the Supreme Court, to turn it back into the liberal social force it used to be or to continue its current trend toward repression.
4
He will continue to set the budget and name the directors of the Department of Health, Education and Welfare, the Department of Housing and Urban Development, the Department of Justice and the Federal Bureau of Intimidation.
He will continue to decide whether stocks go up or down, whether money is loose or tight, whether our weekly paychecks buy more or less, or whether they buy anything at all.
He has got now, in fact, four years in which to shape America to his mold, to recruit from the frightened a constituency against the forgotten, to shape his new majority into a force that will may continue to rule through fear and division.
A short while ago, the National Urban Coalition tried to spell out what was wrong in this county, and how it could be set right.
""America's malaise,"" they said, ""--which all of us feel in one way or another -- has its roots in the distance between national ideal
5
and national reality.""
Our ideal is a country where every American gets an equal chance to perform, where jobs exist for everyone who wants one, where health care and personal safety are assured, where we live in harmony with each other and have a decent place to live.""
""Our reality needs no full recital here. We know that cities are in trouble, that poverty continues in the midst of wealth, that unemployment is high, that malnutrition is widespread, that injustice exists, that tensions endure. In sum, we know that our society is not functioning the way it is supposed to.""
""But if we solve the greatest of our ills,"" the Coalition said, ""our paralysis of spirit and will, we can narrow the distance between what we have and what we want. Indeed, we must marshal our good sense and our good will. There is no sensible alternative.""
In the Coalition view ""America must pursue several major goals
6
between now and the future."" It must try to:
""Achieve full employment with a high level of economic growth — all of our other policy goals depend upon it.
""Provide all citizens with an equal opportunity to participate in American society and in the shaping of governmental decisions affecting their lives. ] 5
""Guarantee that no American will go without the basic necessities: food, shelter, health care, a healthy environment, personal safety, and an adequate income.
""Meet our obligations to assist in the economic development of the world's lesser developed nations.
""These are the goals. We can move a long way toward them by 1976.""1
But in addition to the Coalition's major goals, and their definition of ""paralysis of will"" as the greatest of our ills, there is another goal much more desirable, another ill much more horrible. That ill is
7
racism; the goal its containment and eradication.
Everyone knows, or ought to know, that there is one consuming problem that makes life in New York's Harlem, Cleveland's Hough, Los Angeles' Watts, or Atlanta's Vine City or any of America's other urban or rural Atticas — where some men are held in bondage by some other men — both intolerable and insufferable.
That problem is race. It is race that elected our present President in 1968; race that makes some Americans serve and die more readily than others in Vietnam; race that makes some children more educated than others; race that colors all of our lives.
For the past several years, solutions to the problems of race, and ] 6 therefore to the pathologies of society that spring from it, have been more than abundant.
There are several solutions that, if implemented, would begin to make this country a proper place for men and women to live and work and

Of course, none of the above is likely to happen. Our Congress — overwhelmingly Democratic — is atrophied, cautious and frightened of the President.

And for four more years we will have leadership in the White House that believes that the American people are children, ] 7 after all, who must be bullied and protected by the great white father.
Black Americans traditionally looked to the congress, the courts, and for a few short years — the white house — for our political salvation. Now we must suffer from the results of an election that was really a national referendum on us, on whether we would progress, run in place, or continue sliding backward as we have been doing since 1968.

a healthy place for our children to play and grow and learn.
The nation could adopt, and strive for, a policy of full employment.
Equal opportunity, both racially and sexually, can stop being the rhetoric of campaigns and platforms and become the reality of the present.
Through public service employment, increased economic growth, increases in wage minimums and in guaranteeing social insurance by radically altering public assistance, every American can be guaranteed an income.
The institution of a national health insurance program and a radical alteration of federal housing programs will additionally aid in making both urban and rural America more attractive places to live.
[The following additions and strikethrough are handwritten in red pen.]
Of course, none of these things will ever be done, unless and until there is increased interest among the people who need and want them in replacing the new and no apparently longer silent majority with a noisy and agitated majority movement of the now hostile dispossessed and unrepresented who will seek political solutions to their common political problems.
9
For too many young Americans nearly half of the country on election day, the possibility of an exchange of presidents meant nothing more than an exchange of photographs on the post office wall, or on a dormitory wall dart board. For Black people, the election was a national referendum on us, ofn whether we would progress, run in place, or continue to slide sliding backward as we have been doing since 1968.
Since Richard Nixon took office in 1968, we have spent billions more on war; over two million more Americans have been added to the ranks of the unemployed; six million more are on ever mounting relief rolls, inflation has reduced our standard of living, and elitist, sexist and racist practices run rampant, unchecked through public and private American life.
These practices will not be ended by some catyclismic revolution anytime soon — they can be dented, however, by hard work and by concerted political and social action, if that action can gather together the best of what is left of the old coalition.
10
That has been the history of Black people's lives and politics in America — constant pressure and agitation, with or without allies — aimed at improving our position. ] 8
What has happened in the United States since the first Black people set foot here in 1619 the year before the Mayflower arrived is that everything has changed and nothing has changed., particularly for us in the South.
For one, we are no longer slaves. Secondly, we can sit at lunch counters, sit downstairs at movie theatres, ride in the front of buses, register ,and vote ,work and go to school where we once could not.
But in a great many ways, we are constantly discovering that things have either not changed at all, or have become much worse.
A quick look at all of the facts and figures that measure how well, or how poorly, a people are doing — the kinds of statistics that measure infant mortality, unemployment, median family income, life expectancy — demonstrates clearly that the average Black American, while better off in comparison
11
than his father was, is actually worse off when his statistics are measured against similar ones for white people.
It is as though Black Americans are climbing a molasses mountain in snowshoes, while white people are riding a the rest of the country rides a rather leisurly ski lift to the tope.
It is these depressing figures, and the accompanying pathology which results from them, that causes so much discontent and depression in Black communities today.
The realization is that separately over the years the diverse ] 9 strategies of Booker T. Washington and Dr. W. E. B. Dubois and Marcus Garvey and Martin Luther King and Malcolm X have not separately appreciably improved the material lot of the masses of Black folk.
The separate agitations these philosophies gave birth to — either a return to Mother Africa, a struggle in the courts, a nonviolent thrust into the streets, a violent attempt at doing real injury to white America —
12
all these have accustomed many white people to believe that Black people have by now got everything we want, and half of what white folks have, too.
But the problem so often referred to as America's Black problem — in reality a massive white problem — continues. It continues despite wars on poverty and great societies and new frontiers and will continue despite the new federalism.
The roots of the problem are deep in the fabric of this country, and began with the rape of Africa, the stealing of child from mother, the separation of husband from wife, the destruction of various cultures and religions imposition of an alien religion on an already religious group of people, the displacement of a whole people from their land and their country.
They involve the basest of prejudices, an economic system that has always believed property was more important than people — the results have been to place and keep Black people at the bottom of the ladder that in this nation is supposed to lead to jobs and homes and education
13
and security.
It has made us the last to be hired and the first to be fired; it has recently, as any reading of the decade's Vietnam casualty lists will show, made our young men first in war, last in peace, and seldom in the hearts of our countryemn. It has given Black children an opportunity to attend school for twelve years while receiving only six years of education. It has placed us on relief to where we are called lazy and shiftless while 6,000 white American farmers are paid $25,000 each a year not to work, and while oil millionaires receive an automatic 27-1/2% tax write off every year farm.
In short, we are in bad shape. The gains made yesterday are vanishing today. The victories won in the years of 1954 and 1960 are being negated by the winner of the battle of '68 and the rout of '72.
The question remains for the future — will it happen again? continue? continue to happen?
What is happening now happened once before in American history in the
14
years after Reconstruction. In both cases, a president made a cynical deal, not just with the unreconstructed South, but with the national unreconstructed mentality that believed then as it believes now, that the American social agenda must should not include those at the bottom of the ladder.
In return for political support, the national government in Washington ] 11 agreed to let the white South handle its Negroes social issue in its own way.
The promises made then that Black people would be included in nthe social and economic life of the nation were repudiated. Instead of fulfilling the dream, then as now:

extra-legal maneuvers designed to make us less than political and economic equals;
The hopes and belief of Black people that racial equality and social justice could be achieved through litigation, legislation, negotiation, occasional direct action and strong alliances with white liberal + centrist groups were supplanted by disillusionment, bitterness, and open anger;
The guilt and indignation of Northern supporters of the Southern drive for equality turned into an attitude of first cautious — and now more open — racism when the Northern Black man began to take seriously the claims of progress and began to look for visible signs in Northern cities.2

Reversing the recession of political concern ought to be part of your the American agenda for the remainder of the seventies.
For Black Americans in the future, this will be done increasingly through political action.
Politics, as it has existed for us, is changing. Its history is
16
a sorry one, a history of white repression and Black subjugation, of whites proposing and Blacks disposing. It is a history with only one bright moment, the ten years of Reconstruction, the only ten American years when democracy meant began to mean as much in Mississippi as it did in Maine, the ten years only American decade in which an aggressive national government acted with armed might to protect the economic civil and political rights of the Black political hopefuls population.
From the closing of that period of hope just before the beginning of the twentieth century — the century whose problem, Dr. W.E.B. DuBois said, would be ""The problem of the color line"" to the point just past the middle of the twentieth, Black Americans have seen their our fortunes ebb and rise and now, ebb again.
They have seen political promises made and broken in Washington. From the days when Frederick Douglass said ""The Republican Party is the ship; all else is the sea"" to the days of Franklin Delano Roosevelt, ] 13 Black people have tried first one, and now the other, national political party.

We have been ill served by politicians whem the late Ralph McGill once called ""so grotesque it seems impossible they could have been influential.""

Instead, a new crop of national political leaders has begun the task the white South once believed was theirs alone: Deciding on the proper political, educational, and economic position for the region's Black people.
These people march backward like an off-key Salvation Army band, going into the world to convert the saved into s sinners.
This new group was made of some old faces — a president who rose from the dead, a Southern senator who has belonged to three political parties, and an attorney general who surely must be the first man to hold his job in recent years who can receive a standing ovation from white Mississippians.

Just as that first Reconstruction ended with a deal made in a hotel room,
18
this second 1960s one ended that way too: A deal made in a hotel in Miami Beach in 1968 that gave the white South veto power over Supreme Court nominees, gave the white South hope that the drive to register Black voters would stop, gave the white South hope that the slow pace of school integration would move even slower, and breathed new life into the national mood of resistance to progress for Black people.

The task of beginning again cannot be done by Black people alone, and certainly cannot be done by people who measure their social relevance by the length of their hair or the trickiness of the handshake. College campuses used to be centers for movement and social protest — today, they are havens for the bougaloo, bid whist, and Boone's Farm. A lot of fashionably long hair seems to cover ordinary red necks.
It is frightening to hear those who hide in the sometime safety and temporary sanctuary of the college campus call for the election of George Wallace as a means of ""heightening the contradictions"" and thereby
19

hastening the revolution. That's quite fine in infantile campus revolutionary theory, but it's Black people's contradictions that are being heightened, not theirs.
It is disturbing when people who could spend their time registering voters or organizing the unorganized spend their time instead arguing the relative revisionism of the late Ho Chi Minh.
But Black people will persist.
There is, then, a big job to be begun. It can be done, but it will never be done by people who think they can smoke America to her knees. It will not be done if your major concern is macrobiotic diets, or astrology, or music, or drugs, or boutique radicalism, or the romantic rhetoric of revolution or Boone's Farm or bid whist, or if shouting ""off the pig"" replaces the hard and dirty work of organizing the dispossessed into an effective force for change.

The answer, of course is organization and coalition, with the former first, for the latter asks the question ""with whom?""

political and psychological and sexual and that appeals to the fair play of prejudiced people are like prayers said to the wind.
2. That old patterns will change, and those in power will relinquish power only if they are forced to make a clear-cut choice between continuance of the colonial old relationship and another clear-cut and highly cherished value — economic gain or civil peace or political stability and majority-based power.
3. That conflict and struggle and confrontation are often necessary for social change, and
4. That the rights and lives of real human beings are at stake, and these are in the long run neither ballotable or negotiable. That such negotiation, to be meaningful, must take place between equals acting in good faith and the issues are precisely the good faith — if not the good sense — of white Americans.

Such a movement is beginning to appear among some white youth, motivated perhaps by a surfeit of things American and the debasement of what was thought to be good. Americans today see their cities made unlivable; they see meaningless hard work done by many for the benefit of a few; they see themselves channeled by parents, schools, and draft boards; their passions and skills cannot find an outlet in present-day society. The question for their future is whether they can be counted upon to discontinue the American tradition of racial arrogance.
But for white people in general, those presently satisfied with life as it is, but yearning — with all evident sincerity — to do something to alleviate the Black condition, there is a program as well, spelled out by Frederick Douglass in 1894:
""Now what the real problem is, we all ought to know. It is not a
23
Negro problem, but in every sense a national problem. It involves the question of whether or not after all their boasted civilization, their Declaration of Independence, their matchless Constitution, their sublime Christianity, their wise statesmanship, whether they as a people possess virtue enough to solve their problem.
But how can their problem be solved? Let the white people of the North and South conquer their prejudices. Let them give up the idea that to degrade the colored man is to elevate the white man. Let them cease putting new wine into old bottles, or mending old garments with new cloth. Let them cultivate kindness and humanity . . . .
They are not required to do much. They are only required to undo the evil they have done, in order to solve their problem . . . .
Put away your race prejudice. Banish the idea that one class must rule over another. Recognize the fact that the rights of the humblest of citizens are as worthy of recognition as the rights of the highest, and
24
your problem will be solved and — whatever may be in store for you in the future, whether prosperity or adversity, whether you have foes without or foes within, whether there shall be peace or war — based on the eternal principles of truth, justice and humanity, with no class having cause for complaint or grievance, your republic will stand and flourish forever.""

Those who believed Gallup and Harris knew that the outcome was never in doubt. We learned that Jews, worried about quotas and Israel, would abandon McGovern; that organized labor didn't like him; that factory workers, with George Wallace gone, would go to Nixon; that the waethly wealthy, worried about taxes, would do the same; that the middle class saw safer streets under Nixon; that the ""ethnics"" wanted to crack down on dissenters and deserters and that students could not stick to anything over a prolonged period of time and that almost no single identifiable group could be found — except for Black people — to cast votes as a bloc for

George McGovern.
If the election on November 7th illuminated any political movement at all, it was the movement of the comfortable, the callous and the smug closing their ranks — and closing their hearts — against the claims and calls to conscience put forward by the forgotten and unrepresented elements in American society.
Despite the talk about Eagleton, Watergate, the war, welfare, quotas, bussing, McGovern's shifts on policy and platform, the last minute Kissinger peace initiative, the central issue was clear.
As the Reverend Jesse Louis Jackson has put it, ""It's not the bus — it's us!""
There is something wrong with an election that sees one candidate receiving nearly all of the Black votes cast, and the other candidate receiving more than three-quarters of the white votes cast.
This does not describe a race between Democrats and Republicans, or
3
even between two men named Nixon and McGovern — this was rather a national referendum on what has politely been called ""the social issue"".
For Black people in America, the election results on November 7th signaled consigning nearly all our hopes and dreams to a political oblivion from which they may never emerge. It meant re-installing in power those who believe in privilege for the powerful and neglect of the powerless. It meant giving a four year free hand to the current occupants of Uncle Strom's Cabin, a free hand to men who have demonstrated they have no concern whatsoever for freedom of the press, for the privacy of the individual, or for the constitutionally guaranteed civil rights and liberties we have all begun to believe were taken for granted by those who govern us.
Mr. Nixon now has four more years to put his men on the Supreme Court, to turn it back into the liberal social force it used to be ore to continue its current trend toward repression.
4
He will continue to set the budget and name the directors of the Department of Health, Education and Welfare, the Department of Housing and Urban Development, the Department of Justice and the Federal Bureau of Intimidation.
He will continue to decide whether stocks go up or down, whether money is loose or tight, whether our weekly paychecks buy more or less, or whether they buy anything at all.
He has got now, in fact, four years in which to shape America to his mold, to recruit from the frightened a constituency against the forgotten, to shape his new majority into a force that will continue to rule through fear and division.
A short while ago, the National Urban Coalition tried to spell out what was wrong in this country, and how it could be set right.
""America's malaise,"" they said, ""—which all of us feel in one way or another — has its roots in the distance between national ideal
and national
5
and national reality.""
Our ideal is a country where every American gets an equal chance to perform, where jobs exist for everyone who wants one, where health care and personal safety are assured, where we live in harmony with each other and have a decent place to live.""
""Our reality needs no full recital here. We know that cities are in trouble, that poverty continues in the midst of wealth, that unemployment is high, that malnutrition is widespread, that injustice exists, that tensions endure. In sum, we know that our society is not functioning the way it is supposed to.""
""But if we solve the greatest of our ills,"" the Coalition said, ""our paralysis of spirit and will, we can narrow the distance between what we have and what we want. Indeed, we must marshal our good sense and our good will. There is no sensible alternative.""
In the Coalition view ""America must pursue several major goals
6
between now and the future."" It must try to:
""Achieve full employment with a high level of economic growth — all of our other policy goals depend upon it.
""Provide all citizens with an equal opportunity to participate in American society and in the shaping of governmental decisions affecting their lives.
""Guarantee that no American will go without the basic necessities: food, shelter, health care, a healthy environment, personal safety, and an adequate income.
""Meet our obligations to assist in the economic development of the world's lesser developed nations.
""These are the goals. We can move a long way toward them by 1976.""1
But in addition to the Coalition's major goals, and their definition of ""paralysis of will"" as the greatest of our ills, there is another goal much more desirable. another ill much more horrible. That ill is
7
racism; the goal its containment and eradication.
Everyone knows, or ought to know, that there is one consuming problem that makes life in New York's Harlem, Cleveland's Hough, Los Angeles' Watts, or Atlanta's Vine City or any of America's other urban Atticas — where some men are held in bondage by some other men — both intolerable and insufferable.
That problem is race. It is race that elected our present President in 1968; race that makes some Americans serve and die more readily than others in Vietnam; race that makes some children more educated than others; race that colors all of our lives.
For the past several years, solutions to the problems of race, and therefore to the pathologies of society that spring from it, have been more than abundant.
There are several solutions that, if implemented, would begin to make this country a proper place for men and women to live and work and
8
a healthy place for children to play and grow and learn.
The nation could adopt, and strive for, a policy of full employment.
Equal opportunity, both racially and sexually, can stop being the rhetoric of campaigns and platforms and become the reality of the present.
Through public service employment, increased economic growth, increases in wage minimums and in guaranteeing social insurance by radically altering public assistance, every American can be guaranteed an income.
The institution of a national health insurance program and a radical alteration of federal housing programs will additionally aid in making both urban and rural America more attractive places to live.
Of course, none of these things will ever be done, unless and until there is increased interest among the people who need and want them in replacing the new and no longer silent majority with a noisy and agitated majority movement of the dispossessed who will seek political solutions to their common political problems.
9
For too many young Americans, the possibilty of an exchange of Presidents meant nothing more than an exchange of photographs on the post office wall, or on a dormitory dart board. For Black people, the election was a national referendum on us, of whether we would progress, run in place, or continue to slide backward as we have been doing since 1968.
Since Richard Nixon took office in 1968, we have spent billions more on war; over two million more Americans have been added to the ranks of the unemployed; six million more are on ever mounting relief rolls, inflation has reduced our standard of living, and elitist, xsexist and racist practices run rampant, unchecked through public and private American life.
These practices will not be ended by some catyclismic revolution anytime soon — they can be dented, however, by hard work and by concerted political and social action.
10
That has been the history of Black people's lives in America — constant pressure and agitation, with or without allies — aimed at improving our position.
What has happened in the United States since the first Black people set foot here in 1619 is that everything has changed and nothing has changed, particularly for us in the South.
For one, we are no longer slaves. Secondly, we can sit at lunch counters, sit downstairs at movie theatres, ride in the front of buses, register and vote where we once could not.
But in a great many ways, we are constantly discovering that things have either not changed at all, or have become worse.
A quick look at all of the facts and figures that measure how well, or how poorly, a people are doing — the kinds of statistics that measure infant mortality, unemployment, median family income, life expectancy — demonstrates clearly that the average Black American, while better off
tha
11
than his father was, it actually worse off when his statistics are measured against similar ones for white people.
It is as though Black Americans are climbing a molasses mountain in snowshoes, while white people are riding a ski lift to the tope.
It is these depressing figures, and the accompanying pathology which results from them, that causes so much discontent and depression in Black communities today.
The realization is that over the years the diverse strategies of Booker T. Washington and Dr. W. E. B. DuBois and Marcus Garvey and Martin Luther King and Malcom X have not separately improved the material lot of the masses of Black folk.
The separate agitations these philosophies gave birth to — either a return to mother Africa, a struggle in the courts, a nonviolent thrust into the streets, a violent attempt at doing real injury to white America —
12
all these have accustomed many white people to believe that Black people have by now got everything we want, and half of what white folks have, too.
But the problem so often referred to as America's Black problem — in reality a massive white problem — continues. It continues despite wars on poverty and Great Societies and New Frontiers and will continue despite the New Federalism.
The roots of the problem are deep in the fabric of this country, and began with the rape of Africa, the stealing of child from mother, the separation of husband from wife, the destruction of various cultures and religions, the displacement of a whole people from their land and their country.
They involve the basest of prejudices, an economic system that has always believed property was more important than people — the results have been to place and keep Black people at the bottom of the ladder that in this nation is supposed to lead to jobs and homes and education
13
and security.
It has made us the last to be hired and the first to be fired; it has recently, as any reading of Vietnam casualty lists will show, made our young men first in war, last in peace, and seldom in the hearts of our countryemn. It has given Black children an opportunity to attend school for twelve years while receiving only six years of education. It has placed us on relief to where we are called lazy and shiftless while 6,000 white American farmers are paid $25,000 each a year not to work, and while oil millionaires receive an automatic 27-1/2% tax write off every year.
In short, we are in bad shape. The gains made yesterday are vanishing today. The victories won in the wars of 1954 and 1960 are being negated by the winner of the battle of '68 and the rout of '72.
The question remains for the future — will it happen again?
What is happening now happened once before in American history in the
14
years after Reconstruction. In both cases, a President made a cynical deal, not just with the unreconstructed South, but with the national unreconstructed mentality that believed then as it believes now, that the American social agenda must not include those at the bottom of the ladder.
In return for political support, the national government in Washington agreed to let the white South handle its Negroes in its own way.
The promises made then that Black people would be included inth the social and economic life of the nation were repudiated. Instead of fulfilling the dream, then as now:
The liberal crusaders for social justice and democracy became weary and involved in other concerns as Black people and our problems could no longer be considered a purely Southern phenomenon;
The aspirations for and movement of Blacks began to be curtailed not just by organized violence and barbarity and by a series of legal and
15
extra-legal maneuvers designed to make us less than political and economic equals;
The hopes and belief of Black people that racial equality and social justice could be achieved through litigation, legislation, negotiation, occasional direct action and strong alliances with white liberal groups were supplanted by disillusionment, bitterness, and open anger;
The guilt and indignation of Northern supporters of the Southern drive for equality turned into an attitude of first cautious — and now open — racism when the Northern Black man began to take seriously the claims of progress and began to look for visible signs in Northern cities.2
Reversing this recession of political concern ought to be part of your agenda for the remainder of the seventies.
For Black Americans in the future, this will be done through political action.
Politics, as it has existed for us, is changing. Its history is
16
a sorry one, a history of white repression and Black subjugation, of whites proposing and Black disposing. It is a history with only one bright moment, the ten years of Reconstruction, the ten American years when democracy meant as much in Mississippi as it did in Maine, the ten years in which an aggressive national government acted with armed might to protect the civil and political rights of Black political hopefuls.
From the closing of that period of hope just before the beginning of the twentieth century — the century whose problem, Dr. W.E.B. DuBois said, would be ""the problem of the color line"" to this point just past the middle of the twentieth, Black Americans have seen their fortunes ebb and rise and now, ebb again.
They have seen political promises made and broken in Washington. From the days when Frederick Douglass said ""the Republican party is the ship; all else is the sea"" to the days of Franklin Delano Roosevelt, Black people have tried first one, and now the other, national political party.
17
We have been ill served by politicians whem the late Ralph McGill once called ""so grotesque it seems impossible they could have been influential.""
Instead, a new crop of national political leaders has begun the task the white South once believed was theirs alone: deciding on the proper political, educational and economic position for the region's Black people.
These people march backward like an off-key Salvation Army Band, going into the world to convert the saved into s sinners.
This new group was made of some old faces — a President who rose from the dead, a Southern Senator who has belonged to three political parties, and an Attorney General who surely must be the first man to hold his job in recent years who can receive a standing ovation from white Mississippians.
As that first Reconstruction ended with a deal made in a hotel room,
18
this second one ended that way too: a deal made in a hotel in Miami Beach in 1968 that gave the white South veto power over Supreme Court nominees, gave the white South hope that the drive to register Black voters would stop, gave the white South hope that the slow pace of school integration would move even slower, and breathed new life into the national mood of resistance to progress for Black people.
The task of beginning again cannot be done by Black people alone, and certainly cannot be done by people who measure their social relevance by the length of their hair or the trickiness of the handshake.

must have some new dimensions.
The election campaign this year showed that there are those in our community who place pennies above principle, who believe bigness in bankbooks must take priority over the beauty in Blackness.
Those few who urged Black votes for Nixon demonstrate that talent at tap-dancing is no substitute for thinking.
To vote against your own interest as a demonstration that you don't want to be taken for granted only demonstrates that you don't mind simply being taken.
We must assume that most white Americans lack the will, courage and intelligence to voluntarily grant Black Americans independence, and that they must be forced to do it by pressure.
We must also make other assumptions:

That people do not discriminate for the fun of it, but that the function of prejudice is to defend special interests (social, economic,
21
	political and psychological) and that appeals to the fair play of prejudiced people are like prayers said to the wind.
That colonial patterns old patterns will change, and those in power will relinquish power if they are forced to make a clear-cut choice between continuance of the colonial relationship and another clear-cut and highly cherished value — economic gain or civil peace or political stability and majority-based power.
That conflicet and struggle and confrontation are necessary for social change, and
That the rights and lives of real human beings are at stake and these are in the long run neither ballotable or negotiable, that such negotiation, to be meaningful, must take place between equals acting in good faith and the issues are precisely the good faith — if not the good sense — of white Americans.

For white Americans, the question becomes whether they can give up
22
the benefits — economic profit, political power, social status, and psychological rewards — that are derived from the status quo.
Such a movement is beginning to appear among some white youth motivated perhaps by a surfeit of things American and the debasement of what was thought to be good. Americans today see their cities made unlivable; they see meaningless hard work done by many for the benefit of a few; they see themselves channeled by parents, schools, and draft boards; their passions and skills cannot find an outlet in present-day society. The question for their future is whether they can be counted upon to discontinue the American tradition of racial arrogance.
But for white people in general, those presently satisfied with life as it is, but yearning — with all evident sincerity — to do something to alleviate the Black condition, there is a program as well, spelled out by Frederick Douglass in 1894:
""Now what the real problem is, we all ought to know. It is not a
23
Negro problem, but in every sense a national problem. It involves the question of whether or not after all their boasted civilization, their Declaration of Independence, their matchless Constitution, their sublime Christianity, their wise statesmanship, whether they as a people possess virtue enough to solve their problem.
But how can their problem be solved? Let the white people of the North and South conquer their prejudices. Let them give up the idea that to degrade the colored man is to elevate the white man. Let them cease putting new wine into old bottles, or mending old garments with new cloth. Let them cultivate kindness and humanity . . . .
They are not required to do much. They are only required to undo the evil they have done, in order to solve their problem . . . .
Put away your race prejudice. Banish the idea that one class must rule over another. Recognize the fact that the rights of the humblest of citizens are as worthy of recognition as the rights of the highest, and
24
your problem will be solved and — whatever may be in store for you in the future, whether prosperity or adversity, whether you have foes without or foes within, whether there shall be peace or war — based on the eternal principles of truth, justice and humanity, with no class having cause for complaint or grievance, your republic will stand and flourish forever.""

Now that the nations voters — at least, 54% of them those eligible — have gone to the polls and expressed their choice, we have an opportunity to reflect on why that choice was made, what it meant, and what it will mean in the years ahead.
No discussion of
The choice, simply put, was between the past performance of one fallible man and the unproved promises of another.
Those who believed Gallup and Harris knew that the outcome was never in doubt. We learned that Jews, worried about quotas and Israel, would abandoned McGovern; that organized labor didn't like him; that factory workers, with George Wallace gone, would go to Nixon; that the wealthy, worried about taxes, would do the same; that the middle class seen saw safer streets under Nixon; that the ""ethnics"" want wanted to crack down on dissenters and deserters and that the students cannot could not stick to anything over a prolonged period of time and that almost no one could be found — except Black people — to cast votes for George McGovern. ] 2
If the election November 7th iluminated any political movement at all it was that the movement of the comfortable, the callous and the smug closed closing their ranks — and closed closing their hearstts — against the claims and calls to conscience put forward by the forgotten and unrepresented elements in American society.
As the Reverend Jesse Louis Jackson has put it, ""It's not the bus — it's us!""
There is something worrong with an election that sees one candidate receiving nearly all of the Black votes cast, and the other candidate rece receiving more than three-quarters of the white votes cast.
This was not a simply race between Democrats and Republicans, or even between two men named Nixon and McGovern — this was rather a national referendum on what has politely been called ""the social issue.""
2
For Black people in America, the election results on November 7th sign signaled consigning nearly all our hopes and dreams to a political ] 3 oblivion from which they may never emerge. It meant re-installing in power those who believe in priviledge for the powerful and neglect of the powerless. It meant giving a four year free hand to the current occupants of Uncle Strom's cabin, a free hand to men who have demonstrated they have no concern what-so-ever for freedom of the press, for the privacy of the individual, or for the constitutionally guaranteed civil rights and liberties we have all begun to believe were taken for granted by those who govern us.

Mr. Nixon now has four more years to put his men on the Supreme Court, four years to turn it back into the liber liberal social force it used to be or to continue its current rend trend toward repression.
He will continue to set the budget and name the directors of the Department of Health Education and Welfare, the Department of Housing and Urban Development, the Department of Justice and the Federal Bureau of Intimidation. ] 4
He will continue to decide whether our weekly paychecks buy more or less, or whether they buy anthing at all.
He has got now, if fact, four years in which to shape America to his mold, to create from to frightened recruit from the frightened a constituency against the forgotten, to shape the new majority into a force that will rule through fear and division.

Of course, none of these things will ever be done, unless and until there is increased interest among the people who need and want them in replacing the new and no longer silent majority with a noisy and agitated movement of the dispossed who will seek political solutions to their political problems. ] 9
For too many young Americans, the exch possibility of an exchange of presidents meant nothing more than an exchange of photographs on the post office wall, or on a dormitro dormitory wall dart board. A great deal of fashionably long hair seems to be camoflauge for red neacks. For Black people, the election was a national referendum on us, of whether we would progress, run in place, or continue to slide backward as we have been doing since 1968.

fundamental constitutionally guaranteed personal liberties we should all like to believe are taken for granted by those who govern us. It, additionally, means an end for the moment to any political chances we may have to improve our condition.
A short while ago, the National Urban Coalition tried to spell out what was wrong in this country, and how it could be set right
""America's malaise,"" they said, ""--which all of us feel in one way or another -- has its roots in the distance between national ideal and national reality.""
""Our ideal is a country where every American gets an equal chance to perform, where jobs exist for everyone who wants one, where health care and personal safety are assured. Where we live in harmony with each other and have a decent place to live."" ] 5
Our reality needs no full recital here. We know that cities are in trouble. That poverty continues in the midst of wealth, that unemployment
4
is high, that malnutrition is widespread, that injustice exists, that tensions endure. In sum, we know that our society is not functioning the way it is supposed to.""
""But if we solve the greatest of our ills."" the Coalition said, ""our paralysis of spirit and will, we can narrow the distance between what we have and what we want. Indeed, we must marshal our good sense and our good will. There is no sensible alternative.""
In the Coalition view ""America must pursue several major goals between now and the future."" It must try to:
Achieve full employment with a high level of economic growth — all of our other policy goals depend upon it.
""Provide all citizens with an equal opportunity to participate in American society and in the shaping of governmental decisions ] 6 affecting their lives.
Guarantee that no American will go without the basic necessities:
5
food, shelter, health care, a healthy environment, personal safety, and an adequate income.
""Meet our obligations to assist in the economic development of the world's lesser developed nations.
""These are the goals. We can move a long way toward them by 1976.""1
[Handwritten line with arrow pointing to paragraphs that follow.]
But in addition to the Coalition's major goals, and their definition of ""paralysis of will"" as the greatest of our ills, there is another goal much more desirable , and another ill much more horrible. That ill is racism. , and the goal its containment and eradication.
Everyone knows, or ought to know, that there is one consuming problem that makes life in New York's Harlem, Cleveland's Hough, Los Angeles' Watts, or Atlanta's Vine City or any of America's other ] 7 urban Atticas — where some men are held in bondage by some other men — both intolerable and insufferable.
6
That problem is race. It is race that elected our present President in 1968; race that makes some Americans serve and die more readily than others in Vietnam; race that makes some children more educated than others; race that colors all of our lives.
For the past several years, abundant solutions to the problems of race, and therefore to the pathologies of society that spring from it, have been more than abundant.
There are several solutions that, if implemented, would begin to make this country a proper place for men and women to live and work and a healthy place for our children to play and grow and learn.
The nation could adopt, and strive for, a policy of full employment.
Equal opportunity, both racially and sexually, can stop being ] 8 the rhetoric of campaigns and platforms and become the reality of the present.
Through public service employment, increased economic growth, increases in wage minimums and in minimum wage coverage, and in guaranteeing

social insurance by radically altering public assistance, every American can be guaranteed an income.
The institution of a national health insurance program and a radical alteration of federal housing programs will additionally aid in making both urban and rural America more attractive places to live.
[Handwritten line with arrow pointing to paragraphs that precede.]
None of these things will be done, however, unless there is increased interest among the people who need & desire them in politics; unless there is a growth in political independence, activism, coalition and organization. between now and November 7, 1972.
This is a drive that must spring from a careful calculation of what is at stake and what the issues happen to be:
For too many Americans, an exchange of Presidents is nothing more than an exchange of photographs on the post office wall or a dormitory dart board; for Black Americans, the issue is whether we progress, run in place, or continue to slide backward as we have been doing since 1968.
[The following is deleted with correction liquid.] Since Richard Nixon took office in 1968, we have spent billions
8
Since Richard Nixon took office in 1968, we have spent billions of dollars more on war; over two 62 million more Americans have been added to the ranks of the unemployed; 2 1/2 6 million more are on ever mounting relief rolls, inflation has reduced our standard of living, and elitist, sexist and racist practice run rampant, unchecked through public and private American life.
We will select a new Congress in 1972 as well. These for the most part must be new men and women, not the tired old faces of the past. It should be a Congress that would reject Nixon's family destruction plan, that would say ""no"" to more war, ""no"" to freezes on wages with no freezes on profits, ""no"" to secret government, and ""no"" to preventive detention and no-knock justice.
Such a transformation can be achieved.
To do so, you must be prepared to confront some serious enemies.

These practices will not be ended by some cataclysmic revolution anytime soon — they can be ended by hard work and by concerted political ] 10action and social action.
That has been the history of Black people's lives in America — constant pressure — with or without allies — aimed at improving our position.
(following pages from page 1 beginning at ""What has happened.…. to .….the end of page 4)
[Typeset changes.]
Julian Bond
What has happened in the United States since the first Black people set foot here in 1619 is that everything has changed and nothing has changed, particularly for us in the South.
For one, we are no longer slaves. Secondly, we can sit at lunch counters, sit downstairs at movie theatres, ride in the front of buses, register and vote where we once could not.
But in a great many ways, we are constantly discovering that things have either not changed at all, or have become much worse.
A quick look at all of the facts and figures that measure how well, or how poorly, a people are doing — the kinds of statistics that measure infant mortality, unemployment, median family income, life ] 11 expectancy — demonstrates clearly that the average Black American, while better off than his father was, is actually worse off when
2
his statistics are measured against similar ones for white people.
It is as though Black Americans are climbing a molasses mountain in snowshoes, while white people are riding a ski lift to the top.
It is these depressing figures, and the accompanying pathology which results from them, that causes so much discontent and depression in Black communities today.
The realization is that over the years the diverse strategies of Booker T. Washington and Dr. W.E.B. DuBois and Marcus Garvey and Martin Luther King and Malcolm X have not separately improved the lot of the masses of Black foldk. But their apparent failure has convinced many Black people that such progress will never occur.
The separate agitations these philosophies gave birth to ] 12 — either a return to Mother Africa, struggle in the courts, a nonviolent thrust into the streets, a violent attempt at doing real injury to
3
white America — all these have accustomed many white people to believe that Black people have by now got everything we want, and half of what white folks have too.
But the problem so often referred to as America's Black problem — in reality a massive white problem — continues. It continues despite wars on poverty and Great Societies and New Frontiers and will continue despite the New Federalism.
The roots of the problem are deep in the fabric of this country, and began with the rape of Africa, the stealing of child from mother, the separation of husband from wife, the destruction of various cultures and religions, the displacement of a whole people from their land and their country.
They involve the basest of prejudices, an economic system that has ] 13 always believed property was more important than people — the results have been to place and keep Black people at the bottom of the ladder
4
that in this nation is supposed to lead to jobs and homes and education and security.
It has made us the last to be hired and the first to be fired; it has recently, as any reading of Vietnam casualty lists will show, made our young men first in war, last in peace, and seldom in the hearts of our countrymen. It has given Black children an opportunity to attend school for twelve years while receiving only six years of education. It has placed us on relief to where we are called lazy and shiftless while 6,000 white American farmers are paid $25,000 each a year not to work, and while oil millionaires receive an automatic 27-1/2% tax write off every year.
In short, we are in bad shape. The gains made yesterday are vanishing today. The victories won in the wars of 1954 and 1960 are ] 14 being negated by the winner of the battle of 1968. '68and the rout of '72.

The question remains for the future — will it happen again? What is happening now happened once before in American history in (on page 17 of current speech from top of page to line on page 18 ending "" . . . . . Northern cities.""

[Typeset changes.]
the years after Reconstruction. In both cases, a President made a cynical deal, not just with the unreconstructed South, but with the National unreconstructed mentality that believed then as it believes now, that the American social agenda must not include those at the bottom of the ladder.
The promises made then that Black people would be included in the social and economic life of the nation were repudiated. Instead of fulfilling the dream, then as now:
The liberal crusaders for social justice and democracy became weary and involved in other concerns as Black people and our problems could no longer be considered a purely Southern phenomenon;
The aspirations for and movement of Blacks began to be curtailed ] 15 by organized violence and barbarity and by a series of legal and extra-legal maneuvers designed to make Black men us less than political and economic equals;
The hopes and belief of Black people that racial equality and
[The following is deleted with correction liquid.] socia
18
social justice could be achieved through litigation, legislation, negotiation, occasional direct action and strong alliances with white liberal groups were supplanted by disillusionment, bitterness, and open anger;
The guilt and indignation of Northern supporters of the Southern drive for equality turned into a attitude of first cautious — and now open — racism when the Northern Black man began to take seriously the claims of progress and began to look for visible signs in Northern cities.2
[A handwritten line is drawn between these two paragraphs.]
We are now through with the two major national conventions that choose the four men, two of whom Black people — and all other Americans — will suffer or prosper under, over the next four years.
In a few weeks we will, hopefully, all go to the polls to choose between these men, and to choose what the future for us will be.

Reversing this recession of political concern ought to be part of your agenda for the remainder of the '70s. ] 16
(begin on page 6 with line beginning: ""You must seriously try... to page 9 line ending ""...progress for Black people.""

If we could get it together, will we once again simply deliver warm Black bodies and Black votes to whomever the Democrats put up, or will we insist that the candidate who gets these votes must deliver jobs and power to us?
That is the basis for the Black agenda in the '70s.
We Black people You must seriously try this the old American method that has proved so successful for other groups. That method is politics, which for us must be neither the art of compromise or the art of the possible, but the art of seeing who gets how much of what from whom.
We You ought to enter into politics without believing that the voteing and the vote voting or politics alone, can free a people who have been held in near chattel slavery for hundreds of years, but believing sincerely that who governs whom does make a difference.
Politics, as it has existed for us, is changing. Its history is
7
is a sorry one, a history of white repression and Black subjugation, of whites proposing and Blacks disposing. It is a history with only one bright moment, the ten years of Reconstruction, the ten American years when democracy meant as much in Mississippi as it did in Maine, the ten years in which an aggressive national government acted with armed might to protect the civil and political rights of Black political hopefuls. ] 17
From the closing of that period of hope just before the beginning of the twentieth century — the century whose problem, Dr. W. E. B. DuBois said, would be ""the problem of the color line"" to this point just past the middle of the twentieth, Black Americans have seen their fortunes ebb and rise and now, ebb again.
They have seen political promises made and broken in Washington. From the days when Frederick Douglass said ""the Republican party is
8
the ship; all else is the sea"" to the days of Franklin Delano Roosevelt, Black people have tried first one, and now the other, national political party.
We have been ill served by politicians who the late Ralph McGill once called ""so grotesque it seems impossible they could have been influential.""
Instead, a new crop of national political leaders has begun the task the white South once believed was theirs alone: deciding on the ] 18 proper political, educational and economic position for the regions's Black people.
These people march backward like an off-key Salvation Army band, going into the world to convert the saved into sinners.
This new group is was made of some old faces — a President who rose from the dead, a Southern Senator who has belonged to three political
9
parties, and as new an Attorney General who surely must be the first man to hold his job in recent years who can receive a standing ovation from white Mississippians.
As that first Reconstruction ended with a deal made in a hotel room, this second one ended that way too: a deal made in a hotel in Miami Beach in 1968 that gave the white South veto power over Supreme Court nominees, gave the white South hope that the drive to register Black voters would stop, gave the white South hope that the slow pace of school integration would move even slower, and breathed new life into ] 19 the national mood of resistance to progress for Black people.
The United States Department of Justice joins hands with Mississippi to halt school integration.
Federal contractors are allowed to receive federal monies with the usual anti-discrimination pledges.
[Typeset changes.]
The task of beginning again cannot be done by Black people alone, and certainly cannot be done by people who think they can smoke America to her knees or who measure their social relevance by the length of their hair or the trickiness of their handshake. College campuses used to be centers for movement and social protest — today, they are havens for the bougaloo, bid whist, and boone's farm.
It is frightening to hear those who hide in to the sometime safety and temporary sanctuary of the college campus call for the election of George Wallace as a means of ""hightening the contradictions"" and thereby hastening the revolution. That's quite fine in infantile campus revolutiory theory, but its Black people's contradictions that are being hastened, not theirs.
It is disturbing when people who could spend their time registering voters or organizing the unorganized spend their time instead arguing the ] 20 relative revisionism of the late Ho Chi Minh.
But Black people will persist.

There is, then, a big job to be begun. It can be done, but it will never be done by people who think they can smoke America to her knees. It will not be done if your major concern is macrobiotic diets, or astrology, or music, or drugs, or boutique radicalism, or the romantic rhetoric of revolution or Boones Farm or Bid Whist, or if shouting ""off the pig"" replaces the hard and dirty work of organizing the dispossessed into an effective force for change.
Remember, if you will, some other words from the past, from the great abolitionist Frederick Douglass, who said:

""But if we solve the greatest of our ills,"" the Coalition said, ""our paralysis of spirit and will, we can narrow the distance between what we have and what we want. Indeed, we must marshal our good sense and our good will. There is no sensible alternative.""
In the Coalition view ""America must pursue several major goals between now and the future."" It must try to:
""Achieve full employment with a high level of economic growth — all of out other policy goals depend upon it.
""Provide all citizens with an equal opportunity to participate in American society and in the shaping of governmental decisions affecting their lives.
""Guarantee that no American will go without the basic necessities:
5
food, shelter, health care, a healthy environment, personal safety, and an adequate income.
""These are the goals. We can move a long way toward them by 1976.""1
But in addition to the Coaliton's major goals, and their definition of ""paralysis of will"" as the greatest of our ills, there is another goal much more desirable and another ill much more horrible. That ill is racism and the goal its containment and eradication.
Everyone knows, or ought to know, that there is one consuming problem that makes life in New York's Harlem, Cleveland's Hough, Los Angeles' Watts, or Atlanta's Vine City or any of America's other urban Atticas — where some men are held in bondage by some other men — both intolerable and insufferable.
6
That problem is race. It is race that elected our present President in 1968; race that make some Americans serve and die more readily than others in Vietnam; race that makes some children more educated than others; race that colors all of our lives.
For the past several years, abundant solutions to the problems of race, and therefore to the pathologies of society that spring from it, have been more than abundant.
There are several solutions that, if implemented, would begin to make this country a proper place for men and women to live and work and a healthy place for our children to play and grow and learn.
The nation could adopt, and strive for, a policy of full employment.
Equal opporuntiy, both racially and sexually, can stop being the rhetoric of campaigns and platforms and become the reality of the present.
Through public service employment, increased economic growth, increases in wage minimums and in minimum wage coverage, and in guaranteeing social insurance by radically altering public assistance, every American
7
social insurance by radically altering public assistance, every American can be guaranteed an income.
The institution of a national health insurance program and a radical alteration of federal housing programs will additionally aid in making both urban and rural America more attractive places to live.
None of these things will be done, however, unless there is increased interest among the people who desire them in politics; unless there is a growth in political activism, coalition and organization between now and November 7, 1972.
This is a drive that must spring from a careful calculation of what is at stake and what the issues happen to be:
For too many Americans, an exchange of Presidents is nothing more than an exchange of photographs on the post office wall or a dormitory dart board; for Black Americans, the issue is whether we progress, run in place, or continue to slide backward as we have been doing since 1968.
Since Richard Nixon took office in 1968, we have spent billions
8
Since Richard Nixon took office in 1968, we have spent billions of dollars more on war; over two million more Americans have been added to the ranks of the unemployed; 2-1/2 million more are on ever mounting relief rolls, inflation has reduced our standard of living, and elitist, sexist and racist practice run rampant, unchecked through public and private American life.
We will select a new Congress in 1972 as well. These for the most part must be new men and women not the tired old faces of the past. It should be a Congress that would reject Nixon's family destruction plan, that would say ""no"" to more war, ""no"" to freezes on wages with no freezes on profits, ""no"" to secret government, and ""no"" to preventive detention and no-knock justice.
Such a transformation can be achieved.
To do so, you must be prepared to confront some serious enemies.""
9
These are not limited to the hooded midnight rider or bigoted Southern sheriff of the past, or his crew cut chamber of commerce contemporary of the present.
They are instead those who will tell you that politics is useless and accomplishes nothing. These are many of the same people who told you in 1968 that George Wallace's election would be a good thing, because it would ""heighten the contradictions"" and therefore ""hasten the revolution.""
That's fine in infantile campus revolutionary theory, but it's Black peoples' contradictions that are being heightened, not theirs.
These are the spiritual descendants of the sameepeople who in Germany in the thirties urged the election of Adolph Hitler for the same reason.
Other enemies are found in our own ranks, clustering around the President like fleas on a dog.

The lesson of the last twelve years of Black struggle ought to
12
give us some useful knowledge for today.
From the days of the early 60's when Black people in the South began began an epic movement that soon spread throughout the land until today in 1972 some profound changes have been won.
From the struggle to sit in front of the bus, to the struggle to sit down at lunch counters, to the struggle to sit in an integrated school room, to the final struggle to stand up in the polling places of the states of the Old Confederacy, these diverse battles have each had something in common.
[The following two paragraphs are duplicated in the manuscript.]
In each, there were fully and clearly defined goals supported by nearly the entire Black community.
In each, there were fully and clearly defined goals supported by nearly the entire Black community.
In each, there was mass participation in the Black community, from bar fly to bourgeosie, from doctor to domestic, from preacher to pimp, from st
13
from student to striver.
Some joined in reluctantly, because it meant breaking the habits and accomodations of a lifetime. Others had — as too many of us have today — vested interest in maintaining the status quo. But when the lunch counters integrated or jobs became available, everyone was there.
But in the sixties, on the picket line, we picketed together, today, more often than not, we picket each other. In the sixties in the movemtn, we shared and raised our own money. Today, we shake each each other down, and rip each other off.
In the sixties, you could demonstrate your commitment through your action; today, you can demonstrate your Blackness through the length of your hair, the trickiness of your handskahe, the cut of you dashiki or the revolutionary romanticism of your rhetoric.
In the sixities, our young people were in the vanguard; today, too many bounce between Bid Whist, the Bougaloo and Boone's Farm.
14
In the sixties, we had great moralistic and charismatic leaders — in the seventies, we tend to have only ourselves.
This change occurred through several factors. We in the South discovered that simply putting a pair of pants with empty pockets on a lunch counter stool was a beautiful — but empty — gesture.
We found that the front or rear location of your bus seat was meaningless if the bus only took you from the feudal economic system of the South to the mechanized high rise poverty of the North.
And even voting could become useless when the choice of candidates was between Tweedledum and Tweedledee.
But the sixties showed that change could occur when there were two connected factors: a united and aggressive Black community and a national will toward progress.
Today's Black community is still aggressive, perhaps a trifle less
15
united, but the national will is gone.
It began to vanish when Blacks in Hough and Watts and Newark and Detroit decided that freedom now meant them too. It began to vanish when aggressive war against brown people in Asia became more mimportant than bringing peace and prosperity to Black people at home.
It vanished when busing stopped being transportation and began to be integration, and when a politics based on fear and hatred of Black people took over the White House.
We helped too. We helped by artificially and arbitrarily dividing ourselves into integrationists and nationalists, into reformers and revolutionaries, into middle class and poor, as through there was more than one way to catch hell for being Black in America.
We are now politically where we were twelve years ago. We are voting more but enjoying it less. Changes were made in the decade of the sixties, but changes were made in the fifties as well.
At
16
At the end of each of those two decades, we found a faltering na national mood, a national administration reluctant to administer to Black needs, a national consciousness increasingly eager to have us — and all our problems — slip from the American scene.
That mood was shattered in the 50's, first in Montgomery with marching feet and then in the 60's in every Southern city at lunch counter stools and bus station seats. Black power became a reality at Southern polling places.
That movement became political, and forced change on one of the political parties, made Black men mayors and congressmen.
It is largely forgotten now. Today's Black youth know more about what happend during Reconstruction than they do about what happened ten years ago.
Now the stage is set for a new beginning.
What is happening now happened once before in American history in
17
the years after Reconstruction. In both cases, a President made a deal, not just with the unreconstructed South, but with the national unreconstructed mentality that belived then as it believes now, that the American social agenda must not include those at the bottom of the ladder.
The promises made then that Black people would be included in the social and economic life of the nation were repudiated. Instead of fulfilling the dream, then as now:
The liberal crusaders for social justice and democracy became weary as Black people and our problems could no longer be considered a purely Southern phenomenon;
The aspirations for and movement of Blacks began to be curtailed by organized violence and barbarity and by a series of legal maneuvers designed to make Black men less than political and economic equals;
The hopes and belief of Black people that racial equality and socia
18
social justice could be achieved through litigation, legislation, negotiation, occasional direct action and strong alliances with white liberal groups were supplanted by disillusionment, bitterness, and open anger;
The guilt and indignation of Northern supporters of the Southern drive for equality turned into an attitude of first cautious — and now open — racism when the Northern Black man began to take seriously the calims of progress and began to look for visible signs in Northern cities.2
We are through with the two major national conventions that choose the four men, two of whom Black people — and all other Americans — will suffer or prosper under, over the next four years.
In a few weeks we will, hopefully, all go to the polls to choose between these men, and to choose what the future for us will be.

Four years ago on October 9, 1968, a candidate frunning for the American Presidency said:
""Those who have had a chance for four years and could not produce peace should not be given another chance.""
His name was Richard Nixon, and his four years are up.

JULIAN BOND
The election approaching on November 7th is of crucial importance to all Americans, but particularly those whose condition is poverty and whose skin is Black. For whomever he happens to be, the next president of the United States will affect all of our lives. He will place his men on the Supreme Court, and will turn it back into the activist liberal force it used to be or will continue it's present trend toward facism. He will name the directors and set the budgets and policies for the Department of Justice, the Department of State, the Departments of Health, Education and Welfare and for the Federal Bureau of Investigation. He will decide whether the American agression against the innocent people of Southwest Asia continues, and will decide whether the American troops there now come home marching upright or lying down in pine boxes. He will decide whether stocks go up or down; whether money is loose or tight, whether our weekly paychecks buy more or less or whether we have any paychecks at all. This election will decide whether we will have the politics of wealth and stealth or the politics of compassion and openess.
ButIif the recent public opinion polls are true, they demonstrate the frightening reality that the comfortable, the callous and the smug have closed ranks -- and closed their hearts -- against the claims and call to conscience put forward by the forgotten and unrepresented in our society. For Black Americans, an electoral victory in November for the present occupants of Uncle Strom's cabin will mean consigning nearly all our hopes and dreams
2
to an oblivion from which they may never emerge. It means re-installing in power those who believe in privilege for the powerful and neglect of the powerless. It means giving a four-year free-hand to men who have demonstrated they have no concern for freedom of the press, for the privacy of the individual, or the fundamental Constitutionally guaranteed personal liberties we should all like to believe are taken for granted by those who govern us. It, additionally, means an end for the moment to any political chances we may have to improve our condition.
Earlier last year A short while ago, the National Urban Coalition tried to spell out what was wrong in this country, and how it could be set right.
""America's malaise"" they said, -- ""which all of us feel in a way or another -- has its roots in the distance between national ideal and national reality.""
""Our ideal is a country where every American gets an equal chance to perform, where jobs exist for everyone who wants one, where health care and personal safety are assured, where we live in harmony with each other and have a decent place to live.""
""Our reality needs no full recital here. We know that cities are in trouble, that proverty continues in the midst of wealth, that unemployment is high, that malnutrition is widespread, that injustice exists, that tensions endure. In sum, we know that our society is not functioning the way it is supposed to.""
""But is we solve the grestest of our ills"" the coalition said, ""our paralysis of spirit and will, we can narrow the distance between what we have and what we want. Indeed, we must marshal our good sense and our good
3
will. There is no sensible anlternative.""
In the cCoalition view ""America must pursue several major goals between now and the future. It must try to:
""Achieve full employment with a high level of economic growth — all of our other policy goals depend upon it.
""Provide all citizens with an equal opportunity to participate in American society and in the shaping of governmental decisions affecting their lives.
""Guarantee that no American will go without the basic necessities: food, shelter, health care, a healthy environment, personal safety, and an adequate income.
""Meet our obligations to assist in the ecomonic development of the world's lesser developed nations.
""These are the gaols. We can move a long way toward them by 1976.""1
But in addition to the Coalition's major goals , and their definition of ""Paralysis of Will"" as the greatest of our ills, there is another goal much more desirable and another ill much more horrible. One That ill is racism and the goal its containment and eradication.

The election approaching on November 7 is of crucial importance to Black (all) Americans, but particularly those whose skin is but particularly those whose condition is poverty and whose skin is Black.
For whomever he happens to be, the next president of the United States will affect all of our lives.
He will place his men on the Supreme Court, and will turn it back into the activist liberal force it used to be or will continue its present trend toward facism.
He will name the directors and set the budgets and policies for the Departments of Justice, the Department of State, the Departments of Health, Education and Welfare and for the Federal Bureau of Investigation.
He will decide whether the American agression against the innocent people of South east Asia continues, and will decide whether the American troops there now come home

Earlier this last year, the National Urban Coalition tried to spell out what was wrong in this country, and how it could be set right.
""America's malaise"" they said, -- which all of us feel in one way or another -- has its roots in the distance between national ideal and national reality.""
""Our ideal is a country where every American gets an equal chance to perform, where jobs exist for everyone who wants one, where health care and personal safety are assured, where we live in harmony with each other and have a decent place to live.""
""Our reality needs no full recital here. We know that cities are in trouble, that poverty continues in the midst of wealth, that unemployment is high, that malnutrition is widespread, that injustice exists, that tensions endure. In sum, we know that our society is
2 5
not functioning the way it is supposed to.""
""But if we solve the greatest of our ills"" the Coalition said, ""Our paralysis of spirit and will, we can narrow the distance between what we have and what we want. Indeed, we must marshal our good sense and our good will. There is no sensible alternative.""
In the Coalition view ""America must pursue several major goals between now and 1976 the future. It must try to:
""Achieve full employment with a high level of economic growth — all of our other policy goals depend upon it.
""Provide all citizens with an equal opportunity to participate in American society and in the shaping of governmental decisions affecting their lives.
""Guarantee that no American will go without the basic necessities: food, shelter, health care, a healthy environment, personal safety and an adequate income.
3 6
""Meet our obligations to assist in the economic development of the world's lesser developed nations.
""These are the goals. We can move a long way toward them by 1976."" 1
But in addition to the Coalition's major goals and their definition of ""paralysis of will"" as the greatest of our ills, there is another goal much more desirable and another ill much more horrible. The ill is racism and the goal its containment and eradication.
Everyone knows, or ought to know, that there is one consuming problem that makes life in New York's Harlem, Cleveland's Hough, Los Angeles' Watts or Atlanta's Vine City, or any of America's other Urban Atticas — where some men are held in bondage by some other men — both intolerable and insufferable.
That problem is race. It is race that elected our present President in 1968; race that makes some Americans serve and die more
4 7
readily than others in Vietnam; race that makes some children more educated than others; race that colors all of our lives.
For the past several years solutions to the problem of race, and thus to the pathologies of society that spring from it, have been more than abundant.
There are several solutions that, if implemented, would begin to make this country a proper place for men and women to live and work and a healthy place for our children to play and grow and learn.
The nation can adopt, and strive for, a policy of full employment.
Equal opportunity, both racially and sexually, can stop being the rhetoric of campaigns and platforms and become the reality of the present.
Through public service employment, increased economic growth, increases in wage minimums and in minimum wage coverage, and in guaranteeing social insurance by radically altering public assistance,
5 8
every American can be guaranteed an income.
The institution of a national health insurance program and a radical alteration of federal housing programs will additionally aid in making both urban and rural America more attractive places to live.
None of these things will be done, however, unless there is increased interest among the people who desire them in politics; unless there is a growth in political activism , coalition , and organization between now and November, 1972.
This is a drive that must spring from a careful calculation of what is at stake and what the issues may be are:
For too many Americans, an exchange of Presidents is nothing more than an exchange of photographs on the post office wall or a dormitory dart board; for Black Americans, the issue is whether we progress, run in place, or continue to slide backward as we have been doing since 1968.
9
[Handwritten pages begin here.]
Since Richard Nixon took office in 1968, we have spent billions more on war; over 2 million more Americans have been added to the ranks of the unemployed; 2 1/2 million more are on ever mounting relief rolls, inflation have reduced our standard of living, and elitist, sexist and racist practices run unchecked through public and private America.
We will select a new Congress in 1972 as well. These for the most part must be new men and women, not the tired old faces of the past. It should be a Congress that would reject Nixon's Family Destruction Plan, that would say ""no"" to more war, no to freezes on wages with no freezes on profits, no to secret government, and no to mediocr preventive detention
10
and no-knock justice.
Such a transformation can be achieved.
To do so, you must be prepared to confront some serious enemies.
These are not the hooded midnight rider or bigoted Southern sheriff of the past, or his crew-cut chamber of commerce contemporary of the present.
They are instead those who will tell you that politics is useless and accomplishes nothing. These are many of the same people who told you in 1968 that George Wallace's election would be a good thing, because it would heighten the contradictions and therefore hasten the revolution.
Thats fine in infantile campus revolutionary theory, but its Black peoples contradictions that are being heightened not theirs.
11
These are the spiritual descendants of the same people who in Germany in the 30s, urged the election of Richard Nixon for the Adolph Hitler for the same reason.
Other enemies are found in our own ranks, clustering around the President like fleas on a dog.
I speak here not of those thankfully few but honestly motivated Black Republicans like Senator Edward Brooke of Massachusetts and others around the country who believe in the nearly forgotten tenets of the Grand Old Party.
These men of whom I speak are neither Democrats nor Republicans nor independents, but belong instead to the ""I've got mine"" party, the "" trickle down "" party, the "" take the money and run "" party.
They urge us to vote for the man who gave us
12
Carswell and Haynesworth + ""benign neglect""
Their political allegiances are not tied to party or principal but to pennies, not to devotion to race and pride in self but to devotion to dollars and the race for power; not to the Beauty in Blackness but to the bigness of their bank books.
They praise the president as the greatest savior since Jesus Christ, they applaud the wizard of the wiretap, the architect of law and order, the former attorney general, they attend a formal dinner for the old Dixicrat himself, Strom Thurmond.
And after all that, they have the temerity to go before Black audiences and tell us, "" don't be taken for granted, give the man just
13
one more chance. ""
If one more chance means four more years of the same, I'd rather be taken for granted than just plain taken.
It is a choice of Nixon-nomic and MItchell's mixups, of continuation of criminal war abroad and a war against poor people at home, of benign neglect and mediocre justice, of vetoes of day care centers for the poor and tax dodges for the rich of the unholy coalition of big business, yesterday's South and an 18th Century foreign policy on the one hand, and a candidate and a platform written to support the demands of the underclass, American underclass

The lesson of the last twelve years of Black struggle ought to give us some useful knowledge for today.
From the days of the early '60's when Black people in the South began an epic movement that soon spread throughout the land until today in 1972 some profound changes have been won.
From the struggle to sit in the front of the bus, to the struggle to sit down at lunch counters, to the struggle to sit in in an integrated school room, to the final struggle to stand up in the polling places of the states of the Old Confederacy, these diverse battles have each had something in common.
In each, there were fully and clearly defined goals supported by nearly the entire Black community.
In each, there was mass participation in the Black community, from bar-fly to bourgeosie, from doctor to domestic, from preacher to pimp, from student to striver.
2 15
Some joined in reluctantly, because it meant breaking the habits and accomodations of lifetime. Others had — as too many of us have today — a vested interest in maintaining the status quo. But when the lunch counters integrated or jobs became available, everyone was there.
But in the sixities, on the picket line, we picketed together. Today, more often than not we picket each other. In the sixties in the movement, we shared and raised our own money. Today, we shake each other down.
In the sixites, you could demonstrated your commitment through your action; today, you can demonstrate your Blackness through the length of you hair ,and the trickiness of your handshake. , the cut of your dashiki, or the revot revolutionary romanticism of your rhetoric.
In the sixties, our young people were in the vanguard; today, too many bounce between Bid Whist, the Bougaloo and Boone's Farm.
In the sixtites, we had great moralistic and chairismatic leaders — in the seventies, we tend to have only ourselves.
This change occurred through several factors. We in the South
3 16
discovered that simply putting a pair of pants with empty pockets on a lunch counter stool was a beautiful — but empty — gesture.
We found that the front or rear location of your bus seat was meaningless when the bus only took you from the feudal economic system of the South to mechanized high rise poverty in of the North.
And even voting could baecome useless too when the choice of candidates were was between Tweedledum and Tweedledee.
But the sixities showed that change would occur when there were two connected factors: a united and aggressive Black community and a national will toward progress.
Today's Black community is still aggressive, perhaps a trifle less united, but the national will is gone.
It began to vanish when Blacks in Hough and Watts and Newark and Detroit decided that freedom now meant them too. It began to vanish when aggressive war against brown people in Asia became more important than
4 17
bringing peace and prosperity to Black people at home.
It vanished when busing stopped being transportation and began to be integration, and when a politics based on fear and hatred of Black people took over the White House.
We helped, too. We helped by artificially and arbitrarily dividing ourselves into integrationists and nationalists, into reformers and revolutionaries, into middle class and poor, as though there was more than one way to catch hell for being Black in America.
We are now politically where we were twelve years ago. Insert #1 We are voting more but enjoying it less. Changes were made in the decade of the sixities, but changes were made in the fifties as well.We are voting more, but enjoying it less.
At the end of those two decades, we found a faltering national mood, a national administration reluctant to administer to Black needs, a national consciousness eager to have us — and all our problems — slip from the American scene.
That mood was shattered in the '50s first in Montgomery with marching feet and then in the 60s in every Southern city at lunch stools. and bus station seats. Black power became a reality at Southern polling places.
5 18
That movement became political, and forced change on one of the political parties, made Black men Mayors and Congressmen.
It is largely forgotten now. Today's Black youth know more about what happened during Reconstruction than they do about what happened ten years ago.
Now the stage is set for a new beginning.
What is happening now happened once before in American history in the years after Reconstruction. Insert #2 A In both cases a president made a deal, w not just with the unreconstructed South, but with the national unreconstructed mentality that believed then as it believes no t w now, that the American social agenda must not include those sons of slav at the bottom of the ladder. The promises that Black people would be included in the social and economic life of the nation were repudiated. Instead of fulfilling the dream, then and as now:

The white liberal crusaders for social justice and democracy became weary as Black people could no longer be considered a purely Southern problem;
The aspirations for and movement of Blacks began to be curtailed by organized violence and barbarity and by a series of legal maneuvers designed to make Black men less than political and economic equals:
6 19

The hopes and belief of Black people that racial equality and social justice could be achieved through litigation, legislation, negotiation, occasional direct action and strong alliances with white liberal groups were supplanted by disillusionment, bitterness, and open anger;
The guilt and indignation of Northern supporters of the Southern drive for equality turned into an attitude of cautious — and now open — racism when the Northern Black man began to take seriously the claims of progress and began to look for visible signs in Northern cities.2

We are between through with the two great national conventions that choose the four white men, two of whom Black people — and all other Americans — will suffer or prosper under, over the next four years.
In three months a few weeks we will all go to the polls to choose between these men, and to choose what the future for us will be.
The next President of the United States will have an effect on all"

""What turns me cold in all this experience is the certainty that thousands of innocent victims are in jail today because they had neither money, experience nor friends to help them. The eyes of the world were on our trial despite the desperate effort of the press and radio to suppress the facts and cloud the real issues; the courage and money of friends and of strangers who dared stand for a principle free me; but God only knows how many who were as innocent as I and my colleagues are today in hell. They daily stagger out of prison doors embittered, vengeful, hopeless, ruined. And of this army of the wronged, the proportion of Negroes is frightful. We protect and defend sensational cases where Negroes are involved. But the great mass of arrested or accused Black folk have no defense. There is desperate need . . . to
2
oppose this national racket of railroading to jails and chain gangs the poor, friendless and Black.""*
Dr. DuBois' 1951 observation are twice as true twenty years later; the practice of charging and imprisoning the helpless and dispossessed has continued. The ""army of the wronged"" has increased it ranks to include Angela Davis, Ruchell Magee, Emily Butler, the Soledad Brothers, and now the R N A 11.
The early sixties brought forth vocal protest about the right of people to eat, sleep, ride, read, write and live up to the equality set aside in a Bill of Rights and a Declaration of Independence. Shattering indeed was it for the majority of white Americans to see a movement led by Black men and women determined to change a way of life that deprived brother and sisters of color the right to equality.
Today, young Black Americans are fighting, dying and killing in Asian jungles in a war whose purposes are so ambiguous the whole nation seethes
3
with dissent. From 1960 until today and the war against the people of Indochina we have had thousands of political prisoners. In the early sixties it was the nonviolent protest against discrimination. In the middle sixties it was Black brothers and sisters who proclaimed their pride and Blackness. And it was by the end of the sixties and with the beginning of the seventies the brothers and sisters who were being held captive by a system that they sought to change. Repression of thought became the way of life.
Therefore, a national conspiracy began to build to suppress and repress those who wanted to alter the fundamental character of the American relationship between the haves and the have-nots, between rich and poor, between Black and white.
The RNA 11 are victims of that conspiracy. Eleven people representing a departure from the traditional American Black pattern of protest and politics, they have found themselves caught in the crushing maw of the states's judicial machinery.
4
They are, in fact, conspirators, but not the kind of conspirators the state of Mississippi would like to have you believe they are.
Theirs is a conspiracy to feed the hungry, a conspiracy to free American Black people from twentieth century urban slavery, and theirs is a conspiracy that states that man's continued inhumanity to man will bring down the entire human race.
Theirs is a conspiracy against silence, a conspiracy against the empty rhetoric that has boosted Black hopes but not filled Black stomachs over the past decade, a conspiracy against the national tide which in an earlier American era, stifled white and Black radicalism alike.
During the early 1950s the hangman of social protest operating with Cold War troops was McCarthyism. For years it decimated social organizations, throttled free expression, and intimidated into bleak silence not only liberal and radicals but men in high and protected places. A very small band of courageous people fought back, braving ostracism, slander and loss of livelihood. Gradually and painfully,
5
however, the democratic instinct of America was awakened, and the ideological brute force was routed.
However, McCarthyism left a legacy of social paralysis. Fear persisted through succeeding years, and social reform remained inhibited and defensive. A blanket of conformity and intimidation conditioned young and old to exalt mediocrity and convention. Criticism of the social order was still imbued with implication of treason. The war in Korea was unpopular, but it was never subject to the searching criticisms and mass demonstrations that currently characterize opposition to the war in Southeast Asia.
The blanket of fear was lifted by Black youth. When they took their struggle to the streets, a new spirit of resistance was born. Inspired by the boldness and ingenuity of Black people, white youth stirred into action and formed an alliance that aroused the conscience of the nation.
Today, we find increasingly parallels to the 1950 McCarthy period.
6
The people must not be silent. Our voices must be heard. Those who cry for peace in Vietnam must see also the victims of the war at home. We cannot be totally free until all political prisoners are free, even if we being all the troops home from Southeast Asia.
Thus we must see repression clearly. We in the South particularly if we are Black or low income, have witnessed some of the most degrading forms of repression.
Black people have been slaves for 300 years for the rich white landowner. This repression has continued in even the right to chose your government, and still exists in forms of daily intimidation that Black and poor people face when they attempt to vote.
Repression is not an accident. Repression threatens all Americans. The government punishes welfare mothers, but allows welfare millionaires to stay rich and not grow food while there is widespread hunger. There are 15 million hungry Americans and 6 million jobless Americans. This is
7
repression. The government approves white racist rule of the schools and dehumanizing systems of education. This is repression.
The setting up of massive snooping machinery, the concocting of phony conspiracy trials, the illegal no-knocks and the imprisonment of revolutionary brothers and sisters are but hints of what is to come if we do not speak out.
The government and the military disrespect the will of the people by conducting a secret, criminal, racist war and drafting our young men for death. Repression is not an accident; it is not isolated. And it is not long, if we remain silent and go about business as usual, before we too are behind bars, and facing death.
If we do not succeed in stirring up those who say they are our allies now, it will result in not just death for the RNA 11, but in a critical loss of freedom and life for us all.
It is our task to awaken our brothers and sisters and tell the world of the RNA 11 and that their freedom will hasten the freedom of
8
other innocent victims of political and racist repression, whether they be Black, Chicano, Puerto Rican, or whites who have fought for justice and aroused the anger of those in power.
America has tried to close us out and kill us. Over the past three centuries we have been robbed of our dignity and our manhood. While our women have been raped, our Black brothers have been beaten, castrated, lynched, and hung. We were not only treated as second class citizens, we were treated as less than animals.
We have finally concluded that we are not about to be dehumanized any longer. We see that phrases like ""Black Capitalism"" and ""Black Entrepreneurship"" are bait to make us hate one another. We see that powerful propaganda machines are being used to drive us apart.
But white America's tactics will not work. We are not the carefree, lazy, shiftless folk characterized and caricatured by repressive whites. We are a power of Black people, a community, a people of common interests
9
and common goals. A people of strength.
And we must unite to use that strength to win our struggle for freedom. I believe James Baldwin summed up accurately what could happen if we do not succeed in this struggle. He said in a letter to Angela Davis at San Rafael, ""Only a handful of the millions of people in this vast place are aware of the fate intended for you, Sister Angela, and for George Jackson and for the numberless prisoners in our concentration camps — for that is what they are — a fate which is about to engulf them, too . . . . Knowing this then, we must fight. We must bar the door to the gas chamber with our bodies if necessary. For if they come for Angela in the morning, they will come for us in the evening.""
If they come for the RNA 11 today, they will be here for the rest of us tomorrow.

Thus we must see repression clearly. We in the South particularly if we are Black but also if we are of or low income and or today have long hair have witnessed some of the most degrading forms of repression.
6
Black people have been slaves for 300 years for the rich white landowner. This repression has continued in even the right to choose your government and still exists in forms of daily intimidation that Black and poor people face when they still ? even attempt to vote, .in [areas] Iike Humphries County, Mississippi.
Repression is not an accident.
Repression threatens all Americans. The government punishes welfare mothers and allows welfare millionaires to stay rich and not grow food while there is widespread hunger. There are 15 million hungry Americans and 6 million jobless Americans. This is ] 7 repression. The government approves white racist rule of the schools and de-humanizing systems of education. This is repression. [The following sentence is circled.] The setting up of massive snooping machines are but readying for the police state. ? The concocting of phoney conspiracy trials, the illegal no-knocks and the imprisonment of revolutionary brothers and sisters are but simple hints of what is to come, if we do not speak out.
The government and the military disrespect the will of the people by conducting a secret, criminal, racist wasr and drafting our young men into death. No, repression is not an accident; and it is not isolated. And it is not long if we are ? silent and about the business as usual before we too are, too, behind bars and facing death.
7
If we do not succeed in stirring up those who say they are our allies now, it will result in not alone just death for Angela Davis the RNA 11, but a most critical loss of freedom and life for us all.
It is our task to awaken our bothers and sisters and tell the world that Angela Davis is innocent of the RNA 11 and that her their freedom will hasten the freedom of other innocent victims of political and racist repression, whether they be Black, Chicano, Puerto Rican, or whites who have fought for justice and aroused the anger of those in power.
America has tried to close us out and kill us. Over the past three centuries we have been ? hung, lynched, castrated, raped and robbed of our dignity, manhood and sisterwomanhood. We were not only treated as second class citizens, we were treated as animals. We have finally concluded that we are not about to be dehumanized any more. We see clearly that a brother or sister in need means it also is us in need. We see that the phrases such as like Black capitalism and Black entrepreneurship are the bait to begin to make us hate one another. We see the divisive means of a powerful propagandaized divison machine of white America to call us off. But it won't work. We are no longer ? callous, lazy or shiftless as the white man had himself believe. We are a power of beautiful Black color that is a community. His ? polls cannot reflect the brotherhood that we know. His TV cannot reflect a life that doesn't exist. The truth is we as
8
Black people will have to remain revolutionariesy. That change will come through struggle and freedom, through our hard work. ?
Angela Davis knows that it is may be the fate of all Black people to wind up in a cell somewhere, their freedom severely limited. ?
Attorney Howard Moore, her chief counsel, said recently that this knowledge does not depress her, the only thing that would depress her is if people fail to respond and understand that their fight is merely symbolic of what the fate of all of us may very well be. knowledge
I believe James Baldwin summed up accurately what could happen if we do not succeed. He said in a letter to Angela Davis at San Rafael, ""Only a handful of the millions of people in theis vast place are aware  of the fate intended for you, Sister Angela, and for George Jackson and for the numberless prisoners in our concentration camps _ for that is what they are _ a fate which about to engulf them too . . . . knowing this then, we must fight. We must bar the door to the gas chamber with our bodies if necessary. For if they come for Angela in the morning, they will come for us in the evening.""
If they come for the RNA 11 today, they will be here for the rest of us tomorrow."

Growing war in Southeast Asia, with little possibility of an end, has been a fact of American life for the last ten years or more: growing concern about the condition of the non-white peoples of this country — at least on their part — has been the number one item on the domestic priority list of the sixties.
These two frightening facts — the one because it threatens international annihilation, the other because it threatens domestic genocide — color our lives.
Their presence is a reflection of everything else American: the sorry condition of our cities; the dependence of one tenth of our labor force on war spending; the reactionary stance of the United States Congress; the election of ""Law and Order"" candidates;
2
the incredible ] 2 hunger and malnutrition in the richest country on earth.
There is no escaping the duality of these subjects in a country where more money is spent on pet food than on food stamps; where private citizens spend more on tobacco than all government does on education; where airlines and rail lines receive income supplements; where farmers receive welfare payments of $1 billion dollars a year; where the oil industry in the past ten years received government handouts of upwards of 50 billions of dollars and where supplements for the poor are laughed out of Congress; where five percent of the people have 20% of the wealth and 20% of the people have 5% of the wealth. There can be no denial that we are a generation of people who may be without a future; we may be living on the edge of domestic as well as world-wide revolution that may destroy us all.
It cannot be a mistake that the Communist Party of the Soviet ] 3 Union and certain American capitalists make the same analysis of the United States. That analysis suggests that this country has to maintain
3
its present grip on the economies of the underdeveloped nations of the world or we shall have to lower our standard of living. It may be true that consumption will have to be changed in this nation, both in order to redistribute what there is to be consumed and also in order to have something to be consumed, but it is also true that our preserving this economic advantage is done at a prohibitive cost. ""We cannot afford continued imperialism, either financially or spiritually, without the nation ceasing to function as a democratic state.""1
The United States of America makes up 6% of the world's population; each year we consume 60% of the earth's consumable resources. This fact constitutes the only real threat from the undeveloped world. To imagine that the Vietnamese peasants who have been successfully resisting domination of their land from any quarter for several hundred years are ] 4 going to attack Honolulu in concert with the revolutionaries from Cuba is to imagine that the United States constitutes a real threat
4
to all the nations which have expressed a real desire to govern themselves. If we do constitute that threat, then the fear is real: if the fear is real, we had better try to dispel it in a way radically different from the gun-boat diplomacy of the past.
But it is this over-abundance of concern with the revolutionary activity of the rice farmers of Southeast Asia and the cane cutters and tin miners of South America that has taken our attention from the more serious threat from within; this is not the obviously absurd threat that a minority of Black people will somehow overthrow the government of the United States. But the real fear that the age old division of Black and white and rich and poor will become so pronounced that no bringing together will be possible; that the two separate societies so long in existence in this nation will continue indefinitely with one more ] 5 closely resembling the colonizer and the other the colonized.
To suggest that these two problems can be attacked separately
5
is to believe one is not a function of the other; no nation which cares for its people can make agressive war on another; no nation which cares about the individuality of all men could let the people of its own soil exist as some of the people of this nation do.
A superficial solution would suggest that the system functions well, but that it is run now by corrupt men; that representative democracy as we know it can work, but it has somehow gone astray; that people are basically good, but have been lead down the wrong path. If that were true, then we would have a simple task indeed; an army of young people and others toppled one president in 1968; that same army could be is being reconstituted now, we could topple this one and many of his underlings, replace them with decent people, and our new world would be secure. ] 6
But a perfect system ought to work well no matter how imperfect the men in it; radical change in American foreign and domestic policy takes much more than means a reconstitution of the instruments of power as well.
6
The decision making process which decides to build one anti-ballistic missile, costing 11 billion dollars, needs to be reconstituted. For the dollar price paid for that one piece of already obsolete piece of hardware, 400,000 units of low cost housing, 400,000 schoolrooms and or 1300 hospitals could be purchased.
These are not powers vested in the Congress solely, but in the bureaucratic agencies of government that change little from President to President. The assumptions and the men that govern their actions change little from year to year. These must be radically altered if the quality of life in this country is to be altered as well.
Could not the $125,000 which Senator Eastland was paid two years ago for not planting cotton have been better spent in resettling ] 7 dispossessed Black people on that unused land?
Could not the energy which goes into destroying villages thousands of miles away go into building villages here?
We have heard that the 1970 70s and the beginning of the new
7
decade will bring unheralded promise and progress for all Americans; from statesmen and politicians alike, we are told that the next ten years will be the ten years in which the United States truly lives up to its declarations, and the years in which the land of the slave becomes the home of the free.
Now this may very well be so, but the experience of the last ten years doesn't suggest that it will.
This doesn't mean that man is not a perfectable animal, or that he cannot undertake to correct the centuries of wrong heaped upon men and nations by other men and nations; it is to suggest that some learning from past history will have to be absorbed before a real new ] 8 future can be begun.
To be sure, our system of government, representative democracy, has seen massive improvements and reforms since it was first instituted from the days when the right to vote -- and thereby participate in
8
government -- was limited to white, male property owners, we have seen the franchise enlarged to include women and, all too too slowly, even today, Black people.
From the days when rural America was majority America, we have seen the slow and not yet achieved shift to proper representation on a one-man, one vote basis.
But to believe that these reforms have brought true and complete democracy to this country, or that simply granting the right to vote to every citizen makes for a responsible and responsive government is to incredibly overstate the case for us to continue business as usual.
These last ten years have demonstrated time and time again how ] 9 people of the nation, rather than the government of the nation, have had to move to get the action they deserved, expected, needed and were supposed to have by law.
At the beginning of the '60's, four young black men in
9
Greensboro, North Carolina took what ought to be considered the first step in bringing a much abused phrase -- participatory democracy -- to the American political scene. They had been preceded, of course, by the thousands of Black people in Montgomery, Alabama, who, in 1956, voted with their feet against segregated seating in that city's bus lines, but the action of the Greensboro Four mobilized an unwilling nation into action, spurred a generation of young people into the streets, developed a new consciousness in Black communities and set the example for the rising aggressiveness among white students.
From lunch counters to bus seats to voting booths to student confrontations to the 1968 McCarthy campaign to convention demonstrations; these have been the manifestations of citizen involvement on the left ] 10 hand of the spectrum. On the right we have seen the people's politics in the campaign of the Hillbilly Hitler racist populist from Alabama; the growing militance of white firemen and policemen, the reactionary resistance to job equality from white workingmen. In the middle of the spectrum, we
10
have seen the growing consumer awareness of the American housewife; the frustration of the dissapearing small farmer; the new aggressiveness of middle and low income workers.
All of these people differ in their motives and goals. Some are driven by fear and selfishness; others are caught in an economic system never meant for their benefit, but all are caught up in believing with every good reason that government does not care for them or listen to their opinions; taken together, although their political differences argue strongly against their ever being together, they constitute a noisy American majority of people, who, if they acted together, could shake the foundations of the nations.] 11
The problem for those interested in political change achieved through political action is how to get these people to act in concert -- to vote together, let us say, or to march together, or to demonstrate in unison that they seek common solutions to their common problem, the inhumanity and insensitivity of 20th century American life and the domestic brutality
11
which results from a brutal and bankrupt foreign policy.
To suggest that there is an easy answer to the problem of bringing all these together is to constitute a fraud. It will not be done by dismissing blue collar workers as simple racists who vote for George Wallace; a great many voted for Robert Kennedy as well. 4 years ago and George McGovern in 1972.
It will not be done by suggesting that one group, America's Black people, acting alone can bring about its own deliverance; no group of people with our social identification and lack of power can accomplish] 12 that task.
end
It will not be done by engaging in debate of the relative revisionism of Ho Chi Minh while babies starve in the streets, or by suggesting that the security of the campus is the proper place from which to engage in social criticism of people who never see a book from year to year.
It might be done by reminding ourselves of the words of George Wald, a Nobel Laureat in biology, who said:
A
[Typeset changes.]
It could be done by building a new kind of politics in the United States, not new in terms of electronic wizardry or snappy slogans, but new in the sense that it will appeal to the best in men, not their worst. A new politics that puts together — that noisy American majority, a majority tired of war, a majority tired of socialism for the wealthy and capitalism for the poor, a majority tired of lies in high places, a majority ready to trust each other, to escape from demagogues, to demand progressive change in the lives of the American people.
In our region of the country, it will require some real changes to attitude, more than in law.
It may b require the beginning of a "" stop Carter ""  movement, to stop the senseless posturing that occupies too much of the South every four years.
more
[Handwritten line to the end of the page.]
B
It is sadly obvious that the ""New South"" so heralded after the election of new group crop of Southern Governors is, with few exceptions, merely the ""old"" South slicked over. ] 13
Governor Carter's pathetic attempt to bully the National Democratic Party into its quadrennial compliance with the worst elements of the un-Reconstructed South will hopefully fail.
His complaint that Senator McGovern is the ""only candidate who has not promised equal treatment under federal laws for Southern states"" is merely a repetition of the old complaint that the region of racism, reaction and repression is being singled out for special treatment.
No other section of the country denied Black people the right to vote. No other section of the country segregated its schools, public transportation and private businesses by law. No other section of the country had the discredited doctrine of white supremacy written into law, practiced as public policy, and supported from pulpit and governor's mansion.
And no other section of the country has boasted so long and so loudly about its threatened defection from the national Democratic ] 14 party while offering so little support to that party in Presidential contests.
Its national legislators, grown powerful with seniority bestowed on them by denying Black people the franchise, have a miserable record of national party support. The region's governors, elected as ""state"" Democrats, support the policies and platforms of the minority party or of racist fringe candidates with solely regional appeals in general elections.
An important lesson for those who consider themselves Democrats would be the simple arithmatic of the 1964 and 1968 Presidential elections. In those two contests (particularly 1968), if Black voters had not supported the Democratic nominee he wouldn't have received many votes at all. 7 out of every 10 votes Hubert Humphrey got in 1968 in Georgia were Black; this
C
slavish allegiance to the party of Kennedy may end if the party becomes victim to the special pleadings of the ""New"" South.
Black voters nationally provided the Democratic party with 20% of its vote in 1968; this figure will decrease as well if the candidates and leaders of the Democratic party fall for the sophisticated racism of the current crop of Southern apologists.

Of prime interest to all the Black delegates but especially the Southerners who will assemble in Miaiami in July to choose a Democratic nominee will be any attempt at weakening the 1965 Voting Rights Act.
While no one objects to making the act cover the entire United States, there can be no compromise whatever on Section 5 of that Act. Section 5 requires that any changes by the states or their sudb-divisions in their voting qualifications or procedures be reviewed and approved by the United States Attorney General.
One could imagine doing away with the Act entirely if the South had changed overnight into a region eager to grant Black citizens equal access to the franchise, but sadly this is not the case; in Georgia alone, there n have been more than 20 complaints of voter discrimination and voter harrassment lodged with the Voter Education Project in half again as many months. It is the Voting Rights Act alone which is responsible for any moderation in Southern politics; it is responsible for the election of ever 800 Black elected officials in the 13 11 Southern States.
But Southern politics must change a great deal more, if the behavior of some of our Democratic candidates from for the United States is any indication. These men have wrapped themselves in George Wallace's bloody shirt, and have managed to make themselves an indistinguishable mass to the average Georgia voter.
E
Their They — and our governor —  represent a politics whose threat is the same every election year: listen to us, or we'll take a walk on election year day. The party does listen — in fact it listens in fear — but on election day, these men are no where to be found.
They are eiether indulging in Wallace-mania or Nixon-nomia or are off in some European country that nore closely fits their politics, like Fascist Spain.
The lesson for the National Democratic Party ought to be clear — go fishing where the votes are.
Those votes are naturally found among Black people, but are to be found as well among the working people of this region, people who want school housse not school-room dopror standers, who want jobs with dignity, not welfare paymen payments for bankrupt companies, who want an education for their children, not endless debates about bussing or school boycotts supported by their governor, who want welfare paigd to people who cannot work, bot to peanut and cotton farmers who will not work, who want a real war founght on poverty, and not napalm dropped on innocent children, men and women caught up in a civil war much like ours.
The votes are there. The urge toward decency is there. It can ] 18 all be collected in Nocemner by the candidate and the party who will listen to some words spoken three years ago by George Wald, a Noble Laureat at Harvard University.
He said:

""About two million years ago, man appeared. He has become the dominant species on the earth. All other things, animal and plant, live by his sufferance. He is the custodian of life on earth, and in the solar system. It's a big responsibility.
""The thought that we're in competition with Russians and Chinese is all a mistake and trivial. We are one species, with a world to win. There's life all over this universe, but the only life on the solar system is on earth, and in the whole universe we are the only men.
Our business is with life, not death. Our challenge is to give what account we can on what becomes of life in the solar system, this corner of the universe that is our home: and most of all, what becomes of men -- all men, of all nations, colors and creeds. This has ] 19 become one world, a world for all men. It is only such a world that can now offer us life, and the chance to go on.""2"

One cannot discuss what life has been was like in the sixties or what it may will be like in the seventies without discussing what appear to be two continuing factors in American life--race and war.

The United States of America makes up 6% of the world’s population; each year we consume 60% of the earth’s consumable resources.

All of these people differ in their motives and goals. Some are driven by fear and selfishness; others are caught in an economic
8
system never meant for their benefit, but all are caught up in believing with every good reason that government does not care for them or listen to their opinions; taken together, although their political differences argue against their ever being together, they constitute a noisy American majority of people, who, if they acted together, could shake the foundations of the nation.
The problem for those interested in political change achieved through political action is how to get these people to act in concert—to vote together, let us say, or to march together, or to demonstrate in unison that they seek common solutions to their common problem, the inhumanity of 20th century American life and domestic brutality ] 11 which results from a brutal and bankrupt foreign policy.
To suggest that there is an easy answer to the problem of bringing these together is to constitute a fraud. It will not be done by dismissing blue collar workers as simple racists who vote for George Wallace; a great many voted for Robert Kennedy as well.
It will not be done by suggesting that one group, America’s Black people, acting alone can bring about its own deliverance; no group of people with our social identification and lack of power can accomplish this task.
It will not be done by engaging in debate of the relative
9
revisionism of Ho Chi Minh while babies starve in the streets, or by suggesting that the security of the campus is the proper place from which to engage in social criticism of people who never see a book from year to year.
It might be done by reminding ourselves of the words of George Wald, a Nobel Laureat in Biology, who said:
""About two million years ago, man appeared. He has become the dominant species on earth. All other living things, animal and plant, live by his sufferance. He is the custodian of life on earth, and in the solar system. It’s a big responsibility.
""The thought that we’re in competition with Russians and Chinese is all a mistake and trivial. We are one species, with a world to win. There’s life all over this universe, but the only life on the solar system is on earth, and in the whole universe we are the only men.
“Our business is with life, not death. Our challenge is to give what account we can on what becomes of life in the solar system, this corner of the universe that is our home; and most of all, what becomes of men—all men, of all nations, colors and creeds. This has become one world, a world for all men. It is only such a world that can now offer us life, and the chance to go on.”2"

I have been asked to say a few words about past, present and future roles for Black students in dealing with the multiplicity of afflictions, actual, material, and psychological, that afflict Black people today.
There is, of course, a very real history of student involvement in the concerns of Black Americans.
These concerns have ranged from the integration of lunch counters, busses, bus stations and other public places in the early sixties to voter registration and political activity at the end of the last decade.
But as the community concerns have changed, so has the level of student involvement.
This involvement of students is relatively new in the history of Black agressiveness against white repression.
That agressiveness began when the first Africans came here just before the Mayflower.

Reconstruction
54 decision students were victim-participants instead of initiators.

60 sit-ins

The failure of an individual effort in an isolated county is rural Alabama was not the defeat of a Southwide movement — it was instead, merely the prelude of political victories across the South, the beginning of a drive to seize control of the county courthouse and city hall in towns, cities and hamlets all across this region.
But having control of city hall in Atlanta will not be enough. What is required is something of greater substance.
What is required is setting an agenda for the black the poor and powerless, and the developing the machinery that can deliver it.
[Handwritten line to end of page.]

[Change of typeset.]
an alternative to buring villages in Vietnam; to make busses in Augusta, Georgia, more attractive than bombs into schoolrooms in Laos.
It means doing something which must come as second nature to people who must deal with school boards made up of businessmen and bankers, with legislatures made up of lawyers and farmers, and constituencies made up of angry mothers who want to know not just why Johnny can't read, but why he can't read and has to sit next to Roosevelt Jackson Jones too?
In short, you ought to exercise an old American method for redressing your specific and general grievances with those who run things for you in this country and that method is politics.
There are many things we all need. The most obvious are these:
The nation could adopt, and strive for, a policy of full employment.
The war could end tomorrow.
13 5
Equal opportunity, both racially and sexually, could stop being the rhetoric of campaigns and platforms and become the reality of the present.
Through public service employment, increased economic growth, increases in wage minimums and in minimum wage coverage, and in guaranteeing social insurance, radically altering public assistance, every American can be guaranteed an income.
The institution of a national health insurance program and a radical alteration of federal housing programs will additionally aid in making both urban and rural America more attractive places to live, and will ease the desegregation problems of many school districts.
These solutions are achievable in a variety of ways, not the least of which is building a potent, Black-based left of center political movement in the United States whose aim is changing the name, and the nature, of the current President of the United States.
14 6
For too many people, an exchange of Presidents in this country is nothing more than an exchange of photographs on the post office wall; for Black people, particularly Southern Black people, the issue is whether we progress, run in place, or continue sliding backward as we have been doing since 1968.
The purpose then for which politically minded people must organize now is to influence the selection, nomination and election of a new President, Vice-President and Congress in 1972.
On one level, the choice for the top office is simple; anyone beside Richard Nixon will do.
On another, more sophisticated level, the nominee must be someone who delivers reality and not just rhetoric.
It must be someone who will put teeth into the demands for a decent life.
Since the present President took office, we have spent billions
15 7
more on war, over two million more Americans have been added to the ranks of the unemployed, 2.5 million more are on ever-mounting relief rolls, inflation has reduced our standard of living, many American cities face bankruptcy. The racist policies of public and private U.S. institutions insure that Blacks and other oppressed peoples suffer more than others, in good times and in bad.
The Vice-President's selection is less important, but must be watched as well.
If you vote for a party because the Vice-Presidential candidate is Black, or female, or even Jewish, or even someone who happens to be all three both, we will once again have been taken by a token. While the President lives, the Vice-President can be anyone. They always do what the President says must be done.
A new Congress will be chosen in 1972 also. These must for the most part be new men and women, not the tired old faces of the past.
16 8
It must be a Congress that would reject President Nixon's Family Destruction Plan, that would have said NO to Lockheed, would have said NO to more war, NO to the continuation of starving children eating lead for dinner, NO to freezes on wages with no freezes on profits, NO to Reagan-Feller repression in America's concentration camps, NO to J. Edgar Hoover's Federal Bureau of Intimidation, NO to military millions for Twentieth Century imperialism, NO to Nixonomics and Mitchell's mixups, NO to Rehnquist, NO to the systematic destruction of Black people, our homes, our few jobs, our children, our very lives.
This seemingly magical transformation can be achieved.
It is not too soon to begin now. In fact, it is nearly too late. The process is difficult and easy at the same time. It involves involving yourself in politics, my profession, the second oldest profession in the world.
That should be an easy task for people who help run the schools.
17 9
Politics is not the art of the possible, as you may have been taught in high schools civics, or even the art of the compromise, as you may have learned in Poly Sci 101, but a much more serious art: the art of seeing who gets how much of what from whom.
We, of course, are the who who haven't gotten any of anything from you know who.
There can be no denying then that the direction Black and poor people and their allies must take in the remainder of the 1970s is toward a real and meaningful participation in a new politics.
That is because it is politics that decides, in the end, what kind of life each of us will have, what kind of world we live in, what kind of futures our children will have.
It is politics that sent our sons and brothers and uncles and fathers to Southeast Asia, to shoot and kill and be killed by other mothers' sons in war made by politicians; it is politics that will bring them back alive.
18 10
It is politics that decides that unemployment for Black people will remain at two and three times the national average, and it is politics that decides that we will live in a permanent depressions, and it is politics that can put money in our pockets and give us jobs or a liveable, not laughable, income now.
It is politics that decides that we must live in second and third hand homes that others have discarded or in vertical prisons of concrete and class designed by some architect who lives in the suburbs. It is politics that made it impossible for so many of us to earn a living back home, and ran us into the cities to be squeezed together like sardines in a can, and it is politics that will enable us to take over the cities where we live, and turn them into the kinds of places where everyone wants to live and raise their children.
It is politics that gives our children lead poisoning, and it is politics that has created socialism for Lockheed Aircraft and
19 11
welfare capitalism for the poor.
It is politics in Southern states that made the man who was principal at Booker T. Washington High School last year the assistant to the assistant to the assistant principal at Stonewall Jackson High School this year.
It is politics that made busing acceptable for Black children all over the South until five years ago and unacceptable today.
It is politics which gives tax exemptions to segregation academies.
It is politics that makes us the last to be hired and the first to be fired; that gives our kids twelve years of school but only six years of education; that has made our young men first in war on the battlefield, last in peace, and seldom in the hearts of our countrymen.
But it's how you play your politics that will be most important not just to you, but to Black people all over this country.
Ask the faces who come before you which one is for public housing
20 12
in the suburbs, which one is for busing to achieve quality, integrated education, which one is for nationally guaranteed health care, which one is for minimum income maintainance and guaranteed income, which one is for getting out of Vietnam yesterday, which one is for cutting back on defense spending and for stopping paying farmers not to farm, which one is for welfare reform, which one stands for you?
You and the teachers and even some of the children with whom and for whom you work can begin this year to see that the end of education doesn't have to mean the beginning of unemployment.
Those last words are from candidate Nixon four years ago. In 1972, don't let sweet words or pretty phrases blind you.
You know what your needs are, and what the needs are of the children who come to you. You know they are ill served today, despite your best efforts. You know that a change could come, and you must know that you could help bring it.
I wish you well.

You have a chance to begin this process on Saturday, March 11th, at 11:00 at O'Keefe High School.
You have this chance because you can help elect the people who will help elect the person who may be the next President of the United States.
On Saturday, when the Democrats choose their delegates, you ought to be there.
If you vote in the Presidential election in November of this year, you will choose between two — or three — white, 50-year-old or older men.
On Saturday, you can choose between 95 candidates, white and black, young and old, for 7 slots — 4 delegates and 3 alternates.
Some of these candidates for delegate have presidential candidate's names after theirs.
This does not mean commitment; it means preference.
There are 3 student slates in Saturday's election
One is composed of students from the A. U. Center.
You can help decide what happens Saturday if you care to.
If you do choose to undertake this task, it calls for several obvious decisions notably lacking among college students in the '70s.
You must choose between the romantic rhetoric of revolution and the reality of Black peoples lives. You must choose between whether you measure your commitment by the length of your hair or the intricacy of your handshake or through your day to day service to Black people.
You must choose between whethe you spend several hours a week with people away from these ebony towers or whether you find your solace in Bid Whist and Boone's Farm."

Goals and Recommendations
"" America's malaise "" they said, -- "" which all of us feel in one way or another -- has its roots in the distance between national ideal and national reality. ""
"" Our ideal is a country where every American gets an equal chance to perform, where jobs exist for everyone who wants one, where health care and personal safety are assured, where we live in harmony with each other and have a decent place to live. ""
"" Our reality needs no full recital here. We know that cities are in trouble, that poverty continues in the midst of wealth, that unemployment is high, that malnutrition is widespread, that injustice exists, that tensions endure. In sum, we know that our society is ] 2 not functioning the way it is supposed to. ""
But if we solve the greatest of our ills , "" the Coalition said,  -- ' our paralysis of spirit and will -- we can narrow the distance between what we have and what we want. Indeed, we must marshal our good sense and our good will -- there is no sensible alternative.
 6 2 3
In our view, In the Coalition view, "" America must pursue six five several major goals between now and 1976. It must try to:

"" Achieve full employment with a high level of economic growth -- all of our policy goals depend upon it.
"" Provide all citizens with an equal opportunity to participate in American society and in the shaping of governmental decisions affecting their lives.
"" Guarantee that no American will go without the basic necessities: food, shelter, health care, a healthy environment, personal safety, and an adequate income. ] 3 
"" Rectify the imbalance in revenues between the federal government and state and local government.
Assure adequate national security against military threats from abroad.
"" Meet our obligations to assist in the economic development of the world's lesser developed nations.

"" These are the goals. We can move a long way toward them by 1976. * We recognize that they cannot be reached without three basic requirements: a reordering of budget priorities, increased revenues through a more equitable system of taxation, and a reshaping of government to assure a more responsive and effective delivery of programs and services. But they can and must be achieved. *
Let us briefly examine the validity of each of our goals and explore how they can be met.

Representative Julian Bond
September 16, 1971
Atlanta Hearing on the Urban Crisis
Democratic National Committee
But iIt is nearly useless and certainly redundant in 1971, for any American to tell any other Americans what is wrong with this country, and its cities, and what can be done to set it right.
Everyone knows - or ought to know - that there is one consuming problem that makes life in New York's Harlem, Cleveland's Hough, Los Angeles' Watts or Atlanta's Vine City - or any of America's other ] 4 Atticas - where some men are held in bondage by some other men - both intolerable and insufferable.
That problem is race. It is race that elected our present President in 1968; race that makes housewives ugly in Pontiac; race that makes some Americans serve and die more readily than others in Vietnam; race that makes some children more educated than others; race that is making our cities wastelands.
For the past several years solutions to the problem of race - and thus to the pathologies of society that spring from it - have been more than abundant.
I should like to put forth There are several solutions that, if implemented, would begin to make our cities this country proper places for men and women
2 6
to live and work, and healthy places for our children to play and grow and learn ] 5 
The nation must can adopt, and strive for, a policy of full employment.
Equal opportunity - both racially and sexually - must can stop being the rhetoric of campaigns and platforms and become the reality of the present.
Through public service employment, increased economic growth, increases in wage minimums and in minimum wage coverage, and in guaranteeing social insurance, radically altering public assistance, every American can be guaranteed an income.
The institution of a national health insurance program and a radical alteration of Federal housing programs will additionally aid in making both urban and rural America more attractive places to live.
I have glossed over the these solutions in order to get to the means and of financing them: through different federal budget priorities, ] 6 and a more equitable tax system, and government re-organization.
For example, agricultural subsidies could be cut by $1.2
3 7
billion, while rural residents could be provided with expanded rural non-farm job opportunities.
Federal highway subsidies could be reduced by $1 billion a year, with the funds applied to the more urgent need of mass transit.
Other funds are obtainable by reducing expenditures from the Army Corps of Engineers (currently $1.4 billion) and Merchant Marine subsidies ($330 billion), and most importantly a cut in military spending of $30 billion by immediately withdrawing all advisors and military personnel from all of South East Asia.
Finally, the federal bureaucracy must reform its views and procedures in its dealings with municipalities and suburbs, forcing the latter to shoulder the financial and tax burden now borne exclusively by the former.
Only through a radical shift in priorities, goals, intent and motivation, can the urban crisis be stopped from strangling every American city and from spreading disease and decay further across the land.
8
[Handwritten.]
None of these things will be done unless there is increased interest among us in politics, unless there is a growth in political activism and organization between now and November, 1972.
This is an a drive that must spring from a carful careful calculation of what is at stake and what the issues may be. ] 7
For some of you, it may simply be an exchange of faces dormitory wall on a dart board; for  Black people, it is whether we progress, run in place, or continue sliding backward as we are today have been since 1968.
The purpose for which politically minded people must organize now is to influence the selection, nomination and election of a new president, vice president and congress in 1972
On one level, the choice for the top office is simple — one the simplest level, anyone
9
beside the incumbent will do.
On another, higher level, the nominee must be someone who delivers reality, not rhetoric to the  Black community.
It must be someone who will put teeth into the demands for a decent life.
Since the present president took office, we have spent billions more on war, over 2 million more Americans have been added to the ranks of the unemployed, 2.5 million more are on ever-mounting relief rolls, inflation has reduced our standard of living, most many many American cities face bankruptcy. The racist policies of public and private U.S. institutions insure that  Blacks and other oppressed peoples suffer more than others, in good times and in bad.
The Vice-president's selection is more less important, but must be watched as well. Most importantly,
10
T
it must not be one of the new crop of Southern Dixie governors, these professional white Southerners who are Dixie political nymphomaniacs, satiated only by the ultimate concession to their desires, a return to chattle slavery, a return to the illicit and incestuous relationships the political and personal relationships their ancestors today enjoyed in the past. They hide behind the gratitutous Northern inclination to compare the worst of them to what we had before; they are better than that; but they winning easy congratulations for making statements on race in Georgia that would start a riot in Harlem. ] 9
A new cCongress will be chosen in 1972 also. These must for the most part be new men and women, not the tired old faces of the past. It must be a congress that would have rejected the SSTs, would Family Destruction Plan, would
11
have said no to Lockheed, no to hungry and lead poisoned children, would have said no to more war, no to the Black continuation of starving children eating lead for dinner, no to freezes of on wages with no freezes on profits, to no to Reagan-Feller repression in America's concentration camps, no to J. Edgar Hoover's Federal Bureau of Intimidation, no to military millions for 20th Century imperialism, no to Nixonomics and Mitchell's mixups, no to the systematic destruction of Black people, our homes, our few jobs, our children, our very lives.
This seemingly magical transformation can be achieved, .
7 12
[Typeset.]
and then with these new enfranchisees.
But those people —white, Black, young or old — who will admit — to Playboy or themselves — to being ""very worried"" about race relations and the attendant pathologies that afflict the poor have a role to play as well.
They can join the growing movement to attempt in an organized fashion to build a movement in this country between now and November, 1972, that will not just dis-elect Richard Nixon and several hundred Congressmen, but will also replace them with people who are ""very worried"" about race.
It is not too soon to begin now. In fact, it is nearly too late. The process is difficult and easy at the same time. It involves ] 10 involving yourself in politics, my profession, the second oldest profession in the world.
Your first difficulty will be dealing with those who will tell
8 13
you that politics is useless and accomplishes nothing. These are, incidentally, the same people who in 1968 would have told you that Richard Nixon's election was a good thing, because it would heighten the contradictions and hasten the revolution. That's fine in theory, but it's Black people's contradictions that are being heightened, not theirs. These are the spiritual descendants of the people who in Germany in the 1930s urged the election of Adolph Hitler for the same reason.
Politics is not the art of the possible, as you may have been taught in high school civics , or even the art of the compromise, as you may have learned in Poly. Sci 101 but a much more exciting serious art -- the art of seeing who gets how much of what from whom. ] 11
We, of course, are the who who haven't gotten any of anything from you know who.
Politics is what has decided that some mother's sons have to
8 14
like you.
There can be no denying that the direction Black and poor people must take in the remainder of the 1970s is toward a real and meaningful participation in a new politics.
That is because it is politics that decides — in the end — what kind of life each of us will have, what kind of world we live in, what kind of futures our children will have.
It is politics that sent our sons and brothers and uncles and fathers to Southeast Asia, to shoot and kill and be killed by other mothers' sons in a war made by politicians; it is politics that will bring them back.
It is politics that decides that unemployment for Black people will remain at two and three times the national average, and it is ] 12 politics that decides that we will live in a permanent depression.
9 15
and it is politics that can put money in our pockets and give us jobs or a liveable, not laughable, income now.
It is politics that decides that we must live in second and third hand homes that others have discarded or in verticle vertical prisons of concrete and glass designed by some architect who lives in the suburbs. It is politics that made it impossible for so many of us to earn a living back home, and ran us into the cities to be squeezed together like sardines in a can, and it is politics that will enable us to take over the cities where we live, and turn them into the kinds of places where everyone wants to live and raise their children.
It is politics that gives our children lead poisoning, and it is politics that has created socialism for Lockheed Aircraft and welfare capitalism for the poor. ] 13
It is politics that makes us the last to be hired and the first to be fired; that gives our kids twelve years of school but only
10 16
six years of education; that has made us first in war on the battlefield, but last in peace, and seldom in the hearts of our countrymen.
Finally, it will be politics that decides whether you can get $6,500 a year or $2400; whether mothers of children over six, or over three, are thrown on an already hostile and overcrowded job market or whether they will have the choice their middle-class contemporaries may have: to work if they choose, or stay home and take care of the youngsters, if they choose.
But the kind of politics that has done these things to us is not the kind of politics that we must play; our politics must be different and new.
The kinds of politics that have been played on us must not be played by us. This doesn't mean that we must be soft or say no when we want to say yes; it only means that other people's dirty tricks are not for us.
10 17
If there is anyone who believes it it makes no difference who is President in this country, ask your-self these questions. Who nominated Carswell and Haynesworth to the Supreme Court? ] 14 and put the Minnesota Twins there? Who made John Mitchell the Attorney General of the United States? Whose Department of Injustice allowed tolerates murder to go unpunished at Attica, San Quentin, at Jackson State, at Orangeburg, at Kent State? Who gave the Cinderella Bridegroom from South Carolina, Strom Thurmond, veto power over judicial appointees and school integration decisions? Whose Secretary of Defense says that the war against the Vietnamese people may end but American soldiers will be in Vietnam for many years to come? Who is afraid of the Hillbilly Hitler from Alabama? Who was it who made the gate-mouthed Maryland farmer the Vice President of the Untied States? Who was that man? ] 15
And who were the people who let him do these things? With some exceptions, it was the Congress of the United States, the Representatives whose terms expire every two years, and the Senators whose
11 18
terms expire every six.
You should check yours out. They may be perfect men. It they are not, don't just check them out, kick them out.
In 1968, out of a voting population of 120 million people, only 73 million voted. Richard Nixon received 31 million votes, but half again as many people -- 47 million -- did not vote at all.
It can be done, but it never will be done by people who think they can smoke America to her knees. It will not be done if your major concern is macrobiotic diets, or music, or drugs, or the relative revisionism of the late Ho Chi Minh, or the romantic rhetoric of revolution, or the enobling sacrifice of self-enduced poverty, or if you enjoy Woodstock while you tolerate Watts, or if Boone's Farm, or if Bid Whist, is your major preocupation or if shouting ""off the pig"" replaces the hard and dirty work of organizing the dispossessed into an effective force for change.

Remember, if you will, some other words from the past, from the great abolitionist Frederick Douglass, who said:
""If there is no struggle, there is no progress. Those who profess to favor freedom and yet depreciate agitation are men who want crops without plowing up the ground. They want the rain without thunder and lightning. They want the ocean without the awful roar of her mighty waters. The struggle may be a physical one, and it may be a moral one, or it may be both moral and physical, but there must be a struggle. Power concedes nothing without a demand. It never has, and it never will ......""

The President last year vetoed education expendtures.

""Education ought to be more than a service. It is, after all, the hallmark of any civilization. And it is like the gene which determines future growth.

It is precisely leadership which is failing us now; failing us educationally, failing to rectify the wrongs done Black and poor people in this country, failing to narrow the gap between those who have and those who do not.
Nearly a year ago, the Congressional Black Caucus, the twelve men and one woman who shoulder the political hopes and aspirations of Black America — and one likes to hope, the good wishes of a fair
4
part of white America — presented President Nixon with a list of requests that would, if answered with any elementary decency and compassion, help solve some of the problems which afflict us all.
Under the topic Education, they asked for:

Expansion of child development services
Development rather than custodial programming
Child development services provided as a right
Encouragement of educational innovation and reform
Some consumer control of public education.

To this modest list of rather philosophical requests, they added several legislative suggestions. Those were:

Full funding and full enforcement of the priorities set under Title I of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965;
The abandoning of plans to consolidate federal education
5
	legislation into a program of block grants.
A presidential commitment to universal literacy for every American in this decade:
Greatly increased financial support for predominately Black institutions of higher learning.

None of these are radical, or extraordinary in any way. The President's response was ordinary too, for him, at least. He rejected each proposal and remains to this day callous toward any continuing attempts by anyone to improve or enrich the performance of American public education.
It is callous and cruel indeed to treat such requests lightly, when any list is being drawn of the wrongs in public education, its most visible indices are its effects on the most disadvantaged Americans.

An Urban Coalition study discovered, for example, that ""dropout rates are much higher for minority group youth than for white youth. For example, 42 percent of Negroes in the 16-21 age group were dropouts in 1968, as compared to only 23 percent among whites of this group.
""Additionally, although the median years of education for Negroes now nearly equals the median for whites, the quality of education afforded minority groups is much lower. In his Equality Of Educational Opportunity, sociologist James Coleman found that the median score for white children on achievement tests was 9.7 points higher than that of Negro children in grade one, and 11.1 points higher in Grade 12.2 The schools, one would conclude, are widening rather than lessening disparities.""
""In order to change this situation, innovative programs,
7
expanded funding and institutional reform will be required at all levels from preschool through higher education, including adult education.""3
None of the recommendations of the Black Caucus or of the Urban Coalition are likely to receive a sympathetic hearing in any state house, local school board or in the corridors of the White House unless there is built up in this country a political force powerful enough to make the crisis in the failure of education in America part of the national agenda.
That can only be done by people like most of you, but it will never be done if you convince yourselves that as teachers, or parents of school children, or even as administrators, your only educational concern must be with schooling.
There is a large range of human, and humanistic, life that must
[Typeset changes.]
That is a job for all of us, but particularly for people like yourselves, people who daily see what schools can do, and don't; should do, but won't, and people who see what wasted products production line schools can produce.
This crisis is heightened in 1972, the year in which we choose our ] 8 next president, the year in which we can asses the educational performance of the present occupant of the wWhite hHouse.
I've heard it said that President Richard Nixon is the worst ""anti-education "" President since President James Buchannan, who vetoed the original Land Grant College Act in 1860.
In his Inaugural Message in January, 1969, President Nixon didn't even mention education.
A year later, iIn January, 1970, he vetoed a $4.2 billon dollar appropiation ] 9 for the Office of Education, and then gave a party for the 191 Congressmen who voted to sustain his veto.
That 1970 veto was coincidentially consistent with his earlier actions; — in 1960, as Vice President and Presiding Officer of the United States Senate, he cast a the tie-breaking vote which tabled a General Aid to Education bill.
In his first year in office, heis budget for included no money for school libraries or textbooks; no money for instructional equipment, for guidance or for testing, less than pone-sixth of the authorized amount for handicapped children, only one-fourth of the authorization for bi-linqual education and only 39% of the monies authorized for educationally deprived children.
A year later, iIn January, 1970, he vetoed a $4.2 billon dollar appropiation ] 9 for the Office of Education, and then gave a party for the 191 Congressmen who voted to sustain his veto.
That 1970 veto was coincidentially consistent with his earlier actions; — in 1960, as Vice President and Presiding Officer of the United States Senate, he cast a the tie-breaking vote which tabled a General Aid to Education bill.
In August of 1970, he again vetoed educational appropriations, but this time both the House and Senate overode his veto. Even today, however, about $30 million dollars of this appropriation are still being held up. In the summer of 1970 President Nixon asked for $75 million dollars for assisting district with what were called ""desegregation problems"", or just plain inability to obey the law of the land. Investigative work by Senator Walter Mondale's cCommittee on Equal Educational Opportunity demonstrated that these funds were spent in non-deserving or discriminating districts.
In September, 1971, President Nixon asked the Congress to prohibit the use of federal funds to acheive racial balance. This cynical attempt — just before the opening of the 1971 school year — to play in to the hands of the country's worst obstructionists resulted in untold and unecessary chaos across the country, as white parents bega opposed to integrated schools became convinced they had a friend in the White House.
In December, 1971, President Nixon vetoed the CEO — Child Development Bill which would have given $2 1/2 billion dollars to begin a system of child day care centers for children of from all economic backgrounds, free to the poor, available to others at a sliding scale. The phrasing in his veto message was identical to literature from the John Birch Society which also opposed federally funded day care centers for children. 4
The connection between a president and an administration that enforces inequity, inadequacy and racial frustration and fear on an overburdened public school system and an administration that has enforced repression, curtailment of constitutional guarqntees at home and continuation of criminal war abroad is simple. The one hand washes the other; the minds which devise preventive detention inthe nation's capitol have no sympathy for children detained in in overcrowded classrooms in Harlem, in decaying school buildings in Chicago, in the grip of underpaid and overworked teachers, in tiny county school systems too small to adequatley provedide an educational service.
The resolution of this problem is not simply the replacing of one man with another; it is your becoming a part of a movement to make education a greater priority than war, to make learning ] 12 an alternative to burning villages in Vietnam; to make busses in Augusta, Georgia, more attractive than bombs into schoolrooms in Laos.
It means doing something which must come as second nature to people who must deal with school boards made up of businessmen and bankers, with legislatures made up of lawyers and farmers, and constituencies made up of angry mothers who want to know not just why Johnny can't read, but why he can't read and has to sit next to Roosevelt Jackson Jones too?

[Typeset changes.]
concern the politically minded person in 1972.
All over this country, from now until November of this year, men and women will come and ask for your most precious possession, your vote. It is a possession often bought, or sold, and often freely given, but it ought be bartered more dearly than that.
In short, you ought to exercise and old American method for redressing your specific and general grievances with those who run things for you in this community and this state country, and that method is politics.
There are many things we all need. The most obvious are these:
The nation could adopt, and strive for, a policy of full employment.
The war could end tomorrow.
] 13 Equal opportunity, both racially and sexually, could stop being the rhetoric of campaigns and platforms and become the reality of the present.
8
Through public service employment, increased economic growth, increases in wage minimums and in minimum wage coverage, and in guaranteeing social insurance, radically altering public assistance, every American can be guaranteed an income.
The institution of a national health program and a radical alteration of federal housing programs will additionally aid in making both urban and rural America more attractive places to live. and will ease the desegregation problems of many school districts.
These solutions are achievable in a variety of ways, not the least of which is building a potent, left-of-center political movement in the United States whose aim is changing the name, and the nature of the current President of the United States.
For too many people, an exchange of Presidents in this country is nothing more than an exchange of photographs on the post officae wall; for Black people, particularly Southern Black people, the issue is
9
whether we progress, run in place, or continue sliding backward as we have been doing since 1963.
The purpose then for which politically minded people must organize now is to influence the selection, nomination and election of a new President, Vice-President and Congress in 1972.
On one level, the choice for the top office is simple: anyone beside Richard Nixon will do.
On another, more sophisticated level, the nominee must be someone who delivers reality, and not just rhetoric. to the Black community.
It must be someone who will put teeth into the demands for a decent life.
Since the present President took office, we have spent billions ] 15 more on war, over two million more Americans have been added to the ranks of the unemployed, 2.5 million more are on ever-mounting relief
10
rolls, inflation has reduced our standard of living, many American cities face bankruptcy. The racist policies of public and private U.S. institutions insure that Blacks and other oppressed peoples suffer more than others, in good times and in bad.
The Vice-President's selection is less important, but must be watched as well.
If we you vote for a party because the Vice-Presidential candidate is Black, or female, or even Jewish, or even someone who happens to be all three, we will once again have been taken by a token. While the President lives, the Vice-President can be anyone. They always do what the President says must be done.
A new Congress will be chosen in 1972 also. These must for the most part be new men and women, not the tired old faces of the past. ] 16 It must be a Congress that would reject President Nixon's family destruction plan, that would have said NO to Lockheed, would have said NO to more
11
war, NO to the continuation of starving children eating lead for dinner, NO to the freezes on wages with no freezes on profits, NO to Reagan-Feller resprssion in Americ'a concentration camps, NO to J. Edgar Hoover's Federal Bureau of intimidation, NO to military millions for 20th century imperialism, NO to Nixonomics and Mitchell's mixups, NO to Reinquist, NO to the systematic destruction of Black people, our homes, our few jobs, our children, our very lives.
This seemingly magical transformation can be achieved.
It is not too soon to begin now. In fact, it is nearly too late. The process is difficult and easy at the same time. It involves involving yourself in politics, my profession, the second oldest profession in the world.
The first difficulty of the political activist will be dealing with those who will tell you that politics is useless and accomplishes That should be an easy task for people who help run the schools.
12
nothing. These are, incidentally, the same people who in 1968 would have told you that Richard Nixon's election was a good thing, because it would heighten the contradictions and hasten the revolution. That's fine in imported European theory, but it's Black people's contradictions that are being heightened, not theirs. These are the spiritual descendants of the same people who in Nazi Germany in the 1930s urged the election of Adolph Hitler for the same reason.
Politics is not the art of the possible, as you may have been taught in high school civics, or even the art of the compromise, as you may have learned in Poly Sci 101, but a much more serious art: the art of seeing who gets how much of what from whom.
We, of course, are the who who haven't gotten any of anything from you know who.
There can be no denying then that the direction Black and poor
13
people and their allies must take in the remainder of the 1970s is toward a real and meaningful participation in a new politics.
That is because it is politics that decides, in the end, what kind of life each of us will have, what kind of world we live in, what kind of futures our children will have.
It is politics that sent our sons and brothers and uncles and fathers to Southeast Asia, to shoot and kill and be killed by other mothers' sons in a war made by politicans; it is politics that will bring them back alive.
It is politics that decides that unemployment for Black people will remain at two and three times the national average, and it is politics that decides that we will live in a permanent depression, and it is politics that can put money in our pockets and give us jobs or a liveable, not laughable, income now.
It is politics that decides that we must live in second and third
14
hand homes that others have discarded or in vertical prisons of concrete and glass designed by some architect who lives in the suburbs. It is politics that made it impossible for so many of us to earn a living back home, and ran us into the cities to be squeezed together like sardines in a can, and it is politics that will enable us to take over the cities where we live, and turn them into the kinds of places where everyone wants to live and raise their children.
It is politics that gives our children lead poisoning, and it is politics that has created Socialism for Lockheed Aircraft and ] 19 welfare capitalism for the poor.
It is politics in Southern states that made the man who was principal at Booker T. Washington High School last year the assistant to the assistant to the assistant principal at Stonewall Jackson High School this year.
It is politics that makde bussing acceptable for Black children all over the South until 5 years ago and unnaceptable today.
15
It is politics which gives tax exemptions to segregation academies.
It is politics that makes us the last to be hired and the first to be fired; that gives our kids twelve years of school but only six years of education; that has made our young men first in war on the battlefield, last in peace, and seldom in the hearts of our countrymen.
If there is anyone who believes it makes no difference who is President of this country, ask yourself these questions:
Who nominated Carswell and Haynesworth to the Supreme Court, then who put the Minnesota Twins there? And who now places there a man whose idealogical commitment is to order, not law, to suspicion and repression, not justice.
Who made John Mitchell the Attorney General of the United States?
Whose department of injustice tolerates murder at Attica, San Quentin, at Jackson State, at Orangeburg, at Kent?
17
You should check yours out. They may be perfect men. If they are not, don't just check them out, kick them out.
But it's how you play your politics that will be most important not just to you, but to Black people all over this country.
Ask the faces who come before you which one is for public housing in the suburbs, which one is for bussing to achieve quality, integrated education, which one is for nationally guaranteed health care, which one is for minimum income maintainance and guaranteed income, which one is for getting out of Vietnam yesterday, which one is for cutting back on defense spending and for stopping paying farmers not to farm, which one is for welfare reform, which one stands for you?
The action this year is in the Democratic Party, but we've got to stop being the last group of unrewarded Democrats in the United States.
[Typeset changes.]
You — and the teachers and parents and even some of the children with whom and for whom you work can begin this year to see that the end of education doesn't have to mean the beginning of unemployment.
Those last words are from candidate Nixon four years ago. In 1972, don't let sweet words or pretty phrases blind you.
You know what your needs are, and what the needs are of the children who come to you. You know they are ill served today, despite your best efforts. You know that a change could come, and you must know that you could help bring it.
I wish you well."

The racist policies of public and private U.S. institutions insure that Black and oppressed peoples suffer more than others, in good times and in bad.
The Vice-President's selection is less important, but must be watched as well.
If we vote for a party because the Vice-Presidential candidate is Black, or female, or even Jewish, or even someone who happens to be all three, we will once again have been taken by a token. While the President lives, the Vice-President can be anyone. They always do what the President says must be done.
A new Congress will be chosen in 1972 also. These must for the most part be new men and women, not the tired old faces of the past. It must be a Congress that would reject President Nixon's family destruction plan, that would have said NO to Lockheed, would have said NO to more
11
war, NO to the continuation of starving children eating lead for dinner, NO to freezes on wages with no freezes on profits, NO to Reagan-Feller resprssion in America's concentration camps, NO to J. Edgar Hoover's Federal Bureau of Intimidation, NO to miltary millions for 20th century imperialism,  NO to Nixonomics and Mitchell's mixups, NO to Reinquist, NO to the systematic destruction of Black people, our homes, our few jobs, our children, our very lives.
This seemingly magical transformation can be achieved.
It is not too soon to begin now. In fact, it is nearly too late. The process is difficult and easy at the same time. It involves involving yourself in politics, my profession, the second oldest profession in the world.
The first difficulty of the political activist will be dealing with those who will tell you that politics is useless and accomplishes
12
nothing. These are, incidentally, the same people who in 1968 would have told you that Richard Nixon's election was a good thing, because it would heighten the contradictions and hasten the revolution. That's fine in imported European theory, but it's Black people's contradictions that are being heightened, not theirs. These are the spiritual descendants of the same people who in Nazi Germany in the 1930s urged the election of Adolph Hitler for the same reason.
Politics is not the art of possible, as you may have been taught in high school civics, or even the art of the compromise, as you may have learned in Poly Sci 101, but a much more serious art: the art of seeing who gets how much of what from whom.
We, of course, are the who who haven't gotten any of anything from you know who.
There can be no denying then that the direction Black and poor
13
people and their allies must take in the remainder of the 1970s is toward a real and meaningful participation in a new politics.
That is because it is politics that decides, in the end, what kind of life each of us will have, what kind of world we live in, what kind of futures our children will have.
It is politics that sent our sons and brothers and uncles and fathers to Southeast Asia, to shoot and kill and be killed by other mothers' sons in a war made by politicians; it is politics that will bring them back alive.
It is politics that decides that unemployment for Black people will remain at two and three times the national average, and it is politics that decides that we will live in a permanent depression, and it is politics that can put money in our pockets and give us jobs or a liveable, not laughable, income now.
It is politics that decides that we must live in second and third
14
hand homes that others have discarded or in vertical prisons of concrete and glass designed by some architect who lives in the suburbs. It is politics that made it impossible for so many of us to earn a living back home, and ran us into the cities to be squeezed together like sardines in a can, and it is politics that will enable us to take over the cities where we live, and turn them into the kinds of places where everyone wants to live and raise their children.
It is politics that gives our children lead poisoning, and it is politics that has created socialism for Lockheed Aircraft and welfare capitalism for the poor.
It is politics in Southern states that made the man who was principal at Booker T. Washington High School last year the assistant to the assistant to the assistant principal at Stonewall Jackson High School this year.
15
It is politics which gives tax exemptions to segregation academies.
It is politics that makes us the last to be hired and the first to be fired; that gives our kids twelve years of school but only six years of education; that has made our young men first in war on the battlefield, last in peace, and seldom in the hearts of our countrymen.
If there is anyone who believes it makes no difference who is Presidento f this country, ask yourself these questions:
Who nominated Carswell and Haynesworth to the Supreme Court, then who put the Minnesota twins there? And who now places there a man whose idealogical commitment is to order, not law, to suspicion and repression, not justice.
Who made John Mitchell the Attorney General of the United States?
Whose Department of Injustice tolerates murder at Attica, San Quentin, at Jackson State, at Orangeburg, at Kent?
16
Who gave Strom Thurmond, the Cindaerella Bridegroom from South Carolinea, veto power over judicial appointees and school integration decisions?
Whose Secretary of Defense says that the war against the Vietnamese people may end this moment but American soldiers will be in Vietnam for many years to come?
Who is afraid of the Hillbilly Hitler from Alabama?
Who was it who made the gate-mouthed farmer from Maryland the Vice President of the United States?
Who was that man?
And who were the people who let him do these things? With some exceptions, it was the Congress of the United States, the Representatives who terms expire every two years, and the Senators who terms expire every six years.
17
You should check yours out. They may be perfect men. If they are not, don't just check them out, kick them out.
But it's how you play your politics that will be most important not just to you, but to Black people all over this country.
Ask the faces who come before you which one is for public housing in the suburbs, which one is for bussing to achieve quality, integrated education, which one is for nationally guaranteed health care, which one is for minimum income maintainance and guarenteed income, which one is for getting out of Vietnam yesterday, which one is for cutting back on defense spending and for stopping paying farmers not to farm, which one is for welfare reform, which one stands for you?
The action this year is in the Democratic party, but we've got to stop being the last group of unrewarded Democrats in the United States.
18
In 1968, out of a voting population of 120 million people, only 73 million voted. Richard Nixon received 31 million votes, but half again as many people, 47 million did not vote at all.
It can be done. These figures can be reversed. It means building a strong local base here and now. It means registering the unregistered, organizing the unorganized.
It means building a machine in this town, this county, and this state that can turn out Black voters to demand that the the interests of Black people will be heard and attended to.

""There is very little evidence that anyone in public life cares very much about education. Neither leaders nor parents have made it the number one topic. The president last year vetoed education expenditures. The administration's SST budget request in fiscal 1971 for $290 million was more than the total, combined requests of 1970 for federal aid to state departments of education, impact aid, and aid to handicapped children.
None of the candidates for president of the U.S. has made this a presidential campaign issue.
""The biggest local issue in Los Angeles, in Denver, in Mississippi, in Charlotte-Mecklenburg, in Oklahoma City is busing and how to keep cultural education from occurring. Wherever education is in issue, it is from the negative standpoint — people against busing, or against sex education, or against student unrest.
""Every politician talks about education. Every candidate, it seems, includes property tax reform, or state aid, or federal aid in his top ten priorities for action. But no one makes education number one. It fits along with housing and health care and welfare reform. As if education were a service, it is lumped in with the privileges of citizenship. In last fall's campaigns when student unrest was at issue, education was treated by the vice-president as a reward for good conduct ...""
""Education ought to more than a service. It is, after all, the hallmark of any civilization. And it is like the gene which determines future growth. The ideals and inspiration of the student become those of the leader who translates them into social goals. If education is stagnant, so will be the general leadership which it produces."" 1
Nearly a year ago, the Congressionaly black caucus, the twelve men and one woman who shoulder the political hopes and aspirations of black America — and one likes to hope, the good wishes of a fair part of white America — presented President Nixon with a list of requests that would, if answered with any elementary decency and compassion, help solve some of the problems which afflict us all.
Under the topic Education, they asked for:

Expansion of child development services
Developmental rather than custodial programming
Child development services provided as a right
Encouragement of educational innovation and reform
some consumer control of public education.

2
To this modest list of rather philosophical requests, they added several legislative suggestions. Those were:

Full funding and full enforcement of the priorities set under Title I of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965.
The abandoning of plans to consolidate federal education legislation into a program of block grants.
A Presidential commitment to universal literacy for every American in this decade.
Greatly increased financial support for predominately black institutions of higher learning.

None of these are radical, or extraordinary in any way. The president's response was ordinary too, for him, at least. He rejected each proposal and remains to this day callous toward any continuing attempts by anyone to improve or enrich the performance of American public education.
It is callous and cruel indeed for the president or a local board of education to treat such requests lightly. When any list is being drawn of the wrongs in public education, its most visible indices are its effects on the most disadvantaged Americans.
An urban coalition study discovered, for example, that ""dropout rates are much higher for minority group youth than for white youth. For example, 42 percent of negroes in the 16-21 age group were dropouts in 1968, as compared to only 23 percent among the whites of this group.
""Additionally, although the median years of education for negroes now nearly equals the median for whites, the quality of education afforded minority groups is much lower. In his Equality of Educational Opportunity, sociologist James Coleman found that the median score for white children on achievement tests was 9.7 points higher than that of negro children in grade one, and 11.1 points higher in grade 12.2 The schools, one would conclude, are widening rather than lessening disparities.""
""In order to change this situation, innovative programs, expanded funding and institutional reform will be required at all levels from preschool through higher education, including adult education,""3 the coalition said.
None of the recommendations of the black caucus or of the urban coalition are likely to receive a sympathetic hearing in any state house, local school board or in the corridors of the white house unless there is built up in this country a political force powerful enough to make the crisis in and failure of education in America part of the national agenda.
That can only be done by people like most of you, but it will never be done if you convince yourselves that as teachers, or parents of school children, or even as administrators, your only educational concern must be with schooling or contracts.
There is a large range of human, and humanistic, life that must concern the politically minded person in 1972.
3
All over this country, from now until November of this year, men and women will come and ask for your most precious possession, your vote. It is a possession often bought, or sold, and often freely given, but it ought be bartered more dearly than that.
In short, you ought to exercise an old American method for redressing your specific and general grievances with those who run things for you in this community and this state, and that method is politics.
There are many things we all need. The most obvious are these:
The nation could adopt, and strive for a policy of full employment. The war could end tomorrow.
Equal opportunity, both racially and sexually, could stop being the rhetoric of campaigns and platforms and become the reality of the present.
Through public service employment, increased economic growth, increases in wage minimums and in minimum wage coverage, and in guaranteeing social insurance, radically altering public assistance, every American can be guaranteed an income.
The institution of a national health insurance program and a radical alteration of federal housing programs will additionally aid in making both urban and rural America more attractive places to live.
These solutions are achievable in a variety of ways, not the least of which is building a potent, left-of-center political movement in the United States whose aim is changing the name, and nature, of the current president of the United States.
For too many people, an exchange of presidents in this country is nothing more than an exchange of photographs on the post office wall, for black people, particularly southern black people, the issue is whether we progress, run in place, or continue sliding backward as we have been doing since 1968.
The purpose then for which politically minded people must organize now is to influence the selection, nomination and election of a new president, vice-president, and congress in 1972.
On one level, the choice for the top office is simple; anyone beside Richard Nixon will do.
On another, more sophisticated level, the nominee must be someone who delivers reality not rhetoric to the black and poor communities.
It must be someone who will put teeth into the demands for a decent life.
Since the present president took office, we have spent billions more on war, over two million more Americans have been added to the ranks of the unemployed, 2.5 million more are on ever-mounting relief rolls, inflation has reduced our standard of living, many American cities face bankruptcy. The racist policies of public and private U.S. institutions insure that blacks and other oppressed peoples suffer more than others, in good times and in bad.
The vice-president's selection is less important, but must be watched as well.
If we vote for a party because the vice-presidential candidate is black, or female, or even Jewish, or even someone who happens to be all three, we will once again have been taken by a token. While the president lives, the vice-president
4
can be anyone. They always do what the president says must be done.

NO to the systematic destruction of black people, our homes, our few jobs, our children, our very lives.

You are special here in Decatur.
What is unique, they say about Decatur, Illinois today and Decatur, Georgia, tomorrow and Decatur, Mississippi next year is not only a new militance among teachers, a militance that will spread like a mighty amoeba, but the public eruption of old concerns into concrete political action. A concern like yours, whose issues range from class size and special education to collective bargaining and salary indexes are not peculiar to this town, here, tonight.
They are —or ought to be — universal in this country.
The parallels between the darkest days of the labor movement, the most dangerous days of the struggle in the deep South by Black people for political and civil rights and your struggle here are both apparent and real. The mixture of support from others in the community who have suffered like the Decatur 14 and the opposition of those who enjoy priviledge and prestige and power finds its mirror image in town after town where Black men and women or working men and women struggled and fought and suffered and sacrificed for rightness, for jobs with dignity and fair pay, for better lives and better futures for their children.
The cry of ""outside agitator"" which is always hurled against progressive movements was thrown against you.
The old attempt to divide and conquer which has been tried by every boss in every dispute was tried against you.
The old attempt to paste over human problems with offers of a few coins was tried here.
As your stuggle marched from the schoolroom into the street, so must your concern encompass more than the hours and wages and procedures and methods of your profession.
So it has been with labor; so it has been with Black people; so it must be for you.
You set a standard of agressiveness and an example of highmindedness that is being watched throughout the nation. Your highs and lows, your small defeats and eventual great victory will give added impetus across America, not just to teachers but to countless thousands of others who could choose to lead fairly comfortable, 9 to 5 lives, but who, made uneasy by your commitment will concern themselves with the oppressed, the dispossed, the unrepresented who need voices raised like yours to speak with them.
They, and you, together can begin the building process. They and you together can begin everywhere as you have here, to bring together brother and sister, working-man and work-less man, parent and child in a coalition of people in need of relief and issues in need of resolution.
They and you together, have in Decatur and the other Decaturs around the world — North and South, big and small, — must continue to speak and march and vote and raise funds for this and every other issue that that strikes a chord in the hearts of free men.
When this issue is settled to satisfaction of your concerns, when you have secured justice and decency in this town, don't believe that the battles end means the end of the war.
7
Racism, repression and reaction will rear their heads here again tomorrow, next week, next year.
You have a chance to prove that the Decatur 14, their allies and ideals, can prevail over the Decatur traitors, their lies and threats.
When things go wrong because people don't do right, don't just educate, agitate!

You are a particularly lucky group of people, the Black people of the state of Florida, because you have a chance, on March 14, to have something to say about who the next President of the United States might be.
You must know that on that date this state will hold a presidential primary. You know it because you have seen men and women, members of the United States Congress, the Mayor of the country's biggest city, pay more attention to you than some of them pay to Black people where they live, back home.
You are lucky in another way because Black people in Florida, over the last year, 1971, demonstrated that in some parts of this state you could get it all together, and that you could elect Black people to
2
public office to protect your interests and to represent you.
In a February election in Tallahassee, James R. Ford won a seat on the City Commission, becoming that city's first Black elected official. Also in February, Dr. Joseph Lewis Carwise was elected to the Clearwater City Commission and Holice T. Williams became the first Black elected member of the Pensacola City Council.
Florida's second and third Black mayors, George Gause of Bartow and Neil Butler of Gainesville, were chosen by their fellow City Commissioners in 1971 to serve one year terms, but two other Black candidates for Mayor, Tom Washington of Miami and James E. Huger of Daytona, were unsuccessful in the fall election.
In April, the election of James Jones to the Riviera Beach City Council gave that body a Black majority. John T. Saunders became Hollandale's first Black City Commissioner by winning a run-off election in May. In September, in a city council race in Arcadia, Eugene Hickson
3
was successful in his bid for office and, in November, the Rev. Edward Graham became the second Black elected to the Miami City Commission. (Graham had previously served by appointment to fill the unexpired term of Mrs. Athalie Range, the first Black elected to the Commission, who had resigned to join the staff of Gov. Reuben Askew.
Election activity in Florida in 1971 was climaxed in December by the election of the first predominantly Black local government in Florida since Reconstruction. In Gadsden County, which is 59 percent Black, Black candidates made a clean sweep of a slate for offices open in the town of Gretna. The feat was impressive because, prior to September, no Black people in the county, had been registered to vote. Newly elected Black officials include Earnest Barkley, Jr., Mayor; William Blair and Walter Smith, City Council; and Rosalyn Smith, Clerk. One Black resident quoted by a local newspaper stated ""I've lived in Gretna for 50 years, but this is the first time I've ever felt free.""*
4
But before you can truly say you have it all together, before you can be truly free, before you can have true victories in this county, in this state, in the March presidential primary, you must have some idea of what the issues are for us, some idea of exactly what is at stake.
There is only one problem in this country for us, and that is the problem of race. It is a problem that is tied to every other problem, whether it is war in Southeast Asia, garbage in our streets, no jobs for our men, no good schools for our children.
Some years ago, we were lead to believe that we were a part of what was then called the ""Negro Problem""! We now know that there is not now and never has been any ""Negro"" problem in the United States, but only a very real white problem.
Our problem, this year, is how to escape from it.
Every group from the Black Panther Party to the NAACP has a different
5
solution, but every group agrees on one thing: that is that it is important for us to have something to say about what is being done to us and for us. That is done, in this country, through only one method, and that is politics.
There are many things we need. The most obvious are these:
The nation could adopt, and strive for, a policy of full employment.
The war could end tomorrow.
Equal opportunity, both racially and sexually, can stop being the rhetoric of campaigns and platforms and become the reality of the present.
Through public service employment, increased economic growth, increases in wage minimums and in minimum wage coverage, and in guaranteeing social insurance, radically altering public assistance, every American can be guaranteed an income.

That's fine in imported European theory, but it's Black people's contradictions that are being heightened, not theirs. These are the spiritual
10
descendants of the same people who in Nazi Germany in the 1930s urged the election of Adolph Hitler for the same reason.
Politics is not the art of the possible, as you may have been taught in high school civics, or even the art of the compromise, as you may have learned in Poly Sci 101, but a much more serious art: the art of seeing who gets how much of what from whom.
We, of course, are the who who haven't gotten any of anything from you know who.
There can be no denying then that the direction Black and poor people and their allies must take in the remainder of the 1970s is toward a real and meaningful participation in a new politics.
That is because it is politics that decides, in the end, what kind of life each of us will have, what kind of world we live in, what kind of futures our children will have.
It is politics that sent our sons and brothers and uncles and
fathers
10
[The page number is repeated but the content is continuous.]
fathers to Southeast Asia, to shoot and kill and be killed by other mothers' sons in a war made by politicians; it is politics that will bring them back alive.
It is politics that decides that unemployment for Black people will remain at two and three times the national average, and it is politics that decides that we will live in a permanent depression, and it is politics that can put money in our pockets and give us jobs or a liveable, not laughable, income now.
It is politics that decides that we must live in second and third hand homes that others have discarded or in vertical prisons of concrete and glass designed by some architect who lives in the suburbs. It is politics that made it impossible for so many of us to earn a living back home, and ran us into the cities to be squeezed together like sardines in a can, and it is politics that will enable us to take over the cities
11
where we live, and turn them into the kinds of places where everyone wants to live and raise their children.
It is politics that gives our children lead poisoning, and it is politics that has created socialism for Lockheed Aircraft and welfare capitalism for the poor.
It is politics that made the man who was principal at Booker T. Washington High School last year assistant to the assistant to the assistant principal at Stonewall Jackson High School this year.
It is politics that makes us the last to be hired and the first to be fired; that gives our kids twelve years of school but only six years of education; that has made our young men first in war on the battlefield, last in peace, and seldom in the hearts of our countrymen.
If there is anyone who believes it makes no difference who is President of this country, ask yourself these questions:
12
Who nominated Carswell and Haynesworth to the Supreme Court, then who put the Minnesota Twins there? And who now places there a man whose idealogical commitment is to order, not law, to suspicion and repression, not justice.
Who made John Mitchell the Attorney General of the United States?
Whose Department of Injustice tolerates murder in Attica, San Quentin, at Jackson State, at Orangeburg, at Kent?
Who gave Strom Thurmond, the Cinderaella Bridegroom from South Caroline, veto power over judicial appointees and school integration decisions?
Whose Secretary of Defense says that the war against the Vietnamese people may end this moment but American soldiers will be in Vietnam for many years to come?
Who is afraid of the Hillbilly Hitler from Alabama?
13
Who was it who made the gate-mouthed farmer from Maryland the Vice President of the United States?
Who was that man?
And who were the people who let him do these things? With some exceptions, it was the Congress of the United States, the Representatives who terms expire every two years, and the Senators who terms expire every six years.
You should check yours out. They may be perfect men. It they are not, don't just check them out, kick them out.
But it's how you play your politics that will be most important not just to you, but to Black people all over this country.
Don't be fooled by people who come down here talking slick. Don't cast your vote for someone because he looks good or talks good. What we need is someone who will act good.
14
Ask these faces who come before you which one is for public housing in the suburbs, which one is for bussing to achieve quality, integrated education, which one is for nationally guaranteed health care, which one is for minimum income maintenance and guaranteed income, which one is for getting out of Vietnam yesterday, which one is for cutting back on defense spending and for stopping paying farmers not to farm, which one is for welfare reform, which one stands for you?
If none of these outside faces appeal to you, look around for someone of your own, someone who is here in the state now, and someone who will be here long after the election is over.
The action this year is in the Democratic Party, but we've got to stop being the last group of unrewarded Democrats in the United States.
In 1968, out of a voting population of 120 million people, only 73 million voted. Richard Nixon received 31 million votes, but half again as many people, 47 million did not vote at all.
15
It can be done. These figures can be reversed. It means building a strong local base here and now. It means registering the unregistered, organizing the unorganized.
It means building a machine in this town, this county, and this state that can turn out Black voters to demand the interests of Black people will be heard and attended to.

It is a great pleasure to be in Florida this evening, to speak before a group of people who are interested in political action.
You are are a particularly lucky group of people, the Black people of the state of Florida, because you have the chance, on March 14, to have something to say about who the next President of the United States might be.
You must know that on that date this state will hold a Presidential Primary. You know it because you have seen men and women — members of the United States Congress, the Mayor of the country's biggest city — pay more attention to you than they ordinarily some of them pay to the Black people where they live, back home.
You are lucky in another way because Black people in Florida, over the last year, 1971, demonstrated that in some parts of this state you could get it all together, and that you could elect Black people to ] 2 public office to protect your interests and to represent you.

News Release - 3 December 30, 1971
Florida
Black political participation has brought about solid and historic advances in Florida in 1971, setting the stage for the electoral activity of the presidential primary and national election of 1971.
In a February election in Tallahassie, James R. Ford won a seat on the city commission, thus becoming that city's first black elected official. Also in February, Dr. Joseph Lewis Carwise was elected to the Clearwater City Commission and Hollice T. Williams became the first black elected member of the Pensacola City Council.
Florida's second and third black mayors, George Gause of Bartow and Neil Butler of Gainesville, were chosen by their fellow city commissioners in 1971 to serve one-year terms., butTtwo other black candidates for mayor, Tom Washington of Miami and James E. Huger of Daytona, were unsuccessful in the fall election.actually.
In April, the election of James Jones to the Riviera Beach City Council gave that official body a black majority. John T. Saunders became Haollandale's first black city commissioner by winning a run-off election in May. In a September , in a city council race in Arcadia, Eugene Hickson, Sr., ] 3 was successful in his bid for office and, in November, the Rev. Edward Graham became the second black elected member to serve on the to the Miami City Commission. (Graham had previously served by appointment to fill the unexpired term of Mrs. Althalie Range, the first black elected to the commission, who had resigned to join the staff of Governor Reubin Askew.)
The eElection activity in Florida in 1971 was climaxed in December by the election of the first predominantly black local government in
News Release - 4 December 30, 1971
Florida since Reconstruction. In Gadsen County, which is 59 per cent black, black candidates made a clean sweep of a slate for offices open in the town of Gretna. The feat was impressive because, prior to September, no black people in the county had been registered to vote. Newly elected black officials include Earnest Barkley, Jr., mayor; William Blair and Walter Smith, city council; and Rosalyn Smith, clerk. One black resident quoted by a local newspaper stated, ""I've lived in Gretna for 50 years, but this is the first time I've ever felt free.""1
Georgia
The election of a black majority on the Sandersville City Council highlighted the state's municipal elections of 1971. Cheeve Hooks, P. L. Braswell, and Lindsay Warren, Jr., the winners of the council race, are also the first black elected officials in the history of Sandersville.
In other fall municipal elections, the following black candidates were successful in winning city council seats. Augusta, B. L. Dent (incumbent); Cordele, A. J. Rivers; Cuthbert, Ben T. Shorter; Fitzgerald, George Street; Griffen, Raymond Head; Hiram, Rev. Roy Fitzgerald; La Grange, Glenn Robertson; Lithonia, Allison Venable; and Stone Mountain, Ralph Shipp, Jr. Several winners are the first black councilmen to serve in their municipality.
Also assuming the duties of office in June, 1971, was C. J. Edwards, the first black councilman of Fort Valley. His victory, which had been challenged on the basis of a charter provision which disqualified voters who had not paid taxes, was upheld by a district judge who ruled that a portion of the charter was unconstitutional.

In a special election held in February, Mrs. Dorothy Mae Taylor
But before you can truly say you have it all together, before you can be truly free before you can have true victories in this county, in this state, in the March Presidential Primary, you must have some idea of what the issiues are for us, some idea of exactly what is at stake.
The issue is not how life treats us a women, althouth that is improtant. The issue is not how we are treated
There is only one problem in this country for us, and that is the problem of race. It is a problem that is tied to every other problem, whether it is war in Southeast Asia, garbage in our streets, no jobs for our men, no good schools for our children.
Some years ago, we were lead to believe that we were a part of what was then called the ""Negro Problem!"" We now know that there is not now and never has been any ""Negro"" problem in the United States, but only a very real White Problem.
Our problem, this year, is how to escape from it.
Every group from the Black Panther Party to the NAACP has a different ] 5 solution, but every group agrees on one thsing — that is that it is important for us to have something to say about what is being done to us and for us. That is done — in this country — through only one method, and that is politics.
There are many thinhgs we need — the most obvious are these:
[Handwritten marks lead to the end of the page.]
5
[Typeset changes.]
The nation can could adopt, and strive for, a policy of full employment.
The war could end tomorrow.
Equal opportunity, both racially and sexually, can stop being the trhetoric of campaigns and platforms and become the reality of the present.
Through public service employment, increased economic growth, increases in wage minimums and in minimum wage coverage, and in guaranteeing social insurance, radically altering public assistance, every American can be guaranteed an income. ] 6
The institution of a national health insurance program and a radical alteration of federal housing programs will additionally aid in making both urban and rural America more attractive places to live.
I have glossed over these solutions in order to get to the means of financing them: through different federal budget priorities and a more equitable tax system.
[The following paragraph is handwritten.]
These solutions are achievable in a variety of ways, not the least of which is building a potent, left-of-center political movement in the United States whose aim is changing the name — and nature — of the current President of the United States.
[A handwritten line leads to the end of the page.]
[Typeset begins here.]
For too many people, an exchange of Presidents in this country is nothing more than an exchange of Pre photographs on the post office wall; for Black people, particularly Southern Black people, the issue is whether we progress, run in place, or continue sliding backward as we have been doing since 1968.
[A handwritten line leads to the end of the page.]
7
[Typeset changes.]
For some of you, it may simply be an exchange of faces on a dorm room wall dart board; the post office wall, for Black people, particularly Southern Black people it is whether we progress, run in place, or continue sliding backward as we have been since 1968.
The purpose then for which politically minded people must organize now is to influence the selection, nomination and election of ] 7 a new President, Vice-President and Congress in 1972.
On one level, the choice for the top office is simple: on the simplest level, anyone beside the incumbent Richard Nixon will do.
On another, higher more sophisticated level, the nominee must be someone who delivers reality, not rhetoric to the Black community.
It must be someone who will put teeth into the demands for a decent life.
Since the present President took office, we have spent billions more on war, over two million more Americans have been added to the
8
ranks of the unemployed, 2.5 million more are on ever-mounting relief rolls, inflation has reduced our standard of living, many American cities face bankruptcy. The racist policies of public and private U. S. institutions insure that Blacks and other oppressed peoples suffer more than others, in good times and in bad.
The Vice-President's selection is less important, but must be ] 8 watched as well. Most importantly, it must not be one of the new crop of Dixie Governors, these professional white Southerners who are political nymphomaniacs, satiated only by the ultimate concession to their desires, a return to chattel slavery, a return to the illicit and incestuous political and personal relationships their ancestors enjoyed in the past. They hide behind the gratuitous Northern inclination to compare them to the worst of what we had before; they win easy congratulations for making statements on race in Georgia that would start a riot in Harlem.
[Typeset changes.]
If we vote for a party because the Vice-Presidential candidate is Black, or Female, or even Jewish, or even someone who happens to be all three, we will once again have been taken by a token. While the President lives, the Vice-President can be anyone. They always do wahat the Presidents says must be done.
[A handwritten line leads to the end of the page.]
9
[Typeset changes.]
A new Congress will be chosen in 1972 also. These must for the most part be new men and women, not the tired old faces of the past. It must be a Congress that would reject the President Nixon's family destruction plan, that would have said NO to Lockheed, would have said NO to more war, NO to the continuation of starving children eating lead for dinner, NO to freezes on profits, NO to Reagan-Feller repression in America's concentration camps, NO to J. Edgar Hoover's Federal Bureau of Intimidation, NO to military millions for 20th Century imperialism, NO to Nixonomics and Mitchell's mixups, no to Reinquist ] 9NO to the systematic destruction of Black people, our homes, our few jobs, our children, our very lives.
This seemingly magical transformation can be achieved.
It is not too soon to begin now. In fact, it is nearly too late. The process is difficult and easy at the same time. It involves
10

involving yourself in politics, my profession, the second oldest profession in the world.
YourThe first difficulty of the political activist will be dealing with those who will tell you that politics is useless and accomplishes nothing.

But the kind of politics that has done these things to us is not the kind of politics that we must play; our politics must be different and new.
The kinds of politics that have been played on us must not be played by us. This doesn't mean that we must be soft or say no when we want to say yes; it only means that other people's dirty tricks are not for us.

Now that the nation has changed had a change of leaders and the new set has had a chance to operate for some 22 months, one has had time to consider exactly what will be the attitude of the new faces in Washington toward tired old faces of the poor, the hungry, and the Black.
It does not present a pretty picture.
The long fingers of American might are still sticking in other people's pies. More than 5300,000 American soldiers are still engaged in trying to tell the Vietnamese people what kind of government they can have and under what circumstances.
Here at home, the streets campuses of America have not barely quieted down from last summer semester, and the upcoming ones promises to be just as long and may be just as hot.
2
On the campus, attempts at reform are rebuffed, and attemps at revolution are suppressed. Young people have discovered that our finest universities hold investments in slave mines, or research the best ways to defoliate jungles and people.
All Americans have learned over the past several months years that the machinery that we were told was build to protect us - college deans and their machinery, county sheriffs and their machinery, political parties and their machinery, American Presidents and their machinery - were in fact bent on suppressing those with whom they dealt.
We repudiated in 1968 a potential President of the type who preached peace and practiced war. We elected one who has yet to demonstrate he has concern for the poor and the Black.
For some Americans in 1968 the 1960s, politics failed completely.
3
One potential candidate in 1968 fell victim to an assasin's bullet; another was stilled by parliamentary democracy.
But some lessons didn't have to be learned.
It didn't take a Kerner report for Black people to discover that white people were our problem, and not we theirs.
It didn't take Eugene McCarthy for some Americans to see that war against liberation and people in Southeast Asia was wrong, and it took only a few hours last in August of 1968, in Chicago and Prague, to see that machines will crush liberty wherever it appears.
But overall, 1968 was the Sixties were a learning year decade. Young whites learned .. and are still learning .. their lessons against Trustees and Regents and Deans. Older people learned it against the County Chairman and the Ward Boss. Blacks learned it against white people.
4
The lessons learned were simple. An old Black abolitionist, Frederick Douglass, stated it well when he said: ""Power concedes nothing without a demand; it never has and never will. Find out just what any people will quietly submit to, and you have discovered the exact measure of injustice and wrong which will be imposed upon them, and these will continue until they are resisted with either words, or blows, or both. The limits of tyrants are prescribed by the endurance of those whom they oppress.""
We must continue to fight the battles still to be fought and won. The continuing battle against fascism will be most difficult. The police state tactics which began in the South against Blacks, were tranferred to the campus for use against students, into the streets of Chicago for use against everyone, and which are now being
5
aimed at militant groups like the Panthers must be halted.
The use of the courts and law and order as an instrument of repression can be seen nowhere as cleary as in the persecution of Dr. Spock and the curious case now going that went on in Chicago, in which eight people are were charged with the unlikely offense of conspiring to incite the Chicago Police to riot.
Another struggle which has to be supported is the battle to halt welfare programs for rich people. This must be the only country in the world which runs its economy on capitalism for poor people and socialism for rich people.
We annually spend more money on pet food than we do on food stamps. We pour vast federal subsidies into the oil industry and the cotton industry. We gave gentlemean farmer Senator James O. Eastland $140,000 in farm subsidies, in effect paying him for doing nothing. But no one says that Eastland is lazy, and shiftless and a welfare bum. Some weeks ago. The United States House
6
of Representatives voted recently to place a $20,000 limit on the amount of money a farmer could receive for doing nothing; when will they begin to think about paying $20,000 a year to families, the poor and the Black, who cannot do for themselves?
Black people are seeing a real wave of racism sweeping the country. The recent elections in Los Angeles, Milwaukee and New York across the country have clearly demonstrated that race is not an issue in Southern politics alone, but that it is an issue and will be an issue in every municipal and country and state election for some time in the future. In 1970 This year , there will is be an opportunity to replace some of the worst racists and military merchants in Congress. Some of our larger American cities are turning Black; we will have the opportunity to put decent men in Mayors' Chairs all over this nation, but only if we get ourselves together.
7
There are other attacks being made on us. The federal government and the little tyrant who runs the FBI have given notice they believe they can with impunity listen in on the conversation of anyone in the United States. Just this last summer, they admitted they planted bugs in the telephone, the living room and the automobile of one of our religious leaders, the Honorable Elijah Muhammad. They admitted they bugged the conversation and hotel rooms of the late Dr. Martin Luther, Jr. The next time you call someone, or have a conversation with someone that you think is private, ask yourself whether Attorney General Mitchell and J. Edgar Hoover are listening in.
Over the last few weeks months, we have seen a series of vicious and well coordinated attacks made made by local policemen
8
and the FBI on the Black Panther Party, one of the vanguard organizations in the Black liberation struggle. Their leaders have been arrested, their offices ransacked. You may not care what happens to the Black Panthers, although you should, but if you don't speak out when the Panthers are attacked, ask yourself, who will speak out for you?
And while Senator Thurmond, the the real political Christine Jorgenson Cinderella Bridegroom from South Carolina, continues to subvert school education integration in the South, we must continue to fight that battle as well.
While the President of the United States and the Puppet Dictator of South Vietnam still continue to deny freedom of choice to the people of Southeast Asia, and while this government squanders money on the ABM (America's Biggest Mistake), we must continue to demand that men on earth receive equal treatment with men on the moon, and that there are 25 million poor people here who demand
9
that a war be fought at home, with just as much vigor and money as the war against people in Southeast Asia.
And when serious demands are made by serious people on some of the wealthiest financial institutions in the United States, the religious establishment, we have to fight to win that battle too. Don't let anyone tell you that the money will be used to line someone's pocket; we are demanding reparations to the tune of $15 a nigger, reparations to build a Southern land bank, to build a Black publishing house, to help finance education for Black professionals, for the National Rights Organization. That battle must be fought as well, and when it is won, the American business must face our demands too.
You ought to face up to that demand. It is a right one. It is a just one. It is a proper one. Just remember, if you have any fondness for organized religion in this country, it was
10
the Christian Church that brought my ancestors here in order to civilise them, and when the church came to Africa, we had the land and they had the Bible. Now all we have is the Bible.
Our difficulty is that we have no way to control or influence the several ways in which decision making in this society is ordered; we have little or no access "" power centers "" in America.
The ""power centers"" are several; they include private wealth; the nation's 25 largest corporations (the annual revenues of General Motors are larger than the Gross National Product of all but the fifteen largest nations of the world); the military/industrial/labor complex, which overlaps with the corporations; the federal and state governmental apparatus and organized crime.1
We are denied access to these centers of power precisely
 
11
because when America was being divided and raped, we were not in a position to divide or rape but were instead raped ourselves. Today we lack access to these centers of power because we are too small a group, too geographically dispersed.2
The prospects - or even the desirability of our taking over one or more of these centers of power is slim. We must then prepare to deal with the possibility that only limited advantages are possible for us as a group while we remain tied to white America.
(Separatism, or more properly partition, would might solve some of these problems for us; it is, however, a long range
1w 12
prospect. Planning for it ought not get in the way of whatever limited gains are possible now).
Minimal control of the resources, goods, institutions, services, the regulation of the flow of capital in and out of our community is a must.
What we need is not Black capitalism but a what could more properly called community socialism, so that we may have profit for the many instead of the few, so that neighborhoods and communities shall have the major say in who gets what from whom.
We need to find ways to control what we can. That means our politics as well as our economy. We need to seek out whatever allies are available, brown, yellow, red or Black or white, on whatever issues appeals to us all.
One ray of hope could be offered by our young, those who are
13
 now occassionaly engaged in restructuring the university. There is a task waiting them outside the ivy covered walls of American education. There sit the millions, squeezed into slums, working if they work at all for pennies, being educated, if they are educated at all, to push mops and brooms, waiting and hoping for some salvation.
Of course, some do not wait at all, but are engaged every summer in restructuring the American slum.
But the the young, after winning whatever victory is available on the playing fields of Harvard and Columbia, have a job to do. The job is physical, rather than verbal. The rhetoric heard from the campus and street corner has little meaning to a starving child or an unemployed father. That rhetoric must be made into a reality. If it is not, then we shall reap the whirlwind.
Finally, let us consider what kind of new movement can be built in this country. It is being built now, built by those who
14
were not frightened into inaction by the Meredith march new agressiveness of Black people ; built by those who were told to organize their own, and did so, built by those who felt that both inside and outside the Chicago Convention, nothing was happening, those are building on the ashes of the 1964 drive by Black & white colletge students to build a people's movement, a people's politics in America.
That movement faltered then. But it brought forth some hope. Hope which springs from American history which is not taught in any school. Hope which suggests that a better day might just be possible, if the energy put into building it becomes equal to the energy put into discussing it.
Its possibility makes chilling the prediction of a Black Georgian, who, writing nearly 100 years ago, suggested a kind of struggle that ought to strike fear in the hearts and
15
minds of the kinds of comfortable people who come to hear - and perhaps applaud - speakers like myself.
He wrote in 1884:
"". . . the future struggle in the South will be, not between white man and Black man, but between capital and labor, landlord and tenant. The hour is approaching when the laboring classes of this country, North, East, West, and South, will recognize they have a common cause and a common enemy; and that therefore, if they would triumph over wrong and place the laurel wreath upon triumpahnt justice, without distinction of race or previous condition, they must unite. When the issue is properly joined, the rich, whether they be a Black or white, will be found on one side . . . and the poor, be they Black or be they white, will be found on the other.

Those most commonly used are ""system"" and ""establishment"".
It is supposed, by those who use these terms, that the ""establishment"" may either be very large or very small; may include both Nelson Rockefeller and Whitney Young and in the minds of some, even the late Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.; it may include a few millionaires or the entire American middle class: but it is certainly the group that controls things in the United States, and in fact, much of the rest of the world.
""The system"" is more easily but still loosely defined,
2
however - it is the process that keeps the establishment in power. Questions are raised about the system, however, and whether it serves the establishment because it is flawed and non-functioning, or whether it is purposely designed, by that very same establishment, to do what it does, and is in fact, working perfectly.
That is the subject for another day, however. For the moment, let us consider this vague organization, the establishment, its relationship to white and a great many Black young people and the likelihood or even probability of it becoming either moderately and radically different than it is today.
One may assume that if such an animal exists, we as a people are certainly oppressed by it, and if the establishment depends on capitalism and corporate liberalism and moderate welfare
3
democracy for its existance, then they will have to be attacked also to end our oppression.
The props which support this establishment must be attacked the young say simply because there is no option, given the nature of the oppression emanating from the establishment, in exchanging a white one set of oppressors for a black another one. That is why schemes like ""Black capitalism"" have not caught on in the Black community; that is why some youngBblack people are currently pursuing a formal education while rejecting the normal success oriented goal of it.
Black people have always existed - and barely at that - at the sufferance of the establishment of the United States.
That was true nearly 100 years ago when the Civil War ended and we thought we have a chance at determining our own destinies. It is happening now at the end of a similar era of
4
hope and limited progress.
What is happening now happened once again is American history in the years after Reconstruction. The promises that Black people would be included in the social and economic life of the nation, were repudiated. Instead of fulfilling the dream, then and now:

The white crusaders for social justice and democracy became weary as Black people could no longer be considered a purely Southern problem;
The aspirations for and movement of Blacks began to be curtailed by organized violence and barbarity and by a series of legal manuevers designed to make Black men less than political and economic equals.
The hopes and belief of Black people that racial equality and social justice could be achieved through litigation, legislation, negotiation, occasional direct action and strong alliances with
5
	white liberal groups were supplanted by disillusionment, bitterness and open anger.
The guilt and indignation of Northern supporters of the Southern drive for equality turned into an attitude of cautious - and now open - racism when the Northern Black man began to take seriously the claims of progress and began to look for visible signs in Northern cities*.

Those who directed the movement from lunch counters to bus stations to voting booths to electoral politics are no longer there.
Those Northerners whose concern and whose money helped finance that movement are no longer concerned or financial.
The government we once thought sympathetic to our goals is either no longer the government or is no longer sympathetic.
6
The nation now spends thirty billion a year to interfere in the political future of fourteen million Vietnamese and less than one tenth that amount to insure a decent future for 27 million poor Black and white Americans now tells us that if the war ends today, we will not have thirty billion for domestic affairs but only eight billion.
It has been class vs. class and race vs. race in this country from the 17th century to this one.
It probably will continue to be that. What is discussable for today's purposes is not whether it will continue to be that, but how the question will be put in the future. What responses will those in power make? Will the establishment absorb again, as it does so well, those who rail against it?
The question of race will be increasingly put to the establishment on violent terms. This will not be the heated mass
7
violence of Watts and Detroit and Newark, but rather the violence that has begun to terrorize Draft Centers from coast to coast, the violence that has every white big city policeman more nervous and jumpy than he has ever been. In effect , the natives - some few of them, a small, small number, are becomeing guerillas, and the colonial administrators are becoming worried.
I do not condone or even urge, that Blacks begin campaigns of violence and terror aimed at the obvious symbols of the establishment, but that despite urging or condemnation by anyone, this will be the case. The day of wholesale looting and burning is passed, not because radical changes resulted from it, but because it is easier to attack two policemen at a time than it is to attack 200; it is easier and less costly in human life to destroy a downtown Credit Reference Bureau than it is to single out and destroy its colonial outpost in the ghetto; the records are down town and not in the ghetto, anyway.
8
While this activity occurs, and it is occuring now, every week in some part of the country, more standardized activity will be occuring as well.
That is to say that the whole range of Black activism will continue, from picket lines to voter registration drives to student disruptions to marches to draft refusals and to every other form of protest tried during the last decade.
What will be different in the future, however, is not just that Black men want the blue collar security of a union card, or that young Black people want a formal college education, but that the young and some of the old, both Black and white, are determined to follow the slogans of Eldridge Cleaver.. ""If you are not part of the solution, you're part of the problem."" And none of them wants now - or ever - to be a part of the problem.
9
Some will be, of course. The rewards of moderation are too great; the difficulty of the struggle is too exacting. But there is being produced, on the campus and in the streets, a new breed of young people for whom a generation gap is not 20 or 25 years, but from this year's graduating class to the next. The National Student Association, in research collected during two months of the last school year, discovered that 16,000 college students had been arrested for smoking marijuana. Smoking pot is not always revolutionary action, but it is anti-establishment, and I want to suggest that the 16,000 is a small and visible tip of a large and hidden iceberg.
This iceberg, unlike others, gets larger, rather than smaller, and it includes not just those who have dates with Mary
10
Jane, but those who have decided not to accept - and to show they do not accept - the same old bill of goods.
The war in Vietnam to them is not an aberration that has lately gone wrong; for them, and they are right, it never was right. White racism, to them, has been an American constant, not something discovered by Senator Fred Harris and John Lindseay and Former Governor Kerner; sex is something to be enjoyed, outdoors in the middle of the street, if you will, and not a hidden exercise in guilt.
The violence and the mindlessness that accompanies some of these ideas might not be attractive, but it can never equal the violence dispensed by those on what is called the other side.
So these young people may continue to grow in numbers as they discover that they old ways don't work. They are not the first
11
generation to make this discovery, but they are certainly the first generation to begin the process of withdrawal from establishment ranks while constructing their own alternative to it.
They are, you may say, constructing their own establishment, but surely it will not and cannot be the same thing. Surely it will aim away from profit oriented labor, and toward a new and yet undefined ethic that will insist on putting into practice what is now merely a slogan, ""Doing your own thing.""
A French student in Paris chants ""We are all German Jews"". A Black girl at Tougaloo College in Mississippi writes: ""The sharecropper is me, the domestic is me"".
They are determined to make a better world or know the reason why. They are determined, and they are marching straight from the pages of Tom Hayden's testimony earlier this year before
13
[The page numbering skips from 11 to 13, but the content is continuous.]
the House Committee on Un-American activities.
Hayden said then:
""We are going to win either way. The Chicago convention brutality was a tremendous kind of victory for the young people of this country who are not voters, people who are not polled by Gallup or Harris, but people who do watch television, and who do not identify with the young Nixon girls or David Eisenhower, but identify with the young people in the streets, and who watch very carefully. If you think you have had militant people before you in these hearings, you have yet to see what the seven and eight year olds are going to bring you in the next five to ten years.
You have taught them to have no respect for authority, and that is a victory in the sense that committees like yourselves are through. You exist only formally; you exist officially, but you have lost all authority, and when a group of people who have power lose their authority, they have lost. You have lost, period.""
I believe that is the epitaph for establishments. They have lost, period.
30
While those in power have lost, they have not yet surrendered. They will continue to hold power until educated men and women combine to stamp out racism and facism and militarism and imperialism

What has happened in the United States since the first black people set foot here in 19 1619 is that everything has changed and nothing has changed. , particularly for us in the South.
For one, we are no longer slaves. Secondly, we can sit at lunch counters, sit downstairs at movie theatres, ride in the front of busses, register and vote where we once could not.
But in a great many ways, we are constantly discovering that things have either not changed at all, or have become much worse.
A quick look at all of the facts and figures that measure how well - or how poorly - a people are doing - the kinds of statistics that measure infant mortality, unemployment, median family income, life expectancy - demonstrates clearly that the average black American, while better off then his father was, is actually worse off when his statistics are measured against similar ones for white people.
It is as though black Americans are climBiNG a molasses mountain in snowshoes, white white people are riding a ski lift to the top.
It is these depressing figures, and the accompanying pathology which results from them, that cause so much discontent and depression in black communities today.
The realization that over the years the diverse strategies of Booker T. Washington and Dr. W. E. B. DuBois and Marcus Garvey and and Martin Luther King and Malcomn X have not separately improved the lot of the masses of black folk, has understandably convinced many black people that such progress can never occur.
The separate agitations these philosophies gave birth to - a retreaturn to Africa, a struggle in the courts, a nonviolent thrust into the streets, a violent attempt at doing real injury to white America - all these have accustomed many white people to believe that black people have by now got everything they want, and half of what white folks need too.
But the problem so often referred to as America's black problem - in reality and massive white problem - continues. It continues despite Wars on Poverty and Great Societies and New Fronteirs and will continue despite the nNew fFederalism.
The roots of the problem are deep in the fabric of this country, and began with the rape of Africa, the stealing of child from mother, husband from wife, the destruction of various cultures and religions, the separation of whole people from their land and their country.
They involve the basest of predjudices, and thes an economic system that has always placed property over people - the results of these ] 4 has been to place and keep black people at the bottom of the ladder that in this nation is susposed to lead to jobs and homes and education and security.
It has made us the last first last to the be hired and the first to be fired; it has recently - as any reading of Vietnam casualty lists will show - made us first in war if not first in the hearts of our countrymen. It has given black children an opportunity to attend school for twelve years while receiving 5 years of education. It has placed us on relief to be scored as lazy and shiftless while 6,000 white American farmers are paid $25,000 each a year to not to work., and while oil millionaires receive an automatic 27 ½% tax write-off every year.
It short, we are in bad shape. The gains made yesterday are gone today. The victories won in the wars of 1954 and 1960 are ] 5 negated by the winner of the battle of 1968.
We are now, near the end of 1969, facing and a government and an administration that is more hostile toward our aspirations than any other in the recent past.
That is not to say, however that the two administrations that proceded it were measurably better in all respects.
The Kennedy years, bright with promise, gave us statements about ending discrimination with the stroke of a pen that could not be found, while the Johnson era gave us further involvement in a senseless war that not only rapes the county of its young manhood - and the black community more nearly so - but also pulled the best minds and energies of the government into prosecuting a war against the best instincts we were all taught the country stood for. ] 6
But it is the Nixon - Agnew - Thurmond combine that has power now and it is thair their philosophy that closely parallells that of Rutherford B. Hayes -that a philosophy that in the first instance, ended Reconstruction, the single American era in which democracy in America meant the same in Maine Mississippi as it did in Mississippi Maine, an era in which black men believed in the franchise; an era in which school integration was a fact, and not a dream. Hayes's deal with the South ended that dream; Nixon's deal with the land speculator and Cinderella bridegroom from South Carolina has ended a second such period of hope and expaectation.
It might truthfully be said, however, that the era was ending before Richard Nixon rose from the dead. It began ending when the American conscience either no longer cared or dissapeared. It began to end when Northern black people decided that ] 7 freedom and liberty meant them too, and it began ending when blacks in South Chicago and the Hough District in Cleveland and Watts in Los Angeles decided that the right to vote or sit at lunch counters or to peacefully petition the government for a redress of your greivances meant nothing to a people who were living in t a 20th Century vision version of a colony, a social, educational , and economic colony that was as effectively administered from outside as was the American colony in 1776, of or the Vietnamese colony before the Vietnamese people decided that they could rule themselves better than could any Frenchmen or Japanese or Americans, for that matter.
The question for us, then, is how to escape from this colonial status. Ought we to follow the example set out by the Minute Men at Concord, or the hardy band of revolutionaries who looted ] 8 in the Boston harbor?
Or ought we instead, wait for the mother country - in this case white America - to grant us freedom only when we have demonstrated that we are "" ready "" for it?
One should like to hope that neither would be our choice. The likelyhood of an understaffed, unarmed, socially identifiable minority overthrowing an entrenched, well armed majority in a nation like this is rather slim at present. It was Che Guevera who said ""the streets of Harlem are not the mountains of the Sierra Mastre.""
The oppressed peopls of this nation has several options available to them; they quite properly ought to exercise them all.
This would mean, then, that black people ought to agitate, demonstrate separate, integrate; we ought to socialize, capitalize, and radicalize; we ought to do
That is to suggest that an oppressed people cannot chose a single means of freeing themselves from oppression, but that any and every method must be explored and attempted. ] 9
The black people of the South, for example, are attempting to try an old American method that has proved successful for other groups. That method is political, which for the group of new newly enfranchised people, is neither the art of compromise or the art of possible, but the art of seeing who gets how much of what from whom.
They enter into politics without believing that the vote, and the vote alone, can free a people who have been held in near chattle slavery for hundreds of years, but believing sincerely that it does who governs whom does make a difference.
It makes a difference, they say, that Charles Evers is Mayor of Fayettte, Mississippi; it makes a difference, they say, that black people control Hancock County, Georgia and Greene County, Alabama, that Atlanta has a black Vice-Mayor and it will make a difference as black people extend their control over the 150 other black belt counties in this region. ] 10
This job will not be doen by these people themselves. They need money, and they need the kinds of technical skills which are often availavle from northern communities.
They are disturbed by the deriding of politics they hear from militant youth, who from the safety and sanctuary of the campus can attempt to decide whether or not black people in the South are dupes and fools when they vote in an election, or whether a black candidate for sheriff in rural Alabama is in reality a colonial administrator.
They are disturbed when their attempts to raise money in the North are frustrated.
They are disturbed when students - black and white - who could spend vacations registering voters or organizinfg cooperatives choose instead to argue the question of whether or not the late ] 11 Ho Chi Minh was a revisionist.
And they are most disturbed when an the Attorney General of the United States tells an audience of policemen in Miami that lLaw and oOrder will be upheld by the Nixon administration "" with all its moral, political and economic power "" at the same moment when the Chief of the Civil Rights Division of the Justice Department is saying that the United States lacks the power to uphold the lS Supreme Counrt decision integrating schools that is already 16 Septembers old.
But they expected no help from this quarter; they expected, instead, as they always have, they their last and best resource would be themselves.
They have lived through the beginning of and the end of one period of hope, and are willing, almost incredibly, to begin another.
A period in which there are no student caravans South, in which theere are no visiting, sympathetic congressmen, a period in which no entertainers will dance and sing for them in a small back country church.es.
They believe, as did Frederick Douglass almost 100 years ago, that ""Men may not get all they pay for in this world, but they certainly pay for all that they get. If we ever get free from oppression and wrong that is heaped upon us, we must pay for their removal. We must do this by labor, by suffering, by sacrifice, and if need be, by our lives, and the lives of others.""

Julian Bond — November, 1969
What has happened in the United States since the first Black people set foot here in 1619 is that everything has changed and nothing has changed, particularly for us in the South.
For one, we are no longer slaves. Secondly, we can sit at lunch counters, sit downstairs at movie theaters, ride in the front of buses, register and vote where we once could not.

Politics, as it has existed in the South, is changing. Its history is a sorry one, a history of white repression and Black subjugation. It is a history with only one bright moment, the ten years of Reconstruction, the ten American years when democracy meant as much in Mississippi as it did in Maine, the ten years in which an aggressive national government acted with armed might to protect the civil and political rights of Southern Black political hopefuls.
From the closing of that period of hope just before the beginning of the Twentieth Century — the century whose problem, Dr. W. E. B. DuBois said would be ""the problem of the color line"" to the point just past the middle of the twentieth, Black Americans have seen their fortunes ebb and rise and now, ebb again.
They have seen political promises made and broken in Washington. From the days when Frederick Douglass said ""the Republican party is
7
the ship; all else is the sea"" to the days of Franklin Delano Roosevelt, Black people have tried first one, and now the other, national political party.
They have been ill served by politicians whom the late Ralph McGill once called ""so grotesque it seems impossible they could have been influential.""
But now they are led by another group, the Wallaces, the Maddoxes, the Stennises, and Eastlands are realized now for what they have always been: marching backward like an off-key and off-course salvation army band going to the field to convert the saved into sinners.
Instead, a new crop of national political leaders has begun the task the white South once believed was theirs alone: deciding on the proper political, educational and economic position for the
8
region's Black people.
This new group is made of some old faces — a President who rose from the dead, a Southern Senator who has belonged to three political parties, and a new Attorney General who surely must be the first man to hold his job in recent years who can receive a standing ovation from white Mississippians.
As that first Reconstruction ended with a deal made in a hotel room, this second one ended that way too — a deal made in Miami Beach that gave the white South veto power over Supreme Court nominees, gave the white South hope that the drive to register Black voters would stop, gave the white South hope that the slow pace of school integration would move even slower.
And it has been so, the Attorney General of the United States introduces a voting rights bill that cannot pass, while one that has
9
raised the level of Black voters in the South to nearly sixty percent of the eligible total is slowly creeping toward expiration.
The United States Department of Justice joins hands with Mississippi to halt school integration.
Federal contractors are allowed to receive federal monies with the usual anti-discrimination pledges.
The Vice-President tells us that he opposes bussing, and the President agrees. A welfare plan is proposed which will help subsidize the South's employers of cheap labor.
But from this region, despite the force of fear that still reigns across it and despite the sure knowledge that no help whatsoever will come from Washington, a certain hope appears.
It a hope which somes, perhaps, from the region's rich tradition of struggle, a struggle that did not begin with Martin
10
Luther King in Montgomery but with Nat Turner and Denmark Vesey, a struggle that has shown an oppressed people struggling against impossible odds with little or no help from outside.
In recent years, this struggle has been characterized by the bravery of rural Black people, aided by student allies, supported in the past with the finances of the liberal North, to capture and win the franchise.
It was the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee, the NAACP, the Congress of Racial Equality and the Southern Christian Leadership Congress that did the job of government in trying to bring democracy to the South. It was these groups and their supporters who badgered and bullied Wasington into each minimal response to the physical and psychological brutality of the region.
And it was these groups, their supporters, and above all the Black men and women of the states of the Old Confederacy, who have the option, the government willing, to put reality and decency into American poli

And it was these groups, their supporters, and above all, the Black men and women of the Old Confederacy, who have the option, the government willing, to put reality and decency into American politics again.
Incidentally, the politically sophisticated Black people of this region are beginning to wonder whether this re-making process will be done under the wings of the Democratic Party, as many had once believed. It may be the party of Hubert Humphrey, to whom they gave ninety plus percent of their votes in 1968, but isn't it also the party of Eastland and Stennis and Wallace in Alabama and Maddox? Isn't it the party which gives credibility and responsibility to the Russells and the Talmadges, and will it always be the only one we've got?
The most recent politicizing of the black belt South began
12
in Mississippi and culminated with the Democratic Convention in 1964. At that meeting, insurgents from Mississippi presented the Democratic Party with a clear cut choice between right and wrong, between totalitarianism and democracy.
But the President said no, and one by one the liberals said no, too.
But between 1964 and 1968, a ripple grew across the South. In Alabama, Selma occurred. In southwest Georgia, Black people moved, in Mississippi and Alabama the sleeping Black giant awakened.
In Alabama, the political futures of that state's Black and few white liberal political hopefuls are held by the national Democratic Party, an insurgent group that has captured the court house in one county and is preparing to do the same in some twenty others.
In Mississippi, while the Mississippi Freedom Democratic
13
Party has been absorbed on the one hand and destroyed on the other, there still exists strong independant party spirit.
In southwest Georgia, a group of Black people, heretofore untouched by the modern civil rights movement, are preparing to inject some color into Georgia's congressional delegation within the next four to six years.
This job will not be done by these people themselves. They need money, and they need the kinds of technical skills which are often available from northern communities.
They are disturbed by the deriding of politics they hear from militant college youth, who from the safety and sanctuary of the campus can attempt to decide whether or not Black people in the South are dupes and fools when they vote in an election, or whether a Black candidate for sheriff in rural Alabama is in reality a colonial administrator.
14
They are disturbed when their attempts to raise money in the North are frustrated.
They are disturbed when students, Black and white, who could spend vacations registering voters or organizing cooperatives choose instead to argue the question of whether or not the late Ho Chi Minh was a revisionist.
And they are disturbed when the Attorney General of the United States tells an audience of policemen in Miami that Law and Order will be upheld by the Nixon administration ""with all its moral, political and economic power"" at the same moment when the chief of the Civil Rights Division of the Justice Department is saying in Washington that the United States lacks the power to uphold the Supreme Court decision integrating schools that is already 16 Septembers old.
15
But they expected no help from this quarter; they expected, instead, as they always have, that their last and best resource would be themselves.
They have lived through the beginning and the end of one period of hope, and are willing, almost incredibly, to begin another.
A period in which there are no student caravans South, in which there are no visiting, sympathetic congressmen, a period in which no entertainers will dance and sing for them in small back country churches.
They believe, as did Frederick Douglass almost 100 years ago, that ""Men may not get all they pay for in this world, but they certainly pay for all they get. If we ever get free from the oppression and wrong that is heaped upon us, we must pay for their removal. We must do this by labor, by suffering, by sacrifice, and if need be, by our lives, and the lives of others.""

Julian Bond - November 1969
What has happened in the United States since the first Black people set foot here in 1619 is that everything has changed and nothing has changed, particularly for us in the South.
For one, we are no longer slaves. Secondly, we can sit at lunch counters, sit downstairs at movie theatres, ride in the front of buses, register and vote where we once could not.
But in a great many ways, we are constantly discovering that things have either not changed at all, or have become much worse.
A quick look at all of the facts and figures that measure how well, or how poorly, a people are doing — the kinds of statistics that measure infant mortality, unemployment, median family income, life expectancy — demonstrates clearly that the average Black American, while better off than his father was, is actually worse off when
2
his statistics are measured against similar ones for white people.
Insert #1
It is as though Black Americans are climbing a molasses mountain in snowshoes, while white people are riding a skit lift to the top. ] 3
It is these depressing figures, and the accompanying pathology which results from them, that causes so much discontent and depression in Black communities today.
The realization is that over the years the diverse strategies of Booker T. Washington and Dr. W. E. B. DuBois and Marcus Garvey and Martin Luther King and Malcolm X have not separately improved the lot of the masses of Black folk, but it has convinced many Black people that such progress will never occur.
The separate agitations these philosopies gave birth to — a return to Africa, struggle in the courts, a nonviolent thrust into the streets, a violent attempt at doing real injury to white
3
America — all these have accustomed many white people to believe that Black people have by now got everything they want, and half of what white folks need too. ] 4
But the problem so often referred to as America's Black problem — in actuality a massive white problem — continues. It continues despite Wars on Poverty and Great Societies and New Frontiers and will continue despite the New Federalism.
The roots of the problem are deep in the fabric of this country, and began with the rape of Africa, the stealing of child from mother, husband from wife, the destruction of various cultures and religions, the separation of a whole people from their land and their country.
They involve the basest of prejudices, and an economic system that has always placed property over people — the results of these
4
have been to place and keep Black people at the bottom of the ladder that in this nation is supposed to lead to jobs and homes and education and security.
It has made us the last to be hired and the first to be fired; it has recently, as any reading of Vietnam casualty lists will show, made us first in war if not first in the hearts of our countrymen. ] 5 It has given Black children an opportunity to attend schools for twelve years while receiving five years of education. It has placed us on relief to be scored as lazy and shiftless while 6,000 white American farmers are paid $25,000 each a year not to work, and while oil millionaires receive an automatic 27 ½% tax write off every year.
In short, we are in bad shape. The gains made yesterday are gone today. The victories won in the wars of 1954 and 1960 are being negated by the winner of the battle of 1968.
  6 4-A
But It is the Nixon/Agnew/Thurmond combine that has power now and it is their philosophy that closely parallels that of Rutherford B. Hayes: a philosophy that in the first instance, ended Reconstruction, the single American era in which democracy in America meant the same in Mississippi as it did in Maine; an era in which Black men believed in the franchise; an era in which school integration was a fact, and not a dream. Hayes' deal with the South ended that dream; Nixon's ] 6 deal with the land speculator and Cinderella Bridegroom from South Carolina has ended a second such period of hope and expectation.
It might truthfully be said, however, that the era was ending before Richard Nixon rose from the dead. It began ending when the American conscience either no longer cared or disappeared. It began to end when Northern Black people decided that the right
7 4-A
to freedom and liberty meant that for them too, and it began ending when Blacks in South Chicago and the Hough district in Cleveland and Watts in Los Angeles decided that the right to vote or sit at lunch counters or to peacefully petition the government for a redress of grievances meant nothing to a people who were living in a 20th century version of a colony, a social, educational, and economic colony that was effectively administered and controlled from outside as was the American colony in 1776, or the Vietnamese colony before the Vietnamese people decided that they could rule themselves better than could ] 7 any Frenchmen or Japanese or Americans, for that matter.
The question for us, then, is how to escape from this colonial status. Ought we to follow the example set out by the Minute Men at Concord, or the hardy band of revolutionaries who looted ships
8 4-A
in the Boston harbor?
Or ought we instead, wait for the mother country — in this case white America — to grant us freedom only when we have demonstrated that we are ""ready"" for it?
One should like to hope that neither would be our choice. The likelihood of an understaffed, unarmed, socially identifiable minority overturning an entrenched, well armed majority in a nation like this is rather slim at present. It was Che Guevera who said ""the streets of Harlem are not the mountains of the Sierra Mastre.""
The oppressed people of this nation have several options available to them; they quite properly ought to exercise them all.
That is to suggest that an oppressed people cannot choose a single means of freeing themselves from oppression, but that any and every method must be explored and attempted.
5
The Black people of the South, for example however, are attempting to try an old American method that has proved successful for other ] 8 groups. That method is politics, which for this group of newly enfranchised people, is neither the art of compromise or the art of the possible, but the art of seeing who gets how much of what from whom.
They enter into politics without believing that the vote, and the vote alone, can free a people who have been held in near chattel slavery for hundreds of years, but believing sincerely that who governs whom does make a difference.
It makes a difference, they say, that Charles Evers is Mayor of Fayette, Mississippi; it makes a difference, they say, when Black people control Hancock County, Georgia and Greene County Alabama, that Atlanta has a Black Vice-Mayor, and it will make a difference as Black people extend their control over the 150 other black belt counties in this region.
6
Politics, as it has existed in the South, is changing. Its history is a sorry one, a history of white repression and Black subjugation. It is a history with only one bright moment, ] 9 the ten years of Reconstruction . , the ten American years when democracy meant as much in Mississippi as it did in Maine, the ten years in which an aggressive national government acted with armed might to protect the civil and political rights of Southern Black political hopefuls.
From the closing of that period of hope just before the beginning of the Twentieth Century — the century whose problem, Dr. W. E. B. DuBois said would be ""the problem of the color line"" to this point just past the middle of the twentieth, Black Americans have seen their political fortunes ebb and rise and now, ebb again.
They have seen political promises made and broken in Washington. From the days when Frederick Douglass said ""the Republican party is

the ship; all else is the sea"" to the days of Franklin Delano Roosevelt, Black people have tried first one, and now the other, national political party.
They have been ill serviced by politicians whom the late Ralph McGill once called ""so grotesque it seems impossible they could have been influential.""
But now they are led see the nation lead by another group. The Wallaces, the Maddoxes, the Stennises, and Eastlands are realized now ] 10 for what they have always been: marching backward like an off-key and off-course salvation army band going to the field to convert the saved into sinners.
Instead of these old faces a new crop of national political leaders has begun the task the white South once believed was theirs alone: deciding on the proper political, educational and economic position for the
Insert # 1 (page 2)
There are 20 million Black Americans; 5 million Mexican Americans; 3 million Peurto Ricans and half-million Indians in this country. The depressing statistics for Black people are nearly true for all the other non-white groups.
If a When a Black child is born, his chance of dying in his first year is double that for a child born outside the ghetto. His chance of being mentally retarded are twice the community average. ] 2 His chances of graduating from high school are three out of ten: when he does graduate, there is a fifty-fifty chance he will have the equivalent of a eighth grade education. Despite the progress claimed by Daniel Patrick Monihan, the Department of Labor said a short while ago: ""Economic and social conditions are getting worse, not better, in the ghetto.""
Unemployment among black people in some parts of the country is 40%. ,Aand that, before ""benign neglect."" If that figure were true for the general population, there would be 30 million Americans out of work. Among those Black men with jobs, more than a fourth earn less than $60.00 a week, or less than a family of four needs to eat 70¢ worth of food a day. 
Insert # 2 (page 8)
And the policy of neglect has been faithfully persued. A series of incompetents are nominated to the Supreme Court. The administration — and some misgyided liberals — jump into bed with senator ] 11 Stennis. The Department of Justice has hired so-called Black militants to help destroy the push for school integration. The administration tries to destroy the 1965 Voting Rights Act,

region's Black people.
This new group is made of some old faces — a President who rose from the dead who cannot be trusted, a Southern Senator who has belonged to three political parties, and a new Attorney General who surely must be the first man to hold his job in recent years who can receive a standing ovation from white adult Mississippians.

And there are some who profess sympathy and understanding but ask ""What can I do?"" Frederick Douglass, on the day before he died in his 77th year, answered both all of these questions: he said ""The marvel is that the old trick of misnaming things, so often displayed by Southern politicians, should have worked so well for the bad cause for which it is not employed, for the American people have fallen in with the bad idea that this is a Negro problem, a question of the character of the Negro, and not a question ] 16 of the nation.… he has as little to do with the cause of the problem as he has to do with its cure. Now what the real problem is we all ought to know. It is not a Negro problem, but a national problem. It involves the question of whether after all our boasted civilization, our Declaration of Independence, our Constitution, our sublime Christianity, our statesmanship, we as a people, possess virtue enough to solve this problem.
""But how can the problem be solved? Let the white people of the North and South conquer their predjudices. Let the American people cultivate kindness and humanity. Let them give up the idea that they can be free while making the Negro a slave. They are not required to do much. They are only required to undo the evil they have done, in order to solve this problem
""Put away your race predjudice. Banish the idea that one class must rule over another. Recognize the facts that the rights of the humblest of citizens are as worthy of protection as are those of ] 17 the highest and your problem will be solved, and whatever may be in store for you in the future, whether prosperity of adversity, whether you have foes without or foes within, whether there shall be peace or war, based on the eternal principles of truth, justice and humanity, with no class having cause for complaint of greaivance, your republic will stand and flourish foever..""*

The pertinent question for us in 1971 is whether we — and those others who have susposed to be in sympathy with us — will let 1968 happen again.
It was more in '68 than Nixon winning and Humphrey losing. It was more than the Republicans in; the issue of 1968 — and the coming issue in 1972 — is whale what is the relo political relationship between Black and white America to be?
That question fits inside another. What is our relationship to each other? Do we still believe that the white man's ice is colder, his sugar sweeter, his medecine stronger?
And what kind of politics are we to have in 1972. Will it be a repeat of 1968, when Black delegates at the Democratic Convention had to check with a white boss before they could sneeze? A repeat of Blacks
Or will there be serious minded and independent delegates there, pledged to Black people and our political future. ] 6
If we could get it together, will we once again simply deliver warm Black bodies and Black votes to whomever the Democrats put up, or will we insist that the candidate who gets these votes must deliver jobs and power to us?
That is the basis for the Black agenda in the '70s.

On another, higher level, the nominee must be someone who delivers reality, not rhetoric to the Black community.
It must be someone who will put teeth into the demands for a decent life.

Since the present President took office, we have spent billions more on war, over two million more Americans have been added to the

ranks of ] 9 the unemployed, 2.5 million more are on ever-mounting relief rolls, inflation has reduced our standard of living, many American cities face bankruptcy. The racist policies of public and private U.S. institutions insure that Black and other oppressed peoples suffer more than others, in good times and in bad.
The Vice-Presidents's selection is less important, but must be watched as well. Most importantly, it must not be one of the new crop of Dixie governors, these professional white Southerners who are like political nymphomaniacs, satiated only by the ultimate concession to their desires, a return to chattel slavery, a return to the illicit and incestuous political and personal relationships their ancestors enjoyed in the past. They hide behind the gratituitous Northern inclination to compare them to the worst of what we had before; they win easy congratulations for making statements on race in Georgia that would start a riot in Harlem.

The Vice-President tells us that he opposes bussing, and the President agrees. A welfare plan is proposed which will help subsidize the South's employers of cheap labor.
But from this region us , despite the force of fear and apathy that still reigns across it for many of us and despite the sure knowledge that no help whatsoever will come from Washington, a certain hope appears.
It a hope which scomes, perhaps, from those region's our rich tradition ] 11 of struggle, a struggle that did not begin with Martin
10
Luther King in Montgomery but with Nat Turner and Denmark Vesey, a struggle that has shown an oppressed people struggling against impossible odds with little or no help from outside.
In recent years, this struggle has been characterized by the bravery of rural Black people, aided by student allies, supported in the past with the finances of the liberal North, to capture and win the franchise.
It was the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee, the NAACP, the Congress of Racial Equality and the Southern Christian Leadership Congress that did the job of government in trying to bring democracy to the South. It was these groups and their supporters who badgered and bullied Washington into each minimal response to the physical and psychological brutality of the region.
11
And it was these groups, their supporters, and above all, the Black men and women of the Old Confederacy, who have the option, the government willing, to put reality and decency into American politics again.
Incidentally, the politically sophisticated Black people of this region are are beginning to wonder whether this re-making process will be done under the wings of the Democratic Party, as many had once believed. It may be the party of Hubert Humphrey, to whom they we gave ninety plus percent of their votes in 1968, but isn't it also the party of Eastland and Stennis and Wallace in Alabama and Maddox? Isn't it the party which gives credibility and responsibility to the Russels ? and Talmadges, and will it always be the only one we've got?
The most recent politicizing of the black belt South began
12
in Mississippi and culminated with the Democratic Convention in 1964. At that meeting, insurgents from Mississippi presented the Democratic Party with a clear cut choice between right and wrong, between totalitarianism and democracy.
But the President said no, and one by one the liberals said no, too.
But between 1964 and 1968, a ripple grew across the South. In Alabama, Selma occurred. In southwest Georgia, Black people moved, in Mississippi and Alabama the sleeping Black giant awakened.
In Alabama, the political futures of that state's Black and few white liberal political hopefuls are held by the national Democratic Party, an insurgent group that has captured the court house in one county and is preparing to do the same in some twenty others.
In Mississippi, while the Mississippi Freedom Democratic
13
Party has been absorbed on the one hand and destroyed on the other, there still exists strong independent party spirit. 
In southwest Georgia, a group of Black people, heretofore untouched by the modern civil rights movement, are preparing to inject some color into Georgia's congressional delegation within the next four to six years.
This job will not be done by these people themselves. They need money, and they need the kinds of technical skills which are often available from Northern communities. ] 12
They are disturbed by the deriding of politics they hear from militant college youth, who from the safety and sanctuary of the campus can attempt to decide whether or not Black people in the South are dupes and fools when they vote in an election, or whether a Black candidate for sheriff in rural Alabama is in reality a colonial administrator.
14
They are disturbed when their attempts to raise money in the South from liberals are frustrated.
They are disturbed when students, Black and white, who could spend vacations registering voters or organizing cooperatives choose instead to argue the question of whether or not the late Ho Chi Minh was a revisionist.
And they are disturbed when the Attorney General of the United States tells an audience of policemen in Miami that Law and Order will be upheld by the Nixon administration ""with all its moral, ] 12 political and economic power"" at the same moment when the chief of the Civil Rights Division of the Justice Department is saying in Washington that the United States lacks the power to uphold the Supreme Court decision integrating schools that is already 16 Septembers old.
15
But they we expected no help from this quarter; they we must expected, instead, as they we always have, that their our last and best resource would be themourselves.
They We have lived through the beginning and the end of one period of hope, and are willing, almost incredibly, to begin another.
(insert)
A period in which there are no student caravans South, in which there are no visiting, sympathetic congressmen, a period in which no entertainers will dance and sing for them in small back country churches.
They We must believe, as did Frederick Douglass almost 100 years ago, that ""Men may not get all they pay for in this world, but they certainly pay for all they get. If we ever get free from the oppression and wrong that is heaped upon us, we must pay for their removal. We must do this by labor, by suffering, by sacrifice, and if need be, by our lives, and the lives of others.""

(insert page 15)
A period in which we must ignore the siren call to align with people who have not got our interests at heart, but must operate a selfish politics, believing that whatever is good for us will be good for the rest of the country as well.

What has happened in the United States since the first Black people set foot here in 1619 is that everything has changed and nothing has changed, particularly for us in the South.
For one, we are no longer slaves. Secondly, we can sit at lunch counters, sit downstairs at movie theaters, sit in the front of buses, register and vote where we once could not.
But in a great many ways, we are constantly discovering that things have either not changed at all, or have become much worse.
A quick look at all of the facts and figures that measure how well, or how poorly, a people are doing — the kinds of statistics that measure infant mortality, unemployment, median family income, life expectancy — demonstrates clearly that the average Black American, while better off than his father was, is actually worse off when his statistics are measured against similar ones for white people.
There are 20 million Black Americans; 5 million Mexican Americans; 3 million Puerto Ricans and a half million Indians in this country. The depressing statistics for Black people are nearly true for all the other nonwhite groups.
When a Black child is born, his chance of dying in his first year is double that for a child born outside the ghetto. His chance of being mentally retarded are twice the community average.
2
His chances of graduating from high school are three out of ten; when he does graduate, there is a fifty-fifty chance he will have the equivalent of an eighth grade education. Despise the progress claimed by Daniel Patrick Monihan, the Department of Labor said a short while ago: ""Economic and social conditions are getting worse, not better, in the ghetto.""
Unemployment among Black people in some parts of the country is 40%, and that, before ""benign neglect."" If that figure were true for the general population, there would be 30 million Americans out of work. Among those Black men with jobs, more than a fourth earn less than $60 a week, or less than a family of four needs to eat 70 cents worth of food a day.
It is as though Black Americans are climbing a molasses mountain in snowshoes, while white people are riding a ski lift to the top.
3
It is these depressing figures, and the accompanying pathology which results from them, that causes so much discontent and depression in Black communities today.
The realization is that over the years the diverse strategies of Booker T. Washington and Dr. W.E.B. DuBois and Marcus Garvey and Martin Luther King and Malcolm X have not separately improved the lot of the masses of Black folk, but have convinced many Black people that such progress will never occur.
The separate agitations these philosophies gave birth to — a return to Africa, a struggle in the courts, a nonviolent thrust into the streets, a violent attempt at doing real injury to white America — all these have accustomed many white people to believe that Black people have by now got everything they want, and half of what white folks need too.
4
But the problem so often referred to as America's Black problem continues. It continues despite Wars on Poverty and Great Societies and New Frontiers and will continue despite the New Federalism.
The roots of the problem are deep in the fabric of this country, and began with the rape of Africa, the stealing of child from mother, husband from wife, the destruction of various cultures and religions, the separation of a whole people from their land and their country.
They involve the basest of prejudices, and an economic system that has always placed property over people — the results of these have been to place and keep Black people at the bottom of the ladder that in this nation is supposed to lead to jobs and homes and education and security.
It has made us the last to be hired and the first to be fired; it has recently, as any readings of Vietnam casualty lists will show, made us first in war if not first in the hearts of our countrymen.
5
It has given Black children an opportunity to attend school for twelve years while receiving five years of education. It has placed us on relief to be scored as lazy and shiftless while 6,000 white American farmers are paid $25,000 each a year not to work, and while oil millionaires receive an automatic 27-1/2% tax write off every year.
In short, we are in bade shape. The gains made yesterday are gone today. The victories won in the wars of 1954 and 1960 are being negated by the winner of the battle of 1968.
It is the Nixon /Agnew/  Mitchell Thurmond combine that has power now and it is their philosophy that closely parallels that of Rutherford B. Hayes: a philosophy that in the first instance, ended Reconstruction, the single American era in which democracy in America meant the same in Mississippi as it did in Maine, an era in which Black men believed in the franchise; an era in which school integration was a fact, and not a dream. Hayes' deal with the South ended that dream; Nixon's
6
deal with the land speculator and Cinderella Bridegroom from South Carolina has ended a second such period of home and expectation.
It might truthfully be said, however, that the era was ending before Richard Nixon rose from the dead. It began ending when the American conscience either no longer cared or disappeared. It began to end when Northern Black people decided that the right to freedom and liberty meant them too, and it began ending when Blacks in South Chicago and the Hough District in Cleveland and Watts in Los Angeles decided that the right to vote or sit at lunch counters or to peacefully petition the government for a redress of grievances meant nothing to a people who were living a 20th century version of a colony, a social, educational, and economic colony that was as effectively administered and controlled from outside as was the American colony in 1776, or the Vietnamese colony before the Vietnamese people decided that they could rule themselves better than could
7
any Frenchmen or Japanese or Americans, for that matter.
The question for us, then, is how to escape from the colonial status. Ought we to follow the example set out by the Minutemen at Concord, or the hardy band of revolutionaries who looted ships in the Boston harbor?
Or ought we instead, wait for the mother country — in this case white America — to grant us freedom when we demonstrated that we are ""ready"" for it?
Ought we to follow the example set out by the Minutemen at Concord, or the hardy band of revolutionaries who looted ships in the Boston harbor?
The oppressed people of this nation have several options available to them; they quite properly ought to exercise them all.
That is to suggest that an oppressed people cannot choose a single means of freeing themselves from oppression, but that any and every method must be explored and attempted.
The Black people of the South, however, are attempting to try an old American method that has proved successful for other
8
groups. That method is politics, which for this group of newly enfranchised people, is neither the act of compromise or the art of the possible, but the art of seeing who gets how much of what from whom.
They enter into politics without believing that the vote, and the vote alone, can free a people who have been held in near chattel slavery for hundreds of years, but believing sincerely that who governs whom does make a difference.
It makes a difference, they say, that Charles Evers is Mayor of Fayette, Mississippi; it makes a difference, they say, when Black people control Hancock County, Georgia and Greene County, Alabama, that Atlanta has a Black Vice Mayor, and it will make a difference as Black people extend their control over the 150 other black belt counties in this region.
Politics, as it has existed in the South, is changing. Its history is a sorry one, a history with only one bright moment,
9
the ten years of Reconstruction.
From the closing of that period of hope just before the beginning of the Twentieth Century — the century whose problem, Dr. W.E.B. DuBois said would be the ""problem of the color line"" to this point just past the middle of the twentieth, Black Americans have seen their political fortunes ebb and rise and now, ebb again.
They have seen political promises made and broken in Whashington. From the days when Frederick Douglass said ""the Republican party is the ship; all else is the sea"" to the days of Franklin Delano Roosevelt, Black people have tried first one, and now the other, national political party.
They have been ill served by politicians whom the late Ralph McGill once called ""so grotesque it seems impossible they could have been influential.""
But now they see the nation led by another group. The Wallaces, the Maddoxes, the Stennises, and Eastlands are realized now
10
for what they have always been: marching backward like an off key and off course salvation army band going to the field to convert the saved into sinners.
Instead of these old faces a new crop of national political leaders has begun the task the white South once believed was theirs alone: deciding on the proper political, educational and economic position for the region's Black people.
This new group is made of some old faces — a President who cannot be trusted that you wouldn't buy a used car from, a Southern Senator who has belonged to three political parties, and a new Attorney General who surely must be the first man to hold his job in recent years who can receive a standing ovation from white adult Mississippians.
And the policy of neglect has been faithfully pursued. A series of incompetents are nominated to the Supreme Court. The administration — and some misguided liberals — jump into bed with Senator
11
Stennis. The Department of Justice has hired so called Black militants to help destroy the push for school integration. The administration tries to destroy the 1965 Voting Rights Act. ,& the slow pace of school integration.
But from this region, despite the force of fear that still reigns across it and despite the sure knowledge that no help whatsoever will come from Washington, a certain hope appears.
It is a hope which comes, perhaps, from this region's rich tradition of struggle, a struggle that did not begin with Martin Luther King in Mongtomery but with Nat Turner and Denmark Vesey, a struggle that has shown an oppressed people struggling against impossible odds with little or no help from outside.
In recent years, this struggle has been characterized by the bravery of rural Black people, aided by student allies, supported in the past with the finances of the liberal North, to capture and win the franchise.

[A handwritten line here.]
I said, earlier in my remarks, that some people like to think of this problem as ""the Black problem."" There are also those other Americans who come from groups of European immigrants — unlike us, to be sure voluntary immigrants, to be sure — who believe that since they have risen to influence and affluence, then Black people can easily do the same. And there are some who profess sympathy and understanding but ask ""What can I do?"" Frederick Douglass, in his 77th year, answered all of these questions: he said "" The marvel is that the old trick of misnaming things, so often displayed by Southern politicians, should have worked so well for the bad cause for which it is now employed, for the American people have fallen in with the bad idea that this is a Negro problem, a question of the character of the Negro, and not a question
16
of the nation . . . . He The Negro has as little to do with the cause of the problem as he has to do with the cure. Now what the real problem is we all ought to know. It is not a Negro problem, but a national white problem. It involves the question of whether after all our their boasted civilization, our their Declaration of Independence, our their Constitution, our their sublime Christianity, our their statesmanship, we they as a people, possess virtue enough to solve this problem.
""But how can the problem be solved? Let the white people of the North and South conquer their prejudices. Let the American people them cultivate kindness Christianity and humanity. Let them give up the idea that they can be free while making the Negro a slave. They are not required to do much. They are only required to undo the evil they have done, in order to solve this problem.
Let them put away your their race prejudice. Banish the idea that one class must rule over another. Recognize the facts that the rights of the humblest of citizens are as worthy of protection as are those of
17
the highest and your problem will be solved, and whatever may be in store for you them in the future, whether prosperity or adversity, whether you they have foes without or foes within, whether there shall be peace or war, if they live lives based on the eternal principles of truth, justice and humanity, with no class having cause for complaint or grievance, your their republic will stand and flourish forever . . . .""*

Julian Bond appearance to focus nationwide attention on unique Westchester Seminar
WRN Sponsors Seminar to Study Relationships Of Blacks, Newspapers
[headshot] JULIAN BOND
A seminar on the suburban newspaper and its relationship to the black community will be sponsored by the Westminster-Rockland Newspaper Sept. 7-8.
The announcement of the event to be held at the Tappan Zee Inn in Nyack was made today by Thomas P. Dolan, president of WRN.
""This will be an attempt for our editors and reporters to see themselves through the eyes of the black community,"" Dolan said. ""We want a real exchange about our agreements and our differences — both real and imagined.""
Featured speaker for the seminar will be Julian Bond, 31, dynamic Southern black who first gained prominence at the 1968 Democratic National Convention.
Invited to take part in the seminar are a number of black journalists and publishers from across the country, WRN news personnel, some key public officials and members of the black community in this two-county area.
Discussions will cover such topics as housing, employment, education and crime — and their coverage in the press.
Bond was co-chairman of the Georgia insurgent group of Democrats at the 1968 National Cnvention which succeded in unseating the regular delegation. At the same convention Bond was placed in nomination for vice president but withdrew because he was too young to meet the constitutional requirements.
He is a member of the Georgia House of Representatives, but only after three elections and a Supreme Court decision which forced his admission into the House.
He was one of the founders of the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee and help spearhead civil rights drives and voter registration campaigns in the South.
Coordinating the seminar is Warren Jackson, a black business executive in Hartsdale who has had an extensive newspaper background.
Jackson and James Head, executive editor of WRN, will serve as moderators for the seminar.

Serving the New Suburbia [WN logo]
The Westchester Rockland Newspapers are a group of nine dailies and one weekly with a circulation of 225,000 serving the counties of Westchester, Rockland and Putnam, New York. They are members of the Gannett Group, a nationwide chain of 45 newspapers in 12 states with a total circulation of 1.8 million.
The Market
The three predominantly surburban counties served by these newspapers are located on the perimeter of New York City and are considered part of the New York Metropolitan Area. The total population of the three-county market is 1,247,000 of which 404,000 is in the four major cities of Yonkers, White Plaines, Mount Vernon and New Rochelle and the remainder in smaller villages and towns.
The population is diversified as to ethnic group, income and occupation with both wealthy areas and pockets of poverty. On an overall basis, the income of $17,037 per family is far above the average for both the nation and the New York area.
Employment is predominantly in white collar and service occupations, and 70% of all residents work in suburban areas compared to 30% who commute to New York City. Population has levelled off in the major cities but is growing rapidly in upper Westchester, Rockland and Putnam. In addition to residential and shopping areas, an increasing number of major corporate headquarters are located in the area.
The Newspapers
The Westchester Rockland Newspapers are read by 2 out of 3 households in this market, more than all three New York City dailies combined. The individual newspapers are editorially autonomous in the handling of local news but are under central management from group headquarters in White Plains, New York. They are served by a County News Bureau in White Plaines which supplies each newspapers with countywide news as well as national and world news from the Associated Press, Gannett News Service and Los Angeles Times - Washington Port Wire.
The Westchester Rockland Newspapers are at present printed in six plants--all letterpress except a new plant in Rockland where the Journal-News has converted to offset. Printing operations for six Westchester-based newspapers will be consolidated in one of the most completely computerized offset printing plants in the nation scheduled for completion by 1973 in Harrison, New York.

[Picture of Building]
[Caption.]HEADQUARTERS and production plant for Westchester Rockland Newspapers of the Gannett Group will be started this summer on site off the Cross Westchester Expressway.
Six Gannett papers will have showplace of offset printing
Westchester Rockland Newspapers, a division of Gannett Company, Inc., will have a $15 million headquarters and production plant that will be a showplace of offset printing.
Thomas P. Dolan, president of the group, said the building will be designed with data processing as an integral part of the publishing operation. Third-generation computers will be involved in almost every phase of producing six daily newspapers with an aggregate circulation of about 100,000 copies. Dolan, who was publisher of the Plainfield (N.J.) Courier News in the Gannett Group when that paper's new offset printing plant was put under construction on a site away from the core city, made the official announcement of plans to build the Westchester central plant designed by Wigton-Abbott Corp. of Plainfield after the town of Harrison planning board authorized the use of a large tract outside White Plains for printing operations.
The site of the office building and printing plant is on 47.5-acre tract on the Cross Westchester Expressway at the hub of a superhighway network. The property was once owned by the late Whitelaw Reid, publisher of the New York Herald Tribune. Flanking the newspaper buildings are stylish office buildings occupied by IBM and other major corporations.
At the outset the Westchester newspaper will have 14 Goss Metro offset units, capable of printing up to 112 pages at a time, at speeds up to 60,000 copies per hour. The press room is designated to accommodate 36 press units.
Dolan said the newspapers will offer four-color availabilities for both editorial and advertising content and plans for creating a Sunday countywide edition are under intensive consideration.
The six papers to be produced in the headquarters plant are the White Plains Reporter Dispatch, the Port Chester Daily Item, the Mamaroneck Daily Times, the Tarrytown Daily News, the Ossining Citizen Register and the New Rochelle Standard Star.
The buildings now occupied by these papers probably will be placed on the market but each paper will maintain a local sales and news office. They are located in key commercial districts.
Actually the Harrison facility, scheduled to be in operation in two years, is the second phase of the Westchester group's modernization program which was undertaken since Gannett bought the properties in 1964. The first is the new offset plant of the Rockland Journal-News at Nyack, across the Hudson River. Seven Goss Metro units will be in operation there within a few weeks.
The Yonkers Herald Statesman and the Mount Vernon Daily Argus will remain in their present locations and will convert to direct-plate letterpress printing and complete photocomposition within the next two years, Dolan said. A sixth press unit will be installed in the Yonkers plant in December.
In keeping with Gannett policy, Dolan assured, no employe will lose his job in the transition to offset.

Julian Bond, 31, is the dynamic Southern black leader who first gained prominence at the 1968 Democratic National Convention. He was co-chairman of a Georgia insurgent group which succeeded in unseating the regular delegation.
At the same convention, Bond was placed in nomination for Vice-President, but withdrew because he was too young to meet the Constitutional requirements.
He is a member of the Georgia House of Representatives, but only after three elections and a Supreme Court decision, which forced his admission into the House.
He was one of the founders of the Student Non-violent Coordinating Committee and help spearhead civil rights drives and voter registration campaigns in the South."

W. E. B. DuBois correctly stated prph proph stet that the problem of the 20th Century would be the problem of the color line.
In those few words he summed up the crisis that has occupied men and nations, and that has become the first order of business for millions of oppressed peoples.
The roots of the crisis are as old as the world itself; the roots involve the continuing failure of the minority of peoples in this world to share wealth and power with the majority of the world's population .
It is a struggle that has broken out on every college campus; it has been in taken to the streets of most cities in the country, both violently and non violently.
It is a part of the struggle that inspires Cuban cane cutters to overthrow dictators, a part of the struggle that inspires Vietnamese peasants to resist, successfully it seems, 20 years
2
of attempts to dominate their homeland; it is a part of the struggle that inspires Alabama sharecroppers to risk life and limb in order to have a chance at controlling their destiny.
Dr. DuBois believed that scientific and rRational study of the problems of race and class would yeild rational and logical solutions;
[Arrow pointing to the end of the page.]
6 3
[The following are typed pages.]
Civilized man, or educated man, is supposed to solve his problems in a civilised manner. , we have all believed.
But the problems of the 20th Century are so vast that many have quite properly been urged to seek unciviliszed solutions to them. These problems include the poisoning of the air and water; the rape of the land; the new colonialization of peoples, both here and abroad; the new imperialism practiced by Western democracy, and the continuing struggle of those who have not against those who have.
With the birth, two hundred years ago, of the colossus called the United States, rational and educated men began to believe that civiliszation stretched  ] 3 to its highest order had begun. Building on a heritage of revolution, expressing a belief in the equality of most, if not all men, this new democracy was to be the
7 4
highest elevation of man's relations, one to the other, and a new beginning of decency between nations.
Civiliszation, as it was then defined, included imposing limitations on war between nations, encouraging the spread of industrialization, the civilizatinging of so-called heathen elements, the harnessing of nature for the benefit and pleasure of man. It was believed generally that man's better nature would triumph over his base desire to conquer and rule and make war, and that intellect, reason and logic would share equally with morality in deciding man's fate.
Of course it has not been so. Man still makes war, he still insists that one group subordinate its their wishes and desires to that of another, he still insists on gathering material wealth at the expense of his fellows and his environment.

Men and nations have grown arrogant, and the classic struggle of the 20th Century continues.
The educated d peoples of this world have enslaved the uneducated; the rich have dominated the poor; the white minorities have chr crushed the non-white peoples of the globe.
Revolutionary nations — revolutionary 300 years ago — have turned to counter-revolution.
This country, which has visited death on thousands of Vietnamese, has found the arrogance to ignore the centuries of pleading from her own domestic colony, the blacks .
When these pleadings are dismissed, then the problem of the 20th Century comes to the fore, and violence is done to the notion that men can solve their problems

Peace Marchers Hail Bond's View
By MARGARET SHANNON
Atlanta Journal Washington Correspondent
WASHINGTON, May 16 - State Rep.-elect Julian Bond of Atlanta drew applause at a peace rally here Sunday by reading the same statement that led the Georgia House of Representatives to refuse him a seat in January.
Mr. Bond was the first speaker at a program at the Washington Monument after a march in which some 8,000 men, women and children filed by the White House to protest the war in Viet Nam.
Two neatly groomed young women were the only marchers under the Georgia sign in the state-by-state parade. They were Barbara Harkins, a secretary at Quaker House in Atlanta, and Annelies Koopmans, an exchange student from Holland.
As the marchers passed the White House, President Johnson was inside meeting with top advisers on the new crisis precipitated by Premier Nguyen Cao Ky's attack on dissident military-Buddhist South Vietnamese elements in Danang.
THE PEACE PROGRAM was just breaking up at the monument when the President's helicopter soared from the White House lawn into the sunny blue sky, en route to Camp David in the nearby Maryland mountains. He must have had an excellent view of the crowd.
Mr. Bond, a Negro and communications director of the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee (SNCC), contended that the peace movement and the civil rights movement are one.
But the march was predominantly white. There were only a few Negroes among the thousands. It was mainly a nicely dressed, mature crowd.
The young people dressed and coifed in peacenik style were all but lost in a sea of conventionality. The more militant peace groups boycotted the event as too moderate for their tastes.
The rally wound up a two-day convention of the Voters' Pledge Campaign, a movement sponsored by the National Committee for a Sane Nuclear Policy (SANE), the Women's International League for Peace and Freedom, the American Friends Service Committee and others.
The campaign aims at getting people to vote for congressional candidates who advocate a dove-like policy on Viet Nam. Leaders said 73,000 persons have signed pledges to do so.
THERE WAS PROLONGED applause when the rally chairman, H. Stuart Hughes, introduced Mr. Bond as ""twice elected to the Georgia legislature and two times denied his seat because of this outspoken position on the Viet Nam war.""
Mr. Bond was denied his seat once in January. He won a special election to the same post in February, and a move to deny him the seat a second time is now pending before the Georgia House Rules Committee.
Chairman Hughes, a Harvard professor most recently in the news when it was disclosed the State Department put him under survelliance abroad at the request of the FBI, called Mr. Bond ""a living symbol of how the causes of peace and civil rights are one.""
As the Atlanta Negro came to the microphone, the crowd gave him a standing ovation.
Coatless, his shirtsleeves rolled to three-quarter length, his necktie loosened, Mr. Bond said he wanted to read ""the document that put me in the fix I'm in now.""
He read the SNCC statement denouncing the U.S. role in Viet Nam and urging Americans to seek alternatives to the draft.
After the crowd applauded it, Mr. Bond called it ""an ordinary statement that some people might agree or disagree with.""
HE SAID THERE are ""many relationships"" between peace and civil rights.
""Wars kill people, but they also kill ideas and they kill dissent,"" the legislator-elect said.
So, he contended, the war in Viet Nam is damaging the civil rights movement. ""It hurts us and it kills us and it sucks from us the people we hope will help us,"" he said.
The overriding issue in both movements, Mr. Bond said, is ""not that America be made safe for democracy, but that democracy be made safe for Americans—and Vietnamese.""
A statement by Negro integration leader Martin Luther King Jr. of Atlanta, read at the rally, said, ""The pursuit of widened war has narrowed domestic welfare programs, making the poor—white and Negro—bear the heaviest burden both at the front and at home.""
""Another casualty in this war is the principle of dissent,"" the King statement said. ""Efforts to characterize opposition to the war as disloyal or traitorous are themselves destructive of our most fundamental democratic traditions.""
Hundreds of marchers carried signs quoting three senators:
""We are succumbing to the arrogance of power"" — Sen. J. William Fulbright, D - Ark., chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee.
""Escalation breeds escalation"" —Sen. Vance Hartke, D-Ind.
""Admit (the NFL) to a share of power and responsibility"" —Sen. Robert F. Kennedy, D-NY. The NFL is the Viet Cong.
National park police on horseback, motorcycle and foot broke up a scuffle on the fringe of the crowd at the monument when two youths wearing Swastika armbands jumped on a group of New York teen-agers carrying Viet Cong flags during the march.
Norman Thomas, the aging Socialist, and Rev. William Sloane Coffin, Yale University chaplain, are cochairmen of the voters' pledge campaign. Dr. Benjamin Spock, the noted baby care book author and cochairman of SANE, marched at the head of the peace parade.
Miss Harkins said a Southern caucus of the voters' pledge campaign Saturday night discussed plans for action between now and November. The drive has made little headway in Atlanta and Georgia, so far."

The crisis which faces Black schools is simply another visable manifestation of the crisis which has historically faced Black people in this country. Can one really One ought not expect a nation which disrespects the lives and liberties of Black people to give an inkling of respect to the minds of young black students? Can One ought not realistically expect a nation which is never through with killing to take the time or the resources to build viable Black centers for learning? Can we expect a nation which allows the invasion of Guinea to really lift a finger to halt the invasion of Jackson State, or to punish the murderers of Black students at Orangeburg? Can we really expect these things or must we as a colonized people prepare ourselves for more midnight murders and day - light assults?
I used the term colonized people because I feel that the confusion surrounding Black people, and our traditional difficulties with the so-called American way of life stems from our status in this country as a colonial people, and from the fact that we are increasingly being forced to employ the traditional methods and techniques of the colonial subject to escape from the oppression of the colonial
2
power. And These methods and techniques of colonial subjects have historically included the politics of violence.
We have already seen ample evidence of what sort of violence has been visited on the oppressed people of the world for centuries. We are likely to see increasing answers in violence from those who have been on the receiving line all too often.
We need to discover what is and what isn't violent in America.
Violence is Black children going to school for twelve years and receiving five years of education.
Violence is sending your child to college as a maturing Black man or woman and having them him returned to you a full grown Greek.
Violence is having our children educationed or miseducated away from themselves, away from their music, their dance, their religion, their people and often their very souls.
It is violent to tell a man to pull himself up by his bootstraps, especially if you have stolen his boots, boot laces, bootstraps and socks. 
3
Violence is foolish patriotism.
Violence is 30 million hungry stomachs in the most affluent nation on earth.
Violence is a country where property counts more than people.
Violence is an economy that believes in socialism for the rich and capitalism for the poor.
Violence is spending $78 billion to kill and only $12 billion to make whole.
Violence is J. Edgar Hoover listening to your telephone conversations; violence is an Assistant Attorney General proposing concentration camps for white and Black militants; Violence is blowing up two Black men and saying they did it themselves.
Violence is Richard Nixon and Spiro Agnew ignoring the expression of peace of millions of Americans.
We must begin to understand what violence is and we must identify the truely violent members of the American society. This knowledge, this analytical ability, this course in self-
4
preservation has been historically ought to be taught in Black schools. Manifestly with all that can be said, pro and con, and in extinuation, and by way of excuse and hope, Education for Black students in a situation of oppression must be an education for liberation. There is no human way by which this fact can be ignored. We cannot do our daily work, sing a song or write a book or carry on in a university and act as though liberation was not the order of the day.
If this is true then no matter how much we may dislike the statement , the problems of African people must be the center of the Black school. It has got to be. Black educators must teach Black students. There is no use pretending OR wishing that they should teach Chinese, or they should teach white Americans or that they should teach citizens otfehe the world. You should be teaching Black students in 1970 because they are subjects of a violent system in
5
the republic of the United States of American and their problem is primarily the problem of racism.
Black education in this country must begin with Black people. It must muse that variety of the English idiom which we understand; and above all, it is founded or it should be founded on a knowledge of the history of Black people in Africa and in the United States, and their our present condition. Without whitewashing or translating wish into fact, it begins with us; and it asks how can these young gifted and Black men and women best struggle for the liberation of oppressed people.
Black students in 1970 are very similar to Black students of 1960. In a letter to a friend, One Black student described his generation this way, as he wrote to a college friend:
"". . . we are both young, and compared to our elders we are ignorant of many lessons of life. But our
6
youth contains a moral maturity which our elders too often overlook or simply dismiss. Our youthful sensaitive minds invision a world in which injustice, war, exploitation, racism, poverty and disease will become anachronisms. Our generation is a feeling generaltion, not just sensuous, but primarily alturistic altruistic. I constantly awaken in the early hours of the morning hearing the wails of millions. My heart hears the cries of the suppressed in Viet Nam and South Africa, in Harlem and Detroit, in Mississippi and Alabama, and in every country, state, city, village, hamlet or house where injustice rules supreme.""
It is not easy to be ""young, gifted and Black"" in these times and in this country. To exist in such mental chaos is uncomfortable . It seems to be a type of schizophrenia in which one can imagine
7
by day a glorious world striving for perfection and dream that very night of a thousand tearful mothers holding lifeless infants in their own napoalm scorched arms. When ever we are tormented by this dream.. this nightmare, then we should be strengthened by the knowledge that we belong to a glorious people whom Dr. DuBois described as, ""...that Black host to whom discouragement is yet an unwritten word.""
To be young , gifted , and Black then means indeed that ""ours is the quest that's just begun."" Our quest is to make real the Creators plan which is, as Pharoah Saunders said, ""peace and happiness for every man."" How do we reach our goals? What methods must we employ? Individual entrepreneurship has created a class of Black millionaires in publishing, insurance and the cosmetic hair straightening fields, but has done little for the economic uplift of most Black people.
Pressure group politics has won many needed reforms for our race,
8
but these reforms are proving nearly impossible to make secure in colonial society.
The traditional coalitions of Black people, labor, and the more enlightened church leadership have failed in bringing about the beloved society that was dreamed of in the early 60's. The American labor movement hasd begun to show its true colors as Black people began demanding not only labor connected goals like minimum wages, but entry into the craft unions which have always been lily white. The churches have all too often played a gadfly role: Black people today, the war in Vietnam tomorrow, abortion reform the next.
The hoped-for coalition with white college students has failed to materialize, as far too many of this group have shown more interest in boutique radicalism mustsic , drugs , radical groups that began black but have moved from the grey to the gay the romantic rhetoric of revolution and the enobling sacrifice of self-enforced poverty than in the very real
9
problems of existence that afflict most Black people in this country.
So we are left to an ever spiraling scale of politics , and then protest , and then revolt, with the probable result that increasing repression will follow.
Here is a description of the process:
""The people with the fewest illusions about the welfare state are the poor who are served by it. When they protest, usually in the name of American ideals, an interesting reaction follows. Some among the majority react sympathetically, though not always with real understanding of the causes. But a sufficient number of opposing interests are aroused to prevent any drastic change, and often even moderate changes are blocked. The poor, who in most cases begin by politely petitioning their governors, soon take more drastic steps, thinking they can perhaps awaken the conscience of the majority or
10
at least of higher authorities. They do awaken the conscience of some people, and to some extent they force elites to concede token changes. But at the same time, a 'counterrevolution' is triggered against the potential of revolution which has been seen in the mounting protest. The system becomes deadlocked. No more than token reforms, crumbs, result of the protestors. The scale of their protest increases as they realize that appeals to conscience are inadequate. They look for methods of transcending the pressure politics that have not worked. They begin civil disobedience and disruption. The immediate reaction of the power structure is to maintain order. The police are brought into the conflict. Considerations of social, political or economic solutions to be the conflict are gradually replaced by the emphasis on law and order. Violent repression becomes routine.""*
It becomes clear from that analysis that the only escape from this trap is revolution, either violent on the part of both sides of the
11
question, or a revolution in thinking, psychology and political position on at least one side.
It is that second revolution that is bursting upon us today. It springs, first of all, from the Black community. It is a revolution in thinking about ourselves which Black schools have fostered, a revolution turning upside down the perverse analysis that made us -- the victims -- describe ourselves as the causes of our own wretched condition.
It is found most concretely in the growing desire among Black people to reject the kind of tribalization of class and geography that has divided us for so long, and to bring us together as as a colonialized ideological nation within this nation.
It is found in the rejection by Black people of white standards of beauty and qualification and education that have plagued us for so long.
12
But that kind of cultural + psychological revolution will not do the job alone. We may -- as we are slowly about to do -- engage in a relativly nonviolent political revolution take over the major cities of this country and hold them as Black enclaves against increasing repression, charging admission fees to suburban whites who must come to the city for jobs and income, and who must depend on the city as a source of police protection and utility service.
But some we would like to depnd on white majority America as a source of simple decency of treatment, a hope that many would call extremely naive. Some We would like, for example, to be treated as well as American farmers are. First they were given free lands. Then they were given low interest loans to enable them to buy farm machinery. Then the Department of Agriculture sent their farm agents to show them how to use their machines and to rotate their crops. Now we pay them not to do anything, a form of millionaire welfarism that is scorned by poor Black people.
13
Suppose, for example, that an ADC mother was paid not to produce at the same rate that the gentleman farmer Senator James O. Eastland is. That would mean that welfare mothers in Detroit or Chicago or Watts could collect as much as $125,000 each a year for not having babies.
But the revolution demands that we be allowed not more than, but access simply the same as to the same ladders used by other groups. Why, we ask, must patronage be abolished as a political reward when Blacks take over the cities after political favoritism has done so much of for Italians and Irishmen? Why must good government advocatessuggest metropolitanism as a the only panacea to urban ills at a time when we Blacks are about to take over some cities? Why must some women -- most of them white -- and some homosexuals -- most of them white -- and some other groups ,all of them incorrect -- insist that our liberation is dependent upon theirs?
14
The answer must be that no one -- unless it is the American Indian -- has priority over the justifiable demands of Black people. And that only Black people can set the pace, techniques and methods used by Black people in our struggle.
Foremost among these but not exclusively must be political action, but not the old style of machine politics of the unequal Black -- labor -- liberal coalition that we have entered into like a willing bridgegroom so many times in the past, only to emerge ravished and our innocence gone.
Our politics must be an aggressive , independent , politics, free from any alliances of party or partisanship that has made us slaves first to the part of Lincoln (which is not the party of Nixon) and now to the party of Roosevelt (which is also the party of Richard Daily,) We must begin to seize land and power where we are, in the cities and the black belt counties of the old Confederacy. As whites flee these
15
areas for the comfort and security of the suburbs, they create a political vacuum that we must fill.
But the cities are crumbling beneath us, and the presence of a Black mayor alone will not insure that these decaying compounds will be liveable again.
The Black inhabitants of rural America have a better chance at achieving a decent life, for the cost of living is lower there and the people know better how to live, but even these victors will discover that political gains can be destroyed by an economy that still remains in the hands of the European mentality of the plantation bosses. So, as we get our politics together, we must try to get our economics together as well. This means that while we reject the obviously absurd Nixonian notion of Black capitalism, we must not hesitate to accept any communalistic economic advantage that might accrue accure to our group as a whole.
16
This means striving for economic plans as different as the designs plotted by kthe Honorable Elijah Muhammad in the South to the neighborhood cooperatives springing up in ghettoes across the country, to the transfer of mom-and-pop stores from white hands to Black ones; as well as any other plan or scheme that will put money into the pockets of Black people.
It means that we cannot afford the luxury available to so many dilettantes who seek to define for us what is right and what is wrong -- indeed, even what is Black and what is white, in our struggle. At a time when our community seems about to draw together an alliance of cultural nationalists and political activits, of poverty workers and poverty livers, of foot washing Baptists and the Nation of Islam, we cannot afford a pot smoking Woodstock in a nation that still tolerates a death stenched Watts; we cannot demand liberation for special groups
17
until the whole group goes free.
That suggests that the fragile, sometime security of the college campus is not the proper place from which to engage in remote antiseptic criticism of people who seldom see a book from year to year; that the presence of ROTC on the campus is not nearly as earthshaking an issue as the presence of rats in the ghetto; that debates about the relative revisionism of the late Ho Chi Minh had best be neglected until we have started our own revolution here.
Finally, we must prepare for a time of trouble ,and repression if the provisions of the criminally insance Washington, D.C. Crime Act are any indication, or the unwillingness of the House Internal Security Committee to help abolish the concentration camp features of the McCarran Act are a signal for the future, then we had better beware and prepare for hard times and many deaths ahead.
[The ""concentration camp features"" in the previous paragraph are likely referring to the 1950 McCarran Internal Security Act's Emergency Detention Act, Title II; the Emergency Detention Act was repealed in September 1971, after this speech was written.]
Through these hard times, we might prepare ourselves with the
18
words of Frantz Fannon, who wrote how the race problem might be solved. He said then:
""Come now comrades, it would be well to decide at once to change our ways. We must shake off the heavy darkness in which we were plunged and leave it behind. The new day which is already at hand must find us firm, prudent and resolute. We must leave our dreams and abandon our old beliefs and friendships of the time before life began. Let us waste no time in sterile litanies and nauseating mimicry. Leave this Europe where they are never done talking of man, yet murder men everywhere they find them, at the corner of every one of their streets and almost every corner of the globe. For centuries they have stifled almost the whole of humanity in the name of so-called spiritual
19
existence. Look at them today swaying between atomic and spiritual disintegration. Let us decide not to imitate Europe.
Let us combine our muscles and our brains in a new direction. Let us try to create the whole man whom Europe has been incapable of bringing to triumphant birth. Two centuries ago a former European colony decided to catch up with Europe. It succeeded so well that the United States of America became a monster in which the tainsts taints, the sickness, and the inhumanity of Europe have grown to appaling dimensions. It is a question of the third world starting a new history of man. If we wish to live up to our people's expectations we must seek the response somewhere other than Europe.
...We must work out new concepts and try to set afloat a new man.""

20
This is the challenge of Black education in the seventies. And we must not be ashamed of that Black challenge. For as a friend of mine and a native of Greensboro once wrote:
""...Can I help but to shout with joy our beautiful Blackness and the challenge that it offers?
Go tell the groping grass
Frost bitten and pale,
Not to quicken when raised
By the warm summer rains.
But tell me not to whisper or hide my Blackness.
Go tell the proud roosters,
That perch on the trees,
Not to sing loud their praises
To sunshine at dawn.

21
But tell me not to whisper or hide by Blackness. To my generation I promise and to the word world I proclaim:
This beautiful Blackness of mine, I'm gonna let it shine. Let it shine, let it shine, all the time.

No one has to tell a group of people like yourselves a long list of dreamy statistics reminding you of what you already know — that people in this country generally, blac working class and poor people particularly, are ill housed in structures over which they have no control, no control over rent, no control over design, no control over location, and no control over maintenance. 
That is not news to any of you. It ought not tb be t be news to anyone else. 
None of you needs to be told that 27 years after the original promise to provide every American family with a healthful and liveable home, one-sixth of our population still lives in dangerous, sub-standard housing. 
You might want to be reminded, however, of something your president Richard Nixon said earlier this year.
""Of all the services, facilities or other amenities a community provides, few matter more to the individual and his family than the kind of housing he lives in — the kind of neighborhood of which that housing is a part. Through the ages, men have fought to defend their homes; they have struggled, and often dared the wilderness, in order to secure better homes.""
These are wonderful words. It would be wonderful if he meant them.

Julian Bond
Earlier this year, Perhaps inspired by those noble & stirring sentiments, the Congressional Black Caucus, composed of the thirteen representatives in the United States House of Representatives who represent us all, presented a series of recommendations to President Nixon.
Under the topic ""Housing and Urban Development"", they asked for:

$150 million in supplemental funds for public housing;
Implementation of the Uniform Rehabilitation Act to insure an adequate stock of moderate and low income housing for displaced persons;
A uniform policy of site selection for HUD, to avoid reinforcement of housing segregation, and the amendment of Executive Order 11512 to assure that all residential communities are open to all economic and racial groups as a condition of eligibility for location of federal installations.

2
The president's response was long in coming, and when it did come, evasive and to say the least, disappointing to those who waited for it. and vastly different from his earlier call to struggle
No extra monies would be available in supplemental funds. Words, not actions, met the request for housing for displaced low and moderate income Americans. HUD estimated that only 25,000 dwelling units would be available in 1972, or feeer than one city, Washington D.C., could use today.
""...The current state of the nation"" the Caucus said, ""which may be mildly inconvenient to the majority of white America, is for the Black brown, red, and poor... a true crisis which approaches the intolerable. Given this situation, business as usual, bureaucracy as usual, is simply not good enough."" *
Given that statement, it is interesting to note that the history of tenant agitation and organization parallels the history and
3
development of agitation and organization of Black people in this country through the '60s.
As the early sixties saw the birth in the rural South of a new kind of aggressiveness among the people America had thought were too servile and too subdued to protest against their condition in life, the Northern urban poor, living in vertical prisons of concrete and glass, began through tenant organizations, rent strikes, and tenant unions to put flesh on a drive that had been building for many years, the desire of tenants to have something to say about their homes, their rents, their very lives.
Now these two movements — the Southern drive which has turned, in the late sixties and the beginning of the '70s, toward concerted political action, the movement which gave both the direction and the directors of the National Movement of Poor and Black People, and the growing
4
desire of the predominantly Northern working and non-working urban poor to have something to say about welfare rights and tenants rights and people's rights — must come together to insure that future Presidents who receive future requests to do something about the present and future housing needs of poor and Black people will be more receptive than the present president has been.

Before that can be begun, two decisions must be made by all of us. First, we must decide that Richard Nixon and the architects of the National Southern Strategy must go.
Having decided that, it is the method and direction of the removal that must then be agreed upon.
The method in the general sense is through political action, but political action for the poor and unrepresented dispossessed cannot be political action as it operates for other groups of people.
For others, politics may be the art of the possible or the art

There should be a A good demand for you, now, could be for a National Rent Board whose members are 50% tenants to control rents long after the freeze is off.
Just as cost-of-living hearings are held, there should be public hearings held for the poor who always pay more and who always get less.
We know that the less you make, the more you pay. We know that rents and rent raises don't just affect people like us, but to middle income apartment dwellers and students, and wage earners and middl people generally.
Rents ought to be tied to services; if their is no service, let there be no rent. The complaint that triggers federal action ought not come from the tenant who has no heat and light, but from the landlord who can't get an increase in rent.

of compromise: for us, it must be the art of seeing who gets how much of what from whom.
It is interesting also that the great organizations that speak for the poor and struggling in thics country — ranging from the National Urban League to the National Welfare Rights Organization to the Black Panther Party — have all this year indicated an interest in politics, either through nonpartisan voter registration or through actually forming poor people's caucuses at the political conventions next year.
There can be no denying then that the direction Black and poor people must take in the remainder of the 1970s is toward a real and meaningful participation in a new politics.
That is because it is politics that decides, in the end, what kind of life each of us will have, what kind of world we live in, what kind of futures our children will have.

It is politics that decides that we must live in second and third hand homes that others have discarded or in vertical prisons of concrete and glass designed by some architect who lives in the suburbs. It is politics that made it impossible for so many of us to earn a living down home, and ran us into the cities to be squeezed

It is politics that makes us the last to be hired and the first to be fired; that gives our kids twelve years of school but only six years of education; that has made us our young men first in war on the battlefield, but last in peace, and seldom in the hearts of our countrymen.
It is overly ambitious, however, to talk about electing or helping to choose a president if we can't help choose a city councilman back home. We cannot discuss running one Black man, or a Black woman, or developing a Black political platform or agenda if we aren't able to
8
deliver political power on the block where we live.
You here, because of your activity in the struggle for tenants' rights, are superbly suited to enter into the struggle for political parity for the unrepresented. Many of you have done so, and all of us must begin to see the inevitability of the grounding of each separate struggle for homes, for jobs, for freedom, for control in common political action.
That process begins where you have begun, in your building and on your block. It begins by your organizing your neighbors and friends so that when votes are counted, their needs and desires are counted too.
That process multiplied a thousand times by where we happen to be, and how many of us there are can build the basis for change.
The rest of the prescription is spelled out by the Southern Black Caucus, which in mid-summer suggested that Black people stay away from all of the candidates for President of the United States. By all the candidates, I mean all of the candidates.

The face and name of the winner is not nearly as important as what and who the winner is committed to.
Is it the committment going to be public housing in the suburbs, public service employment, increases in wage minimums and in minimum wage coverage, guaranteed social insurance, radically altered public assistance, guaranteed incomes and guaranteed jobs? Will the issues be national health insurance, radically altered federal housing programs, equal employment both racially and sexually, ending the war now, or will it simply be more business as usual? Will we automatically deliver 98% of our votes again to the Democratic Party, as we did in 1964 and 1968, or will we say these votes don't belong automatically to anyone, except to the party and person who will do something for us.
Will the delegates we send to conventions next year be like too many of those in 1968, handpicked by someone else, told how to vote
10
by someone else, voting against us for someone else, or will they be people like yourselves.
And if the party that had to come to us for twenty percent of the vote it did get in 1968 refuses to bargain honorably, will we say we've got noplace else to go, or will we by then have designed a strategy to prepare for that contingency.
Whatever you decide to do, make sure it is something decided by you. Don't let some slick talker like me come to your town or your state and set your political priorities for you. Don't let anyone come to you and tell you they represent you — if you didn't choose them or invite them in, they can only represent themselves.
My argument is simple. It is that politics hold some answers for us. It is that these answere will never develop until we develop our own politics. From where you operate, it may be all-Black politics
11
or coalition politics or any kind of politics of your choosing, but it must be a politics that you can help control, it must be a politics that represents your interests, and it must be a politics that you will never be ashamed of.

It must be a politics that will follow the dictum of Frederick Douglass so many years ago.
Douglass said: ""If there is no struggle, there is no progress. Those who profess to favor freedom and yet deprecate agitation are men who want crops without plowing up the ground. They want the rain without thunder and lightning. They want the ocean without the awful roar of her mighty waters. The struggle may be a physical one, and it may be a moral one, or it may be both moral and physical, but there must be a struggle. Power concedes nothing without a demand. It never has, and it never will . . ..""

It is politics that gives our children lead poisoning, and it is politics that has created socialism for Lockheed Aircraft and welfare capitalism for the poor.
13
It is politics that makes us the last to be hired and the first to be fired; that gives our kids twelve years of school but only six years of education; that has made us first in war on the battlefield, but last in peace, and seldom in the hearts of our countrymen.
But the kind of politics that has done these things to us is not the kind of politics that we must play; our politics must be different and new.
The kinds of politics that have been played on us must not be played by us. This doesn't mean that we must be soft or say no when we want to say yes; it only means that other people's dirty tricks are not for us.
If there is anyone who believes it makes no difference who is President in this country, ask yourself these questions:
Who nominated Carswell and Haynesworth to the Supreme Court
[Typeset changes back to the same from the first pages.]
It is overly ambitious,, however to talk about electing or helping to choose a president if we can't help choose a city councilman back home. We cannot discuss running one black man, or a black woman, or developing a black political platform or agenda if we aren't able to ] 8 deliver political power on the block where we live.
You here, because of your activity in the struggle for tenants rights, are superbly suited to enter into the struggle for political parity for the unrepresented. Many of you have done so, and all of us must begin to see the inevitability of the grounding of each separate struggle in common political action.
That process begins where you have begun, in your building and on your block. It begins by your organizing your neighbors and f iends so that when votes are counted, their needs and desires are counted too.
That process multiplied a tousand times wherever we happen to be, can build the basis for change.
The rest of the prescription is speeld out by the Southern Black Caucus, which in mid-summer suggested that black people stay away from all of the candidates for President of the United States. By all candidates, I mean all of the candidates. ] 9
The faceand the sex and name of the winner is not nearly as important as what the winner is committed to.
Is it going to be public housingin the suburbs, public service employment, increase in wage minimums and in minimum wage coverage, guaranteed social insurance, radically altered public assistance, guaranteed incomes and guaranteed jobs. Wills the issue be national health insurance, radically altered federal housingprograms, equal employment both racially and sexually, or will it simply be more business as usual. Will we automatically deliver 98% of our votes to the Democratic Party, as we did in 1964 and 1968, or will we say these votes don't belong automatically to anyone,except the party and person who will do something for us.
Will the delegates we send to conventions next year be like too many of those in 1968, handpicked by someone else, told how to vote ] 10like by someone else, voting against us for someone else, or will they be people like yourselves.
And if the party that had to come to us for 20% of the vote it did get in 1968 refuses to bargain honorably,will we say we've got noplace else to go, or will we by they have designed a strategy to prepare for that contingency.
What ever you decide to do, make sure it is something decided by you. Don't let some slick talker like me come to your town or your state and set your political priorities for you. Don't let anyone come to you and tell you they represent you — if you didn't choose or invited them in, they can only represent themselves.
My argument is simple. It is that politics hold some answers for us. It is that these answers will never develop until we develop our own politics. From where you operate, it may be all-black politics ] 11 or coalition politics or any kind of politics of your choosing, but it must be a politics that you can help control. It must be a politics that represents your interests, and it must be a politics that you will never be ashamed of.
It must be a politics that will follow the dictum of Frederick Douglass so many years ago.
Douglass said: ""Men may not get all they pay for in this world, but they certainly must pay for all they get. If we are ever to be free from the oppression and wrong that is heaped upon us,we must pay for their removal through our struggle, and sacrifice, and if need be by our lives, and the lives of others.
Douglass said: ""If there is no struggle.…."

[The previous quotes indicate to repeat the above phrasing, with the intended phrase as: define our enemies.]
[The first several pages have faint typeset that becomes clearer mid-document.]
Let us grant, then, that things have gotten better, in some ways, for some of us.
We can now eat in places where we never ate before. We can now sleep in places where we never slept before. We can vote in places where we never voted before.
And if we have lived outside of the states of the old confederacy, we can work and live and learn in places where we never worked or lived or learned before.
But for any most of us, things are just the same or worse.
We had believed that by winning the vote, great doors would open. And these doors have opened for some of us, or most of us here tonight would not be here.
We believed that when legal segregation had ended, we would join the Jews, the Irish-Americans, the Italian-Americans in being "" assimilated"" into American culture.
From the days when we were forced to believe that ""white is right"" we have come to the day when — we are told once again — if we act ""white"", then we will be right. We were told that if we could adopt the habist and customs of the majority of peoples in this country then we would be accepted by them, could equally compete with them and receive equal rewards from our participation in the greater society.
For instance, some sociologist and even our president; now tell us that if we can solve our family problems — and they somehow suggest that we caused these problems ourselves — then we will be on our way toward ""assimilation"".
But to suggest that our broken homes, our lack of family structure, our matriacial society is caused by us is to discover that America has begun to play the dozens with us. Well they can stop talking about my mama, and your mama, and begin to tell us what we need to hear.

Nowt that Alabama now has a Negro sheriff, but that the average black Alabamian has only a sixth grade education.
Not that Negroes in Sunflower County can vote, but that nearly 100,000 black Mississippians have jobs have no jobs, no schools, no food to eat.
Not that Senator Edward Brooke has been elected by all of the people of Massachusetts, but that Lester Maddox and Lurlee Wallace are still, and probably for a long time still will be with us.
We must always remember that for most of us, times are still hard, and life is still not a chrystal stair.
Seventeen years ago, more than a fourth of all of us lived on farms. Seven years ago the figure was 8 per cent; in three years, in 1970, it will probably be 45 4%.
We at one time though that once in this country's great cities, Negroes would follow the route that other immigrant groups had taken, brief and brutal segregation, and then gradual assimiliation.
But the events of the last few years show this assumption to be false. What has happened is that we have replaced these other groups as the lowest group on the ladder to success, and have given them the ability to each move up one step.
Thus we see the contradiction in the knowledge that a Negro living in Chicago today is better off than his grandfather might have been, but no better off in his relationship to white Chicagoans.
For instance, in the rural South, Negroes earn less than 45 per cent of the average wage that a rural white white man makes. In a city like Atlanta, the average Negro wage-earner makes half of what his white counterpart earns, while a northern Negro worker makes less than 70 per cent of what whites can expect to make.

So we see developing across this country, as Southern barriers are erased, and end to caste, or racial segregation, and the entrenchment of class and racial segregation.
While some cities try to end de facto segregation, the numbers of Negro children attending all-Negro schools North of the Mason - Dixon line is increasing.
While a few Negroes move into the suburbs, they discover they move into what will some become an all-Negro suburb and next a suburban slum.
The difference between the Southern style that is fast ending is that the new style does allow for some of us, if we possess the training and skills and behavior acceptable to the majority we can to rise, we can to assimilate.
But thousands and millions of us do not have have these skills, do not have the education, and do not want any pattern of behavior that reflects so badly on its practioners, that style of middle class, middle mind, middle brow, middle of the road life that stifles what it touches, that kills what it embraces.
If we assume that money and goods and services in this country are going to be distributed always the ways they are today, then we are in sad shape.
The Irish immigrants in this country were pushed up the ladder by the Italians and Jews, and Italians and Jews by Negroes. The Anglo-Saxon Protestants who first arrived on these shores stopped looking down on the Irish when the Italians came along, and the Irish lost interest in persecuting Italians when we came along.
Now unless we expect to — or hope to — begin to look down on another group, we are stuck.
Our alternative, under the present system, is to hope for the sort of equality that appears to be open to us, an equality that means an equal chance to be poor, an equal chance to live in a slum, an equal chance to go to a bad school, an equal chance to be out of work.

In fact, a Negro leader told me that we ought to, as a group of people support the war in Vietnam because for the first time we have equalitt in the Army. I told him that if he means that giving a Negro soldier two and one-half times the chance to die is equality, that that's too much of a good thing.
Obviously, none of us wants an equal chance at the bad things this country has. We have had for hundreds of years a better-than-average chance at badness, and now demand more than just a chance t at the good things.
Some Most of us here begun to choose ""political"" ways to make that choice. Not because we say that picket lines are no good, or that demonstrations can't do it, or that law suits won't work, but because we think that people in a desperate situation need to try any and every method to solve their problem.

[The typeset becomes darker and more clear starting on this page.]
These assumptions, born through the five years of futility that reach back from 1966, come from The reason is the civil rights movements failure to improve in any appreciable manner the condition of the Negro masses.
Nearly six 7 years of sit-ins, lie-ins, march-ins and the beginning of vote-ins have not yet begun to properly feed or employ those Negroes and whites who are daily rejected by a swiftly mechanizing South and an increasingly ghettoized North.
Those Southern — and Northern — Negroes who fought long and hard for the right to eat stale hamburgers served by sullen waitresses in lunch counters across the region discovered to their dismay that those at Joe's Chicken Shack were twice as good and often half as expensive.
Those students who braved death and brutality for five years across Mississippi and Alabama and the rest of the rebel states fighting for the simple right to cast a ballot discovered that the political system offered them only a choice to cast that vote for one racist or another.
And through it all, they all discovered — the students organizers, white and black and the suffering Negro poor of the deep South's mouldering farm lands — that the national government either had no interest in or deemed it politically in-expedient to offer any but the most minimal assistance to people struggling to enjoy those rights granted without question to any other person who sets foot on this soil.
That their sense of outrage at the unwillingness of the national government to extend its protection to its citizens should become vocal, and should become increasingly critical of other aspects of this country's policies, at home and abroad, should be no surprise.
Those Americans — particularly those who count themselves as ""friends of the movement — who expressed shock and dismay at the stands of SCEF the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee, the Congress of Racial Equality and the Southern Christian
6
Leadership Conference at the immoral and illegal conduct of this nation in Southeast Asia should have been more familiar with their history.
Black men — that is to say militant black men — have for years voiced their opposition to what they considered wrongs committed in and by America. It was in 1841 when a Negro newspaper asked the rhetorical question:
""If war be declared, shall we fight with the chains on our limbs? Will we fight in defense of a government which denies us the most precious right of citizenship? We ask these questions. The states in which we dwell have twice availed themselves of our voluntary services, and have repaid us with chains and slavery. Shall we a third time kiss the foot that chruses us? No!

And those Negroes today to who oppose the war in Viet Nam are merely echoing the words of the a Negro man who preceded me, in 1868, into the lower House of the legislature of the state of Georgia. He said then:
""The black man cannot protect a country, if the country doesn't protect him; and if tomorrow, a war should arise, I would not raise a musket to defend a country where my manhood is denied. I will say this much to the colored men of Georgia... Never lift a finger nor raise a hand in defense of Georgia, unless Georgia acknowledges that you are men, and invests you with the rights pertaining to manhood.""

That man's name was Henry McNeill Turner. He, like me, lost his seat in the Georgia House of Representatives.
But these two criticisms, while well founded, confused then — and would confuse today — many of those whose opposition to that war — and other wars like it — rests on other grounds.
""While it is true,"" they say ""that Negroes are not granted full rights here, would it not be better to fight for America and then demand your rights or at least oppose the war because it is wrong there, and not because we are wrong here.""
7
This feeling has a long tradition in the black community.
But those who mount this criticism of opposition to the war in Viet Nam on racial grounds should listen to criticism of an earlier war of imperialism fought by this country. It came Other anti-war sentiment from Frederick Douglass in 1848 on the occasion of the ending of the war with Mexico.
""In our judgement, ""Douglass wrote, ""those who have all along been in favor of a vigorous prosecution of the war, and heralding its bloody triumphs with apparent rapture, and glorifying the atrocious deerds of barbarous heroism on the part of wicked men engaged in it, have no sincere love of peace, and are not now rejoicing over peace, but plunder.""
""They have succeeded in robbing Mexico of her territory, and are rejoicing over their success under the hypocritical pretence of a regard for peace.""
And fifty years later, his son, Lewis Douglass, when speaking of another war with racial overtone, declared:
""The question will be asked: How is it that such promises are made to Filipinos thousands of miles away while the action of the administration in protecting dark citizens at home does not even extend to a promise to rebuke the outlawry which kills American citizens of African descent for the purpose of gratifying blood-thirstiness and race hatred? It is hypocrisy of the most sickening kind to try and make us believe that the killing of Filipinos (we might substitute here Vietnamese) is for the purpose of good government and to give protection to life and liberty and the pursuit of happiness. It is a sorry, through true fact, that wherever this government prevails controls, injustice to dark races prevails. The people of Cuba, Puerto Rico, Hawaii and Manila know it as well as do the wronged Indian and outraged black men in the United States.…"" [The italicized content in the previous paragraph appears in the manuscript in red typeset; the editors added the italics to simulate this difference.]

But it was left to W. E. B. DuBois to make a clear connection between wars of conquest fought against wars of national liberation in 1904:
""I believe in the Prince of Peace,"" DuBois wrote. ""I believe that war in
8
murder. I believe that armies and navies are at the bottom the tinsel and braggadacio of oppression and wrong; and I believe that the wicked conquest of weaker and darker nations by nations white and stronger but foreshadows the death of the strength.""
What then , are those people in the civil rights movement who believe that racism and discrimination must end, and those people in the peace movement who believe that war — particularly this war — must end, and what must those people who connect racism at home with imperialism abroad, what are these people to do?
[The following paragraphs have a pattern of notations. The three quote blocks have handwritten squares drawn around them. And the last two quote blocks have phrases in red typeset that the editors have indicated with italics. See images.]
They may take a cue from an statement by a meeting of Abolitionists in 1837 who declared:
""...we have not as yet rec discovered any sincerity in any party, therefore as abolitionists we deem it our duty to stand aloof from all political parties, and will be careful to give vote for no man or party who will not give his influence in favor of (our purposes)"".
And they may heed the worsds of the former Acting-Governor of Louisiana, P. B. S. Pinchback, who was reported to have told a meeting in 1875:
""...he would not advise any separate political organizations; but as the Irish and German citizens of this country had their organizations for the promotion of their mutual interests, Negroes (and we may substitute here ""those who believe in peace and civil rights) must consolidate their efforts and work together for a common purpose.""
And while part of of any new coalition must be free to experiment with new ways of making political dents in the system while other parts of it — as I have done — still buttt their heads along the established paths, it must remember the words of Thomas Fortune in 1884:
""That party (the Republican party) stands today for organized corruption, while its opponent stand for organized brigandage. The black man, who was betrayed by his party and murdered by the opponents of his party, is absolved from
9
all allegiances which gratitude may have dictated, and is today free to make doconditions the best possible with any faction which will insure him his right to life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness.""
[There are three handwritten lines in the left margin along the first, third, and fourth paragraphs on the page.]
So how, then, may these two forces — the struggle for human rights in this country and the struggle for human life in Viet Nam — come together?
The obvious points of referenceffor the two movements are the adherance in both movements of some of the members of each group to the doctrine of non-violence and the suggestion that war and violent conflict can no longer be used by men to settle dispites.
But those on both sides of the lines in the civil rights movement who believe in the theory and practice of nonviolence seem to be shrinking. What then of those who believe that the civil rights movement demands more than love for the oppressor and the oppressed and ro what road for those in the peace movement who support a war to drive out agressors, not the imaginary agressors from Hanoi but the real interlopers from America?
These forces must bend the assumptions made earlier by the civil rights movement to fit their own situation. They would say then that — our social system, as organized, is no longer capable of solving, through normal channells, the urgent problems — in this case the war in Viet Nam poverty and racism  — presented to it by history.
For the peace movements, normal channells have been letter-writing campaigns, support for congressional doves, week end lobbying trips to Washington and the occassional massive march on the nation's capitol. Secondly, we must assume: 
- that the social system, as organized, is part of the problem, and cannot be appealed to or relied upon as an independent arbiter in power conflicts in which it is a part.
This means, I believe, that to assume that the the President Johnson of today and the Senator Johnson of yesterday who opposed (in his words) ""sending American
10
GIs on a blood-letting spree to perpetuate colonialism and white man's rule exploitation in Asia"" are not the same man is to make a basic mistake. Then he opposed ""perpetuating colonialism"" and would probably oppose it, verbally, now. But to ask him to end, out of conscience or moral feeling to end this war is like asking a bull not to run at a red flag.
Thirdly, we must assume: [Much of this material is paraphrased from Lerone Bennett, Jr.'s 1964 book, The Negro Mood.]

that wars are not fought for the fun of it, but the function of wars are to defend social, economic, political or psychological interests, and that appeals to the fair play of war-minded people are prayers said to the wind.
that nations stop making war if they are forced to make a clear out choice between war and another highly developed value — economic gain, internal peace, or some oc political stability.

Since we are not ready to rush to the barricades and since Lyndon Johnson does not own a candy factory we might all boycott, we must attack his third flank, his desire for political stability.
In doing so, we come to the latter assumptions of the peace civil rights movement and bend them to our own ends. We assume and declare:

since peace and civil rights people ""appear"" to be in a minority in the United States, we must make allegiances and alliances based on their ability to promote our goals. In general, the so-called allegiiances between ""us"" and ""them"" do not serve our interests. They are ad hoc arrangements to insure a liberal vote for certain politicans.
we must avoid marriage to any political group, and most importantly now, must avoid marriage to any fresh horse who changes colors overnight and now seems to ride the way we like to see horses ridden. Particularly if these horses keep stables in Massachusetts, New York and Washington.
(most importantly) we must initiate and support massive programs of political , peace , and civil rights education.

When our candidates falter, as they some have, we must continue to build, so the anti-war state legislative candidate a year from now may benefit from the labors of the anti-war congressional candidate last summer. We must build a base, an active, democratic base, from which must come a constantly emerging and militant leadership.
— finally, we must not forget our issues. For if we forget them,s them, we in effect allow the system political order to sanctify the established system that excludes us from participation and consideration.
We must remember that elective politics is not the only way, but it is a way. No one can say tell today the effect of last summer's peace candidates on this country's politics (except Time magazine).
But one thing is sure. They have begun to tie together the two movements — for peace and civil rights — and will not rest until each is a reality. Peace cannot exist until every man enjoys his rights. No man will enjoy his rights until all men are done with war.
We must remember that America is in the exporting business. She is now trying to export American democracy to Viet Nam. We must organize so we can say that the world must not be made safe for Democracy, but that American democracy must be made safe for the world.

For most Negro Americans, politics and politicians carry a taint. The taint comes from centuries of sell-outs, from broken promises and pledges, from the violation of oaths, the disregard of platforms and public declarations.
The taint is well earned. It is not the purpose of this discussion to argue that politics is pure or that politics is the only or even that politics is the best method of solving the white problem in America.
Here I intend to suggest that properly practiced, politics can win rewards. Properly applied, political pressure can pave streets, get garbage picked up, make schools better, bring jobs to the jobless and homes to the homeless.
It should not be assumed that politics will solve every social ill, or even attempt to rectify three and one-half centuries of brutality and insensitivity. It sould not be assumed a Stokes in Cleveland or Hatcher in Gary make livfe immediately more liveable for the black citizens of those cities.
It should be assumed, however, that we have not tried politics as we should, and it should be assumed that politics for us ought to mean the art of deciding who gets how much of what from whom.
Given that definition, and the restrictions mentioned above, politics ought to attract those of us interested in making mean for us a chance — and a good chance —
2
of having something to say about what is being done to us. It is no more than that and no less; a hand in the solution of the white problem in America.

With the elections of Richard Hatcher in Gary, Indiana and Carl Stokes in Cleveland, Ohio, there is a great deal of speculation about political potentials for Negroes across the nation.
A survey conducted by Mrs. Almena Lomax in her magazine, the Tribune, estimated that fair elections and proportional representation based on one-man — one vote, would give Negroes 61 additional congressional seats. Mrs. Lomax estimates that Her estimates are of course based on the assumption that in addition to being fair and proportional, the elections of 1968 will find Negroes in all of the states of the United States in a condition unlike any condition we have ever approached before — the condition of being unified across lines of party and race class.
The lack of unity that frustrates Negro political aspirations has its roots in 100 years of dealings with the most frustrating of all the arts, the art of politics.
4
Almost 100 years ago, a Negro Georgian wrote about the political and a political prospects and a political program for Negroes in the United States.
""The black man, who was betrayed by his party and murdered by the opponents of his party, is absolved from all allegiances which gratitude may have dictated, and is today free to make conditions the best possible with any faction which will insure him in his right to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.""
In the years since then, his brothers in the South discovered — until recently — that politics was not for them. For 100 years, North and South, East and West, Negroes have been caught between the definitions of politics that declare politics is the art of the possible and the art compromise. For Negroes, the compromise has been the compromise of his right to live, and the possible has been for him the realization that under present politics, most things are impossible.
A writer in the 1960s Lerone Bennett has described the Negro's situation as radical, and his usual means of seeking redress — the art of politics — as a moderate solution. Thus, he writes, the ""black man has been condemned to seek radical ends within a political framework which was designed to prevent sudden and radical social and economic changes.""
For above all else, politics is the art practiced by insiders for insiders on behalf of other insiders. And North and South, East and West, the America Negro

has always been an outsider.
It would be better to let Mr. Bennett's words speak for him here. He asks:
Lerone Bennett
""Is politics relevant to our contemporary crisis which cannot be resolved without political programs of depth and dimension never before attempted in America? Is the politics relevant to the issues of bread for the millions and housing and education for the poor? Is politics relevant to the question of the redistribution of income and the restructuring of the fundemental institutions of this society.? Is politics relevant to black reality? Beyond all that, beyond the specific problems of black people, we must ask whether politics is relevant to white people? Is it relevant to the emptiness and hysteria and the unresolved social and economic problems in the white community? Watts and Newark and Detroit put these questions on the agenda of American life. In a very real sense, these rebellions were devastating critiques of the American Way of Politics. In rebellion, the black people of America said they were voting more and enjoying it less.""
The history of the involvement of American Negroes with politics is not a very bright one. It is a history of a virtual castration of all Negro political life in the South and the building of white-controlled black political colonies in the big cities of the North and West.
Throughout this history, black men have played the dual role of actors and the acted-upon for manipulators of black communities. The Negro as a political animal has had little to do with politics from the inside; as a creature of action, action often violent and bloody, he has managed some slight shoves toward entering
333333 6
the political system and becoming a small, small part of the inside.
When black men first came to this country, we faced a system that allowed certain advances won by ambition and hard work. Some of us owned land and slaves. We lived and worked with whites throughout the 13 colonies, and voted in eleven of them.
But the introduction of slavery by race — instead of slavery by class — ended what might have become the first and only interracial democracy in the West. And tThrough the entire period of slavery, we became the acted upon instead of actors inside the political system.
The is not to say the we did not vote for we did without casting ballots. The presence of this dark, looming mass, poised dangerously near every white family in the Southern region at least, poised presented an overwhelming reminder that the politics of that era must by nature have been repressive, arbitrary and discriminatory not only against the blacks who were completely excluded but against the poor whites, the majority white population of the Southern states, who were as effectively cut out of politics as though none had ever held a ballot in his hands.
We might also say that such men as Nat Turner and Denmark Vesey voted too; silently, swiftly in the dark of night, voted their violent dissaproval of a political system whose ghosts still haunt us today.
44444 7
The Civil War broke this pattern for a second; the Reconstruction Era that followed marked the first — and in fact only — real political participation by black men in politics in a meaningful way.
In the beginning, black men were again the acted upon, recipients of the benefits of the 14th and 15th Amendments and th a Civil Rights Act which makes those discussed and defeated in Congress today appear like tissue paper dreams in comparison.
But while Reconstruction gave the South its free public schools and instituted many other reforms, it escaped the economic reforms revolution that could have meant , 100 years later, a quiet summer for residents of Watts, Detroit and Newark.
Instead, Reconstruction gave us the most infamous use of politics as the art of compromise — the compromise of 1877 — the high point in dirty deals which gave Rutherford B. Hayes the presidency in return for the nation turning its back on the helpless, hopeful Negro citizens of the South. Inside ] page 7 ten years, they were still helpless, not quite so hopeful, and no longer citizens.
Again, in the years following Reconstruction, Southern black men voted without votes — this time with their feet. The swelled into the cities of the North and West, building — and having built around them — black ghettoes that 75 years later, in 1965 and 1966 and 1967 are beginning to explode exploding with all of the
8
force and misery built up over 75 years.
For Reconstruction had worked, for a while, for ten years. It had held out the promise that the American drea dillemna could be resolved and that the American dream could come true.
When those ten years ened ended, a dream had been deffered. And the late Langston Hughes wrote that a dream deferred is like a raisin in the sun — it will fester, then explode.
As dillilusioned Negroes by the tens of thousands arrived in Detroit or Chicago or New York, they saw a certian sort of politics beckoning. It was a politics of machines and a politics of favors, a politics that allowed black men to operate — but not to control — their own communities.
Despite this machinery, the machinery that has produced the most entrenched and the most corrupt of all Negro politicians, a sort of politics that
666666 9
made black voters partial actors again, there were some gains. When Negroes made the big shift from the Republican to Democratic party with the New Deal, individual Negro politicians began to flex their muscles. It seemed as though the temper of American had changed. The Supreme Court declared segregation was illegal. The Negro vote in the South peeked out on the world again, and what we then belived was a second rReconstruction had begun.
But we soon discovered that whilet things had vastly improved for some few of us, for most of us they were the same or worse.
Listen to President Johnson describeding the plight of America's Negroes in 1965:
[The following two paragraphs have a blue-ink line around the perimeter, creating a square-like shape.]
""In 1948, 9 the President said, ""the ra 8% uemployment rate for Negro teenage boys was actually less than that of whites, By 1864, the rate had grown to 23 agen per cent, as against 13 per cent for whites. Between 1949 and 1959, the income of Negro men relative to white men declined in every section of the country. From 1952 to 1963, the median income of Negro families compared to white actually dropped from 57 per cent to 53 per cent. Since 1947, the number of white families living in poverty has decreased 27 per cent, while the number of poor nonwhite families decreased only 3 per cent. The infant mortality of nonwhites in 1940 was 70 per cent greater than whites. In 1962, it was 90 per cent greater.""
To use President Johnson's figure, the rate of unemployment for Negroes and whites in 1930 was about the same. in 1965 (two years ago), the Negro rate was twice as high.
7777777 10
I submit that President Johnson's figures reflect something that Negro voters in big cities have realized for years — that present day politics is a failure for them. Present day politics has done more than allow conditions to worsen for Negroes — it has in fact encouraged a worsening while telling Negroes — and the nation — things we don't need to hear.
We don't need to know, for instance, that all of the voters of Massachusettes have elected a very Negro Senator. What we need to know is that nearly 100,000 Negro Mississippians in 19678 are without jobs, income, food, clothing and shelter.
We don't need to know, for instance, that Alabama has elected a fine Negro sheriff, but we need to remember that Alabama's white-face version of Beulah and Tom still rule that state. (I might add that Alabama presents a perfect exambple of the old saying that politics makes strange bedfellows — except in this case, bedfellows make are making strange politics)
I We don't need to know that Negroes can sleep where they never slept, eat where they never ate, and sit in the front of busses that never even used to stop. I do need to know that the infant mortality rate is greater in central Harlem than it is in Saigon, a statistic that makes one wonder which babies are most important to whom.
In the middle sixties, we find several forces operating on the American
11
We do need to know we still can't work where we now can sleep, we can't pay the bill at some of the places we are now allowed to eat in, and that can't get a union job in the factory that makes the bus we are now allowed to sit the in front of.
We all need to know that as the numbers of Negro officeholders increases, so does the number of Negro jobless.
We need to know that as Negroes press toward the polling add their names to the registration lists in the South, their names are struck from the lists of those elgigible for a job, a house, an education or simply simple welfare relief.
We need to know that while black America slides down a hill that white America is climbing fast, the government of the richest and most powerful nation on earth cannot give the time, money willingness or energy to discover a solution to oits most pressing problem.
We need to examine the relationship between a nation's treatment of its black poor, treated like objects of study, of inspection, of condemnation, and its treatments of other poor dark objects in other nations where others groups cry out for freedom.
In the middle sixties, these dark objects are losing whatever objectivity they ever had about their position and the reasons their position is worsening.
Without conducting a survey, one may be sure that Negroes are not poor and jobless because their family life is in dissaray disrepair. That theory is simply the co-opting of a favorite street corner game, the dozens, and requires an answer
12
in kind: we are poor not not poor because of our mamas, but because or their mamas and papas haved played the dozens with us for over 400 300 years.
What can the future hold for us, if we choose to attack our problems with political means?
Can we assume that the compromise of 1967 has already been made, and that Lyndon B. Johnson and has repeated Rutherford B. Hayes' surrender to the South?
Or ought we not examine what our situation is, discover where we are and where we will be in 10 or 15 years, and begin to behave in a manner calculated to give us the maximum political relief.
We have become, with the rest of America, an urban population. In Washington, DC, where we can't elect even a dogcatcher, much less a mayor, we are over 60% of the population. In To mention a few cities — Richmond, Nashville, New Orleans, Jacksonville and Birmingham, Negro populations are over 40%.
Atlanta will have a Negro majority soon, but like the city fathers in Nashville and Jacksonville and countless other near-black-majority cities, this political potential is being diluted through city-county mergers, removing real power from the Negro bloc until the
99999999 13
the Negro birth rate catches fast expanding municipal limits.
[Nationally] Compton, California, Gary, Indiana, Baltimore, St. Louis, Newark, Detroit and Trenton will have near majority Negro populations by 1970.
To understand what these figures do not mean, one must understand what life in the ghetto of Newark, or Baltimore, or Trenton must mean in 1967 and in 1970.
Dr. Kenneth Clark has described it well:
""The dark ghettos, ""Clark writes, ""are social, political, economic, political educational — and above all — economic colonies. Their inhabitants are subject people, victims of the greed, cruelty, insensitivity, guilt and fear of their masters.""
The term ""colony"", then will
The rems terms ""colony"" and colonialized people"" will then correctly described the condition of those millions now who even today are deserting the mechanized agricultural feudal system of the South for the more high mechanized — and more highly segregated, under in a sophisticated way — ghettos of the North and West.
From these colonies must come a new politics, if politics is to be the method these millions choose.
We ought to remind ourselves here of the method an earlier colony on these shores took to free itself from oppression — that method was armed rebellion, insurrection, seizure of property, death and destruction, — a pattern some have seen , the American way of 1776.

Will it be peaceful politics or violent protests?
repeated in the long, hot summer of the sixties.
Hoping and assuming that that method will not in fact be repeated won't make it so, but for the sake of today's projections into the future, let us make that assumption, the assumption that the political method will might will be a peaceful, more orthodox one.
[A blue-ink link appears between these paragraphs.]
Let us see what political prospects can be learned by looks into the past.
A Negro runs for mayor of Gary, Indiana. Eminently qualified, opposing a lackluster political machine operated by hoodlum students hoodlums and thugs, he is rebuffed by his party, accused of injecting racism into the campaign, and forced to raise funds outside of his city.
A Negro runs for mayor of Cleveland, Ohio. Again he his highly qualified, possesses a recodrrd of progress his opponent cannot match, but narrowly sueaks into squeaks wins the general election with only 12000 20% of the white votes.
A Negro runs for mayor of Memphis, Tennessee. Again, he is qualified, possessing an admiral record in his state's legislature, but is defeated in the primary when members of his own community decide that what white people have told them for so many years must be correct — Negroes have never done, therefore this Negro can't do.
15
Negroes win several seats in a Southern legislature. In fighting within the Negro delegation coupled with tThe complete refusal of white legislators to extend any cooperation frustrates their every attempt to promote progressive legislation.
11 11 11 11 11 11 16
A Negro congressman, with a legislative record of progress and liberalism that wins the praises of two presidents, is caught performing acts that make him appear as a sticky fingered saint in a lions den den of thieves. A collection of known alcholo men whose own affairs would if lightly studied bear crumple like paper houses take upon themselves the right heretofore reserved for the electorate alone to decide that this man cannot sit in Congress's hallowed halls.
A Negro city councilwoman in the enlightened Northwest introduces a fair houses housing bill before her council four times. Each time, her vote is the only one that keeps it from being unanimously defeated. Frustrated, she joins Negro militants in street demonstrations, is arrested and jailed.
Will these patterns be repeated when Negroes in Shreveport, Oakland, Chattanooga, Camden, Kansas City and a host of other cities really flex their political muscles? Will there be established a pattern so familiar to all American cities Negroes, the pattern that allows gives us Jackie Robinson to hit home runs for all Negroes who whose race — not their talent kept them out, that allows gives us Ralph Bunche to sit in a position of prominence for all Negroes who whose skin, not their lack of intelligence, kept then out, a pattern that claims gives us Edward Brooke to get elected for all Negroes who whose race, not their politics or platform kept them out?
That pattern is a mix of the saying that once spelled the difference between race relations North and South — in the Sout North, you could get as big as
12 12 12 12 12 12 17
you wanted to but not too close, and in the South, Negroes could get as close as they wanted to, but not too big. Today's pattern allows Negroes to push as hard as they wish, but does not allow resistance to slacken in proportion to the amount of the demand.
In the Southern part of the United State, where for some reason, most good things come from, there are several experiments being conducted with politics by Negroes.
The oOne, in Mississippi combines the has separated Negroes from the all-white state Democratic party in favor of ties with the national Democratic party. The national party has refused in Atlantic City four years ago to accept this gift of Negro votes and Negro favor, and there is some question in my mind about as to how long the hand of friendship will be extended.
The other experiment is in Lowdnes County, Alabama, where independent politics are beginning to have real meaning. The Lowdnes County Freedom Organization, known perhaps in the style of the popular press to most of you more popularly as the original Black Panther party, can has hopefully begin to make a real dent on a political structure that has surved survived Kissing Jim Folsom and is starting is its second dose of Wallaces.
Neither of these two experiments can be expected to be transferred, wholesale, to other Negro communities in other regions of the United States. But both
18
examples do speellout what a popular song has called the theory of ""different strokes for different folks.""
That theory is that American Negroes, in spite of their being subjected to the same discrimination and hardships, are different folks. We have our Republicans and Democrats and Independents and too many of our own Facists.
We have our communities which apparently have never heard the news of Lincoln's assasination, and have voted Republican ever since his Presidency, and our communities — North and South — where voting is still ""white folks business.""
We have our communities where political gains could be won tomorrow, if we ever got the courage to fight white people as successfully as we fight ourselves.
And we have our political leaders who, through frustration or greed, have decided that politics is for them the art of fooling all of the people all of the time.
If a new sort of politics, a black politics (as offensive as that may be to some Negroes) springs from the active protests and organizing drives of the early sixties, it must be first of all (small ""d"") democratic. It must extend to every member of the Negro community the opportunity to have a say in who gets what from whom. It must casts its votes in a unit, it must deal with problems on a local, regional national and international basis, and it must decided that freedoms not enjoyed in Watts or Sunflower County cannot be enjoyed in West Chester County.
19
It must declare itself in the interests of laboring people, but not become the servent mistress of organized labor.
It must pay as much attention to a street light in an a 50-foot alley as it does to national legislation involving millions of people, and international complications involving the future of the world.
It must maintain a militance and an agressiveness that will earn it the respect of those it challenges.
20
If there are any rules peculiar to Negro participation in politics, they are these:

1. that social, economic, educational, political and physical segregation and discrimination fill a very real need for the white majority;
3. that positions of segregation and discrimination will be adhered to until change becomes is forced through coercion, threats, power or violence.
2. that appeals to justice and fair play are outmoded and useless when power, financial gain and prestige are at stake;
4 5. that the geographical distribution of Negroes makes Negro - white coalitions desireable, but only when based on racial self-interest and genuine equality between the coalescing groups; but
3. 4. that initiative for black political education and organization must come from within the Negro community and must be sustained on a day-by-day basis; and
6. that racial self-interest race consciousness and racial solidarity must always be paramount in the deeds and words of the black political animal; when self-interest is forgotten, organized racism will continue to dominate and frustrate the best intended organized political actions of any black political unit, and will leave it powerless and defenseless.

21
Black politics must address itself to solving America's white problem, to developing a new sophistication and consciousness in the black and white communities, and to making democracy safe for the world.
Peaceful protests — and the blooded bloodied heads of annonymous thousands — have won the lunch counter seat, the bus station bench, the integrated toilet and the vote. The vote and concentrated, united political action can be a tool for further, more meaningful gains, the gains that fill bellies and build homes and schools, but only if we deny the reject t sort reject the sort of euqality that we are winning today.
That equality gives us a equal chance to be poor, and equal chance to be unemployed, an equal chance to drop out of school, and a more than equal chance to fight for equality someone else's freedoms thousands of miles from home.
That equality must be suppressed and replaced with an equality that provides full employment, guaranteed incomes, and makes the American nightmare the American dream.
Only when we have gotten ourselves together, only when we shall have decided who our enemies are and where the battleground ought to be, only when we know in our hearts we're right and only when we demand that our worst worse off are treated as well as white America's best off will we begin to see whether this system and this method can make a difference in our lives.
If that day does not come, then we can America will really begin to realize Langston Hughes'
22
prophecy — that dreams defferred to explode.
Watts and Newark were like firecrackers to a hydrogen bomb if the dream is defferred much longer.
For Langston Hughes wrote another poem:
Negroes
Sweet and gentle,
Soft and kind
Pity the day
They change their mind


[The following pages seem to be us-used pages from the previous speech.]

force and misery built up over 75 years.
For Reconstruction had worked, for a time for ten years, It had held out the promise that the dream could come true. To quote Bennet agains:
"" For ten years in this country, for one hundred and twenty months, men tried democracy. Black people and white people married each other in the South — and the world did not end. Little black boys and little white girls went to school together, and the Confederate dead did not rise, did not, in fact, make a sound at all, although the Klan said they were turning in their graves. All over the South, in those years, blacks and whites shared streetcars, restuarants, hotels, honors, dreams. The sun rose and set, and the Constitution of the United States had some meaning from Maine to Mississippi — for ten years.""
When those ten years ended and the black tide started North, a dream had been defferred. And the late Langston wrote that a dream defferred is like a raisin in the sun — it will fester, then explode.
As the dissilusioned Negro arrived in Detroit or Chicago or New York, he saw a certain sort of politics beckoning to him. It was a politics of machines, a politics of favors and politics that allowed black men to stop oppression but powerless to left them powerless to further the improvement of their own communities.
Despite the machinery of big city ghetto politics, a sort of politics that

political scene. Among them are the disconted dark millions who thrive in our center cities, their numbers increasing every year, their condition resisting every mild effort to encourage them to stop their restless behavior and to concentrate instead on cleaning up their family life.
We are greatfull, however, to Daniel Patrick Monyhan, the man who told us that Negro family life had deterioated, years after W. E. B. DuBois and E. Franklin Frazier told us the same thing, for the startling information that there are more of us that we ever dreamed there were. Dr. Moyhan has got the United States Census Bureau to admit it has been making a 10 per cent short count of Negroes in the United States and that we have therefore been short changed in terms of welfare funds, poverty programs based on poverty populations, and perhaps most important, political representation.
Let us look at what the future holds for Negroes now. We have become, with the resto rest of America, an urban population. In Washington, D. C., where we cannot elect a majyor or even a dogcather, we are over 65% 60% of the population.
Three o In Other Southern cities — Richmond, Nashville, New Orleans, Jacksonville and Birmingham, have Negro populations are over 40 per cent. My own city Atlanta — will have a majority Negro puopulation soon, but like those in Jacksonville and Nashville , our city fathers have found a way to dilute that black political potential through merger of city and county governments and county wide elections of mayors and other constitution officers, thus removing real power from the Negro bloc until
13
examples do spell out what a popular song has called the theory of ""different strokes for different folks.""
That is that American Negroes, despite their condition being generally the same, are different folks. We have our Republican and Democrats, our socialists communists and facists.
We have our communities which apparently have never heard the news of Lincoln's assassination, and have voted Republican since the vote was first extended, and our communities where voting still remains ""white folks business.""
But the examples of the South do have a lesson of independence and experimentation that have long dissapeared from regular politics and the two political parties , which have become in the words of a nameless adviser to Lord Bryce: ""like two bottles of the same size, the same color and the same shape with the same lableel — both of them empty.""
The future then, may hold variations on a theme sounded in 1891 by W. S. Scarborough, then a teacher at Wilberforce University:
""The troubelle is, ""he wrote, ""that the Negro is advancing too rapidly for many whiteliners, and theirre is a determination to call a halt. The Negro has been patient — yes, more than that. He has prostrated himself at the feet of the government, and has remonstrated with it to give him protection in enjoyment of his rights. The government has failed to do its duty. The end is not yet. In fact, the struggle has just begun. The blacks themselves intend to have something to say as to what shall be done with them. They intend to have a hand in the settlement of this question, and until they do, the question will never be settled. He has seen
14
He has seen so many broken pledges, violations of oaths, amd disregard for platforms and public declarations on the part of political parties, that it is found no longer advisable for the colored people to have great faith in them. This is the conclusion that many of them have come to. Recent outrages in the South and the tendency of the North to unite with Southern leaders against the blacks, prejudice and ostracism, are all having their effect and are making new creatures of the more thoughtful American Negroes. They impel the Negroes to adopt plans and measures that will in some way aid them in changing their present conditions for something more desireable. It is not a wise possibility to continue alienating the affections of the Negro, especially when there is no prospect of removing him from the country. As the whites have all to lose and the Negro but little, wisdom should dictate a concilliatory policy at least.
""The blacks themselves intend to have something to say as to what shall be done with them. They intend to have a hand in the settlement of this question, and until they do, the question will never be settled.""
That then, ought to be the future of Negro politics in America, a hand in the settlement of the question.
In the That hand has been offered over and over again over the past three and one-half centuries, and it has been turned away, slapped down, and ignored.
It may not be extended in the future, and in Scarborough's words, the question will never be settled. [And blue-ink line appears here, indicating a new paragraph break, which the editors have added.]

We must engage in a new politics.
I come here today as a new observer of the anti-war movement, and a slightly older observer and participant in the civil rights movement. As the Co-Chairmen — with California's Si Casady — of the National Conference for New Politics — I represent an organization, a movement of people from across the country who are interested in promoting and building what we call the ""New Politics.""
We define the new politics as the politics of people, the politics of those who have had no politics and no politican speaking for or to them. We think of the new politics as democratic (small ""d"") people's politics, anti-war politics, pro civil rights politics, grass roots politics.
It is Robert Scheer Drath, Black Panther, [Good lett] peace & people politics, and not Lyndon Johnson politics.
It is bringing together those people who work in the ghetto in Newark, in the suburbs and of Southside of Chicago, the Delta of Mississippi and the hills of California in a coalition community of interest.
That interest demands a decent life for all men in this country and the right to live for all men in Viet Nam.
But it believes not only in Robert Scheer or Julian Bond or whoever running for office and candidates winning or losing.
It believes in building a massive base controlled from the bottom up, a base that will one day — and one day soon — be able to pull the string that cuts off will pull the hawks back to their roosts, dump the Dixiecrats and other assorted racists, and demand and get the social and political and economic change this country needs.
But to get closer to what I think the new politics is and must do to make itself felt, I have to go back to my own experience over the past few years, and the experience of those who have spent those years trying to make the sStatute of lLiberty mean something to us.
I have to discuss certain changes that have begun to press upon the civil

rights movement, certain changes that have come from its history. And I want to try to connect those forces and changes to those people who don't live or work for civil rights in the deep South, but who live here or in New York or Chicago and who share a concern for civil rights with a concern for peace.
The civil rights movement — particularly the Southern civil rights movement — has begun to examine itself, to discuss what it has done and where it has come from and what it must and will do next.

""Black Power"", as a political technique, stems from several basic assumptions about America's ability to speedily solve her problems.
Lerone Bennett, writing in The Negro Mood, outlined three major and four minor points upon which the more militant members of the movement must agree:

that the social system, as organized, is no longer capable of solving, through normal channels, the urgent problems presented to it by history. The second is allied to the first;
that the social system, as organized, is part of the problem and cannot be appealed to or relied upon as an independent arbiter in power conflicts of which it is a part.
that white Americans, generally speaking, lack the will, courage and the intelligence to voluntarily grant Negroes their civil rights and that they must be forced to it by pressure.

In addition, the militant movement assumes:

that people do not discriminate for the fun of it, that the function of predjudice is to defend social, economic, political or psychological interests and that appeals to the fair play of predjudiced people are prayers said to the wind;
that communities will change discriminatory patterns if they are forced to do make a clear-cut choice between bias and another highly developed value — economic gain, education or civic peace.
that conflicts and struggles are necessary for social change
that the rights (and lives) of real human beings are at stake, and that these rights are neither ballotable or bnegotiable.

Coupled with these are certain political assumptions, spelled out by Atlanta University's Dr. Samuel DuBois Cook:

since Negroes are in a minority in most parts of the United States, we must make alliances based on their ability to promote racial goals. In
[list interrupted by the following handwritten notes on the verso.]
middle class whites share the sentiments, but not the condition; lower class white share the condition, but not the sentiment.
The movement discovered when the vote was won that a ransom had been paid and the hostage was dead. The hostage was the promise that the right to votes equals freedom; the ransom was that the years and lives that believed that endured because they thought the hostage's life was worth saving.

	general the so-called alliances between Negroes and elements of the white community do not serve the interests of Negroes; indeed, they are not genuine alliances. They are ad hoc arrangements to use the Negro vote to elect certain white politicans.
Negroes must avoid marriage to any political party.
Negroes must initiate and support massive programs of political and civic education — teaching the masses not only the mechanics of voting but the benefits of the political process as well.
Negroes must initiate issues as well as react to them.
Negroes must not forget race consciousness as long as they are the victims of racism. If in fact the issue is forgotten by Negroes, the social order will continue to sanctify the established system that excludes Negroes from free and equal participation and consideration.

We have been told over the past several years at meetings like this one by speakers like myself that the liberal and radical communities of America are on the verge of a serious revolution.
Usually those of us who says those sorts of things and those of us who make listen to those sorts of statements really mean that if only we can get together, things will have to get better; they can't get any worse.
We make these statements, and applaud them when we hear them, because we hope things will get better. We hope that war will end, that racism will dissapear, that poverty will vanish.
Unfortunately, hoping doesn't make it so. Wishing doesn't make it so. Only action and pressure and force make things give in.
We all here tonight I believe know exactly what our difficulties are. We know that the war in Vietnam gets wider and wider. We know that the governments in Siagon, in Seoul, in Nationalist China want it even wider, and want to lead this country on an a spree in the name of anti-communism like a drunken sailor being lead through a brothel by three oriental prostitutes.
We know that domestically, conditions for black people are worse, if anything, than they were some years ago.
We know that teen-age unemployment among Negroes is greater now in relation to the same figures for white teenagers than it ever has been.
Infant mortality for blacks was 70% higher than for whites some years ago; today it is 90% higher.
We know that average annual income for Negroes is less today in proportion to what the average white wage-earner makes than it ever has been.
We know these sorts of things. We know them, but we generally tend not to do anything about them.
Some of us picket and pass out leaflets, and march, again and again and [page break] again, to Washington to petition our government.
Some few of us still write letters to our congressmen or to our papers. And some of us thrown stones and bricks and bombs at the symbols of the oppression that stifles our lives and sets our future before we are given any indication that we are bound to fail.
[Penciled line appears in the left margin along the next two paragraphs.]
But most of us, nearly all of us, have decided that nothing will do, and therefore we do nothing.
There's good reason for that feeling. We used to, many, many years ago, place our hopes in the Democratic party. We used to believe that the infusion of radicals and liberals into that party would turn it around, would make it the people's party, the party we all wanted to belong to and believe in.
But what has happened to our hopes?
We see the nation's vice president, elected by that party, walking hand in hand with my governor, a man elected because of his ability to shake an axe handle at Negro divinity school student.
We see that party in convention, four years ago, refusing the greatest political gift ever offered — the gift of allegiance from the newly franchised black voters of Mississippi.
We see that party preparing for its convention this year, four years later, still unprepared to accept that gift, and beginning today to remind us that even if President Johnson has to be nominated elected behind barbed wire and barricades, he will be nominated. But after all, his proteges in Vietnam were elected in that fashion, and what is good enough for them ought to be good enough for him.
We see that party preparing now to find a way to say ""nigger"" without saying nigger. It is crime in the streets, police protection, safety for our children, and private property rights.
And we look at the party of opposition, and what do we see? We see tricky dicky the man you wouldn't buy a used car from, and the man who made sure that no Negro would ever buy his house.
[page break] We see good George Rommney, the man who from whom I made the mistake of buying a new car once.
We see Nelson Rockefeller, the man who won't say how he feels about the war but who really feels that Lyndon Johnson is handling it just fine.
We have Bobby Kennedy, who says he will support Eugene McCarthy or Lyndon Johnson, whichever wins the Democratic primaries, as if he had no responsibility to aid McCarthy in his solitary challenge. Robert Kennedy talks of morality in politics, but is unwilling to take a moral position in favor of McCarthy's challenge and unwilling to place himself in the moral position of active opposition to Lyndon B. Johnson.
[Penciled line appears in the left margin along the next five paragraphs.]
And we have George C. Wallace, half of Alabama's white-face version of Beulah and Tom, the original bedfellow making strange politics. Wallace speaks for more white Americans than we here tonight dare to imagine; he says openly the sorts of things that white workers and bankers in Alabama and Pennsylvania want to hear.
Where does that leave us? Where can we turn? Senator McCarthy has offered us one avenue, but it is an avenue that seems doomed to end with the Democratic primaries this spring.
I think, however, that all of us know that the war will not be over by spring. We all know that poverty will not end by spring. And we all know that racism in America will not end by spring.
An effective protest, the building of an effective movement to make America become the America we want, must not stop nextspring or next summer or on election day in November.
That protest can begin here tonight, if enough of us are willing to spend enough time to work and knock on doors and pound enough pavements to put before the people the sorts of programs and platforms that will mean a better life for all of us.
[page break] The peace civil rights movement and the anti-war movements can learn from each other. The civil rights movement has discovered, after eight years of sit-ins and march-ins and lie-ins that lunch counter integration is meaningless to people without jobs; thatbus-station integration is meaningless to people without enough money to buy a bus ticket; and that integration will continue to be meaningless as long as its lets us in for the sort of equality we are now beginning to reach.
That equality gives us an equal chance to be poor; it gives us an equal chance to live in a slum; it gives us an equal chance to be on welfare; it gives us an equal chance to at a bad education, a dead-end job, and an more than equal chance to travel thousands of miles from home to fight for freedoms we haven't yet begun to enjoy here.
We reject that kind of equality. We reject the old politics of favors and deals and obligations. We have to begin to insist on a politics of freedom and peace, a politics that gives power to the powerless, a politics that says the issue os not crime in the streets but crime in Vietnam, a politics that places domestic reform of over foreign counter-revolution.
Now none of us ought ever to believe that politics solves all problems. It obviously will not.
And we ought not ever believe that politics is going to be the only way that problems can be solved. It is not.
[Penciled line appears in the left margin along the next paragraph.]
And we ought not believe that any single candidate elected in 1968 is going to mean heaven on earth for any of us. Those who follow the Senator from Massachusetts and New York and Washington and Virginia ought to know now that a long-haired knight on a white horse isn't going to ride in and save us. But we can make a beginning. If you believe that history teaches you that revolution will change this country, than practice what you preach. If you believe, however, that only organized, consistent, militant pressure will ever [page break] begin to make a difference, then your responsibility ist is to begin that pressure now."

Over the years between 1960 and 1965, the black college student was the decisive factor in social change for those black people less fortunate than the students themselves.
With the beginnings of the student sit-in movement in February, 1960, the black college student became the primary movers and doers on the racial scene. For nearly five years, black college students lead and directed and helped to man to barricades of a movement, begun on black college campuses, that eventually began to touch the lives of rural black people throughout the states of the old confederacy.
The movement these young people made moved from the Southern black college campus to the Southern fields where academic degrees were useless. The movement against segregated lunch counters moved against segregated voting booths in parts of the South where a college education meant next to nothing.
Now in 19678, the participation of those same young people is limited. [A handwritten dash appears under the date in the previous sentence, likely pointing out the revision to the year.] Some have withdrawn because things have gotten better, they say. Others never joined, believing it better to somehow prepare themselves for some new tomorrow where racial distinctions would have dissapeared and men would considered one another on merit.
That both of these assumptions is false can be quickly shown.

What is needed by from the talented elite of Negro America is the thinking and plotting and planning and training to lead the rest of us into a new and better life.
We need to examine all plans and programs offered by all our leaders and see where each will lead.
Is political participation, the avenue of other immigrant and ethnic groups, to be our way of moving up the ladder?
Or ought we not realize the Watts, Detroit and Newark showed that American Negroes are voting more and enjoying it less. In fact, the events of this past summer ought to show us that the old style of politics, the politics that has made this country what it is today, is incapable of answering the needs of Negro people across the country.
The black college student is indeed a member of an elite. There are only 200,000 of us in college at all, and of that number, 90% attend all-Negro schools. And over the past summer, we have seem those schools subjected to vicious and nearly racists attacks by college professors who ought to know better, including one who teaches at Harvard, a school that featured its own cross burings a few years ago.
The black millions outside that lucky 200,000 thousand live in the same conditions today they lived in 5 and 10 years ago.
As Kenneth Clark wrote in his Dark Ghetto: ""The dark ghettos are social, political, educational and — above all — economic colonies. Their inhabitants are subject people, victims of the greed, cruelty, insensitivity, guilt and fear of their masters.""
Just as the events of the past seven years have caused members of the elite represented by the black college student to escape from the ghetto Clark described, the rest of us, most of us, all of the Negroes who are not fortunate enough to become members of of the Great Society, lost ground relative to white people. To quote our President, Lyndon Baines Johnson:
7
President Johnson
In 1930, the rate of unemployment for Negroes and whites was about the same. 35 years later, the Negro rate is twice as high. In 1948, the 8 per cent unemployment rate for Negro teen-age boys was less than that for whites. By 1964, the rate had grown to 23 per cent, twice that for white teen agers. Between 1949 and 1959, the income of Negro men relative to white men declined in every section of the country. From 1952 to 1963, the median income of Negro families compared to white actually dropped 4%.
Since 1947, the numver of white families living in poverty has decreased 27% while the number of poor non-white families has decreased inly 3%. In infant mortality of nonwhites in 1940 was 70% greater than whites. 22 years later it was 90 per cent greater. (And I might add it is greater today in central Harlem than it is in Saigon, a figure which may give some indication of where our national values are placed.)
[A handwritten line in blue ink appears here, separating these two paragraphs.]
Those are the problems that the black college student must address himself to. And he ought to seek aid and assistance from his white colleagues, but it must be just that, aid and assistance, and not direction. The blacl student must rid himself of the notion that his degree from the [illegible] [sity] of Sin Morehouse or from Harlem Harvard will solve his problems or the problems of his race, for not even Ralph Bunche' degrees and status could get his little black son into the Forrest Hills Tennis Club.
The dliimena for the black student is exactly that — to play Ralph Bunche or to play Frederick Douglas, to play Booker T. Washington, or to play W. E. B. DuBois, to play Edward Brooke, or to play Henry McNeal Turner, the Negro who preceded me into the Geprgia House of Representatives, and who left that body 99 years ago with these words:
[Two handwritten marks appear just before the following quote, possibly large open quote marks.]
""We are told that if black men want to speak, they must speak through white trumpets; if black men want their sentiments expressed, they must be adulterated and sent through white messengers, who will quibble, and equivocate and evade as rapidly as the pendulum of a clock. Well let me say this to the colored
8
men of Georgia (and let me say it to the colored men of Cincinnati) The Black man cannot protect a country if the country doesn't protect him; and if tomorrow a war should arise, I would not raise a finger t musket to defend a country where my manhood is denied. I will say this much to the colored men of Georgia. Never lift a finger or raise a hand in defense of Georgia, unless Georgia acknowledges that you are men and invests you with the right pertaining to manhood.""
[Two handwritten marks appear just after the previous quote, possibly large close quote marks.]
And the responsibility of the black college students today is to reject the Lyndon Johnson notion of America and adopt, instead, the Frederick Douglass vision. Douglass was asked over 100 years ago what American holidays meant to American Negroes and he answered:
What to the American slave is your fourth of July. I answer, a day that reveals to him more than all the other days of the year the grand gross injustice and cruelty to which he is constant victim. To him, your celebration is a sham; your boasted liberty, and unholy liscence, your national greatness, swelling vanity, your sounds of rejoicing are empty and heartless, your denunciation of tyrants, brass fronted impudence, your prayers and hymns sermons and thanksgivings with all your religious parade and solemnity, are to him mere bombast, fraud, deception impiety and hypocrisy — a thin velie to cover up crimes that would disgrace a nation of savages. There is anot a nation of earth guilty of practices more shocking and bloody than aret are the people of the United States at this very hour."""

It is a pleasure to speak before a group of people who are about to take giant steps into the world of journalism, to begin being a part of the process that makes us — so we are told — the best informed nation in history.
All of you will go forth and undoubtedly follow in the path set for you by the various standards set above the mastheads of most newspapers — seeking out ""All the New That's Fit To Print"" or as my old newspaper used to put it, ""Reporting the Truth Without Fear or Favor""
You will be — or already have been — in discussions about objectivity, or the reporter as obverser-participant. Those whom you profess to want to aid through your reportage will accuse you of being establishment dupes. Your government may seize your notebooks and may threaten you. Some of your constituency will ask you why you only seem to seek out ""bad"" news; others will ask why you never print anything true!
But in addition to all of this, there exist the hope that because you are who you are — members of the groups of must studied and examined and reported but least understood and heard Americans — that you bring something special to your chosen profession.
One interesting fact — none of you come from — or will be going to — any of the 150 plus newspapers or other news journals owned by black people. None of you come from — or are going to — any of the handful of radio stations owned by black people, or the many more white owned radio stations that aim at black markets.
Instead, you will find yourselves working for big city dailies and fairly big city TV stations.
And although black people will certainly see you and read your stories, your audience will be predominately white.
That's as it should be, you may believe. After all, you may say, it is white people who run the country, who make up the majority population, who make the decisions about our lives, who
2
are in the position to improve our condition, and who own the newspapers and TV stations that will pay us salaries that will enable us to live and feed our families.
So then what can someone say to you as a graduation speech that willdo what these speeches are susposed to do — charge you up, fillyou with fervor, send you out into the world to slay the dragon.
That is such an enormous job that no one with pen in hand or camera over shoulder ought to be expected to accomplish it alone. Your job then is to buind the army through your reportage that will slay the dragon for the rest of us.
Because your profession calls for many facts, tempered by some opinion, you must be ready with fact.
The facts for us are constantly shifting and turning, and you must be prepared to sift them. The opinions on us, for us and about us constantly shift and turn too, and you must keep a steady hand on your own opinions.
If the facts show that American black people are proportionately worse off now than ever ever during the past twenty years, then that fact must be revealed and explained.
If the facts show government repression creeping slowly over us all, then that fact must be revealed and explained.
If the facts show a progression in the history of the relations between the lighter and darker faces of man, then that fact must be releaved and explained.
The disgraceful condition of the non-white people of this country will may be a continuing fact during your careers; the conti increasing agression of your country's military forces in Southeast Asia seems likely to be a continuing fact as well.
These two facts are connected to each other, although each might cont survive alone. Together, they contribute to everything else that may be of priority to you in your work — the sorry condition of our cities; the dependence of one tenth of our labor force ofn war spending; the reactionary stance of the United States Congress; the incredible hunger and malnutrition oin the richest country in
3
the world.
There is no escaping the connectedness of these facts in a country where more money is spent of pet food than food stamps; where private citizens spend more money on tabacco than all government does on education; where wealthy farmers receive welfare handouts but supplements for the poor are laughed out of congress; where five per cent of the people have twenty per cent of the wealth and twenty per cent of the people have five percent of the wealth, you may be the generation who writes the obituaries for us all.
It cannot be a mistake that the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and certain American capitalists make the same analysis of the United States; that ana;ysis suggests that this country has to maintain its grip
[The page content ends here. A new, unnumbered page begins.]
It might be done by having you take as your standard a bit from the editorial of the first black newspaper ever published in the United States, Freedom's Journal, which stated:
In a spirit of candor and humility we intend, by a simple representation of facts, to lay our case before the public with a view to arrest the progress of predjudice, and to sheild ourselves against the consequent evils. We hope to conciliate all, and to irritate none, yet we must be firm and unwavering in our principles and persevering in our efforts.""

The crisis which faces Black schools is simply another visable manifestation of the crisis which has historically faced Black people in this country. Can one really One ought not expect a nation which disrespects the lives and liberties of Black people to give an inkling of respect to the minds of young black students? Can One ought not realistically expect a nation which is never through with killing to take the time or the resources to build viable Black centers for learning? Can we expect a nation which allows the invasion of Guinea to really lift a finger to halt the invasion of Jackson State, or to punish the murderers of Black students at Orangeburg? Can we really expect these things or must we as a colonized people prepare ourselves for more midnight murders and day - light assults?
I used the term colonized people because I feel that the confusion surrounding Black people, and our traditional difficulties with the so-called American way of life stems from our status in this country as a colonial people, and from the fact that we are increasingly being forced to employ the traditional methods and techniques of the colonial subject to escape from the oppression of the colonial
2
power. And These methods and techniques of colonial subjects have historically included the politics of violence.
We have already seen ample evidence of what sort of violence has been visited on the oppressed people of the world for centuries. We are likely to see increasing answers in violence from those who have been on the receiving line all too often.
We need to discover what is and what isn't violent in America.
Violence is Black children going to school for twelve years and receiving five years of education.
Violence is sending your child to college as a maturing Black man or woman and having them him returned to you a full grown Greek.
Violence is having our children educationed or miseducated away from themselves, away from their music, their dance, their religion, their people and often their very souls.
It is violent to tell a man to pull himself up by his bootstraps, especially if you have stolen his boots, boot laces, bootstraps and socks. 
3
Violence is foolish patriotism.
Violence is 30 million hungry stomachs in the most affluent nation on earth.
Violence is a country where property counts more than people.
Violence is an economy that believes in socialism for the rich and capitalism for the poor.
Violence is spending $78 billion to kill and only $12 billion to make whole.
Violence is J. Edgar Hoover listening to your telephone conversations; violence is an Assistant Attorney General proposing concentration camps for white and Black militants; Violence is blowing up two Black men and saying they did it themselves.
Violence is Richard Nixon and Spiro Agnew ignoring the expression of peace of millions of Americans.
We must begin to understand what violence is and we must identify the truely violent members of the American society. This knowledge, this analytical ability, this course in self-
4
preservation has been historically ought to be taught in Black schools. Manifestly with all that can be said, pro and con, and in extinuation, and by way of excuse and hope, Education for Black students in a situation of oppression must be an education for liberation. There is no human way by which this fact can be ignored. We cannot do our daily work, sing a song or write a book or carry on in a university and act as though liberation was not the order of the day.
If this is true then no matter how much we may dislike the statement , the problems of African people must be the center of the Black school. It has got to be. Black educators must teach Black students. There is no use pretending OR wishing that they should teach Chinese, or they should teach white Americans or that they should teach citizens otfehe the world. You should be teaching Black students in 1970 because they are subjects of a violent system in
5
the republic of the United States of American and their problem is primarily the problem of racism.
Black education in this country must begin with Black people. It must muse that variety of the English idiom which we understand; and above all, it is founded or it should be founded on a knowledge of the history of Black people in Africa and in the United States, and their our present condition. Without whitewashing or translating wish into fact, it begins with us; and it asks how can these young gifted and Black men and women best struggle for the liberation of oppressed people.
Black students in 1970 are very similar to Black students of 1960. In a letter to a friend, One Black student described his generation this way, as he wrote to a college friend:
"". . . we are both young, and compared to our elders we are ignorant of many lessons of life. But our
6
youth contains a moral maturity which our elders too often overlook or simply dismiss. Our youthful sensaitive minds invision a world in which injustice, war, exploitation, racism, poverty and disease will become anachronisms. Our generation is a feeling generaltion, not just sensuous, but primarily alturistic altruistic. I constantly awaken in the early hours of the morning hearing the wails of millions. My heart hears the cries of the suppressed in Viet Nam and South Africa, in Harlem and Detroit, in Mississippi and Alabama, and in every country, state, city, village, hamlet or house where injustice rules supreme.""
It is not easy to be ""young, gifted and Black"" in these times and in this country. To exist in such mental chaos is uncomfortable . It seems to be a type of schizophrenia in which one can imagine

by day a glorious world striving for perfection and dream that very night of a thousand tearful mothers holding lifeless infants in their own napoalm scorched arms. When ever we are tormented by this dream.. this nightmare, then we should be strengthened by the knowledge that we belong to a glorious people whom Dr. DuBois described as, ""...that Black host to whom discouragement is yet an unwritten word.""
To be young , gifted , and Black then means indeed that ""ours is the quest that's just begun."" Our quest is to make real the Creators plan which is, as Pharoah Saunders said, ""peace and happiness for every man."" How do we reach our goals? What methods must we employ? Individual entrepreneurship has created a class of Black millionaires in publishing, insurance and the cosmetic hair straightening fields, but has done little for the economic uplift of most Black people.
Pressure group politics has won many needed reforms for our race,
8
but these reforms are proving nearly impossible to make secure in colonial society.
The traditional coalitions of Black people, labor, and the more enlightened church leadership have failed in bringing about the beloved society that was dreamed of in the early 60's. The American labor movement hasd begun to show its true colors as Black people began demanding not only labor connected goals like minimum wages, but entry into the craft unions which have always been lily white. The churches have all too often played a gadfly role: Black people today, the war in Vietnam tomorrow, abortion reform the next.
The hoped-for coalition with white college students has failed to materialize, as far too many of this group have shown more interest in boutique radicalism mustsic , drugs , radical groups that began black but have moved from the grey to the gay the romantic rhetoric of revolution and the enobling sacrifice of self-enforced poverty than in the very real
9
problems of existence that afflict most Black people in this country.
So we are left to an ever spiraling scale of politics , and then protest , and then revolt, with the probable result that increasing repression will follow.
Here is a description of the process:
""The people with the fewest illusions about the welfare state are the poor who are served by it. When they protest, usually in the name of American ideals, an interesting reaction follows. Some among the majority react sympathetically, though not always with real understanding of the causes. But a sufficient number of opposing interests are aroused to prevent any drastic change, and often even moderate changes are blocked. The poor, who in most cases begin by politely petitioning their governors, soon take more drastic steps, thinking they can perhaps awaken the conscience of the majority or
10
at least of higher authorities. They do awaken the conscience of some people, and to some extent they force elites to concede token changes. But at the same time, a 'counterrevolution' is triggered against the potential of revolution which has been seen in the mounting protest. The system becomes deadlocked. No more than token reforms, crumbs, result of the protestors. The scale of their protest increases as they realize that appeals to conscience are inadequate. They look for methods of transcending the pressure politics that have not worked. They begin civil disobedience and disruption. The immediate reaction of the power structure is to maintain order. The police are brought into the conflict. Considerations of social, political or economic solutions to be the conflict are gradually replaced by the emphasis on law and order. Violent repression becomes routine.""*
It becomes clear from that analysis that the only escape from this trap is revolution, either violent on the part of both sides of the
11
question, or a revolution in thinking, psychology and political position on at least one side.
It is that second revolution that is bursting upon us today. It springs, first of all, from the Black community. It is a revolution in thinking about ourselves which Black schools have fostered, a revolution turning upside down the perverse analysis that made us -- the victims -- describe ourselves as the causes of our own wretched condition.
It is found most concretely in the growing desire among Black people to reject the kind of tribalization of class and geography that has divided us for so long, and to bring us together as as a colonialized ideological nation within this nation.
It is found in the rejection by Black people of white standards of beauty and qualification and education that have plagued us for so long.
12
But that kind of cultural + psychological revolution will not do the job alone. We may -- as we are slowly about to do -- engage in a relativly nonviolent political revolution take over the major cities of this country and hold them as Black enclaves against increasing repression, charging admission fees to suburban whites who must come to the city for jobs and income, and who must depend on the city as a source of police protection and utility service.
But some we would like to depnd on white majority America as a source of simple decency of treatment, a hope that many would call extremely naive. Some We would like, for example, to be treated as well as American farmers are. First they were given free lands. Then they were given low interest loans to enable them to buy farm machinery. Then the Department of Agriculture sent their farm agents to show them how to use their machines and to rotate their crops. Now we pay them not to do anything, a form of millionaire welfarism that is scorned by poor Black people.
13
Suppose, for example, that an ADC mother was paid not to produce at the same rate that the gentleman farmer Senator James O. Eastland is. That would mean that welfare mothers in Detroit or Chicago or Watts could collect as much as $125,000 each a year for not having babies.
But the revolution demands that we be allowed not more than, but access simply the same as to the same ladders used by other groups. Why, we ask, must patronage be abolished as a political reward when Blacks take over the cities after political favoritism has done so much of for Italians and Irishmen? Why must good government advocatessuggest metropolitanism as a the only panacea to urban ills at a time when we Blacks are about to take over some cities? Why must some women -- most of them white -- and some homosexuals -- most of them white -- and some other groups ,all of them incorrect -- insist that our liberation is dependent upon theirs?
14
The answer must be that no one -- unless it is the American Indian -- has priority over the justifiable demands of Black people. And that only Black people can set the pace, techniques and methods used by Black people in our struggle.
Foremost among these but not exclusively must be political action, but not the old style of machine politics of the unequal Black -- labor -- liberal coalition that we have entered into like a willing bridgegroom so many times in the past, only to emerge ravished and our innocence gone.
Our politics must be an aggressive , independent , politics, free from any alliances of party or partisanship that has made us slaves first to the part of Lincoln (which is not the party of Nixon) and now to the party of Roosevelt (which is also the party of Richard Daily,) We must begin to seize land and power where we are, in the cities and the black belt counties of the old Confederacy. As whites flee these
15
areas for the comfort and security of the suburbs, they create a political vacuum that we must fill.
But the cities are crumbling beneath us, and the presence of a Black mayor alone will not insure that these decaying compounds will be liveable again.
The Black inhabitants of rural America have a better chance at achieving a decent life, for the cost of living is lower there and the people know better how to live, but even these victors will discover that political gains can be destroyed by an economy that still remains in the hands of the European mentality of the plantation bosses. So, as we get our politics together, we must try to get our economics together as well. This means that while we reject the obviously absurd Nixonian notion of Black capitalism, we must not hesitate to accept any communalistic economic advantage that might accrue accure to our group as a whole.
16
This means striving for economic plans as different as the designs plotted by kthe Honorable Elijah Muhammad in the South to the neighborhood cooperatives springing up in ghettoes across the country, to the transfer of mom-and-pop stores from white hands to Black ones; as well as any other plan or scheme that will put money into the pockets of Black people.
It means that we cannot afford the luxury available to so many dilettantes who seek to define for us what is right and what is wrong -- indeed, even what is Black and what is white, in our struggle. At a time when our community seems about to draw together an alliance of cultural nationalists and political activits, of poverty workers and poverty livers, of foot washing Baptists and the Nation of Islam, we cannot afford a pot smoking Woodstock in a nation that still tolerates a death stenched Watts; we cannot demand liberation for special groups
17
until the whole group goes free.
That suggests that the fragile, sometime security of the college campus is not the proper place from which to engage in remote antiseptic criticism of people who seldom see a book from year to year; that the presence of ROTC on the campus is not nearly as earthshaking an issue as the presence of rats in the ghetto; that debates about the relative revisionism of the late Ho Chi Minh had best be neglected until we have started our own revolution here.
Finally, we must prepare for a time of trouble ,and repression if the provisions of the criminally insance Washington, D.C. Crime Act are any indication, or the unwillingness of the House Internal Security Committee to help abolish the concentration camp features of the McCarran Act are a signal for the future, then we had better beware and prepare for hard times and many deaths ahead.
[The ""concentration camp features"" in the previous paragraph are likely referring to the 1950 McCarran Internal Security Act's Emergency Detention Act, Title II; the Emergency Detention Act was repealed in September 1971, after this speech was written.]
Through these hard times, we might prepare ourselves with the
18
words of Frantz Fannon, who wrote how the race problem might be solved. He said then:
""Come now comrades, it would be well to decide at once to change our ways. We must shake off the heavy darkness in which we were plunged and leave it behind. The new day which is already at hand must find us firm, prudent and resolute. We must leave our dreams and abandon our old beliefs and friendships of the time before life began. Let us waste no time in sterile litanies and nauseating mimicry. Leave this Europe where they are never done talking of man, yet murder men everywhere they find them, at the corner of every one of their streets and almost every corner of the globe. For centuries they have stifled almost the whole of humanity in the name of so-called spiritual
19
existence. Look at them today swaying between atomic and spiritual disintegration. Let us decide not to imitate Europe.
Let us combine our muscles and our brains in a new direction. Let us try to create the whole man whom Europe has been incapable of bringing to triumphant birth. Two centuries ago a former European colony decided to catch up with Europe. It succeeded so well that the United States of America became a monster in which the tainsts taints, the sickness, and the inhumanity of Europe have grown to appaling dimensions. It is a question of the third world starting a new history of man. If we wish to live up to our people's expectations we must seek the response somewhere other than Europe.
...We must work out new concepts and try to set afloat a new man.""

20
This is the challenge of Black education in the seventies. And we must not be ashamed of that Black challenge. For as a friend of mine and a native of Greensboro once wrote:
""...Can I help but to shout with joy our beautiful Blackness and the challenge that it offers?
Go tell the groping grass
Frost bitten and pale,
Not to quicken when raised
By the warm summer rains.
But tell me not to whisper or hide my Blackness.
Go tell the proud roosters,
That perch on the trees,
Not to sing loud their praises
To sunshine at dawn.

21
But tell me not to whisper or hide by Blackness. To my generation I promise and to the word world I proclaim:
This beautiful Blackness of mine, I'm gonna let it shine. Let it shine, let it shine, all the time.

I am more than honored to receive this award, and want to express my thanks to all responsible for it. I want to promise you that I intend to live my life as if I actually deserve it.
I believe it represents a common acknowledgement that denial of rights to anyone is wrong, and that struggles for rights are indivisible.
I feel tonight a little like the great abolitionist Frederick Douglass must have felt in April, 1888. Douglass, by then an old man, was addressing a women's convention in Seneca Falls, New York. They praised him for his devotion to the cause of women's suffrage. Forty years earlier, at the world's first Women's Rights Convention, when Susan B. Anthony made a motion that American women had the right to vote, it was Douglass who seconded the motion.
In 1888, Douglass reflected back on that moment and told his audience,
When I ran away from slavery, it was for myself; when I advocated emancipation, it was for my people; but when I stood up for the rights of women, self was out of the question, and I found a little nobility in the act.

You have all made me feel noble tonight.
I am proud to represent an organization that has fought for justice for all for nearly 100 years, and while we've won many victories, we know — you know — there are other battles yet to be waged and won.
At the NAACP, we were proud to have opposed the federal marriage amendment and its wrong-headed versions in several states. President Bush backed amendments banning same-sex marriage, calling marriage ""the most fundamental institution of civilization.""
Isn't that precisely why one should support, not oppose, gay marriage?
The NAACP recently passed a resolution to strengthen families, including yours. We promised to ""pursue all legal and constitutional means to support non-discriminatory policies and practices against persons based on race, gender, sexual orientation, nationality or cultural background.""
We know there was a time, not so long ago, when black people in this country couldn't marry the person of their choice either. The California Supreme Court was the first, in 1948, to strike down laws prohibiting interracial marriage.
Now the California legislature has become the first to legalize gay marriage.
2
As California goes, so goes the nation. It's just a matter of time.
Almost twenty years after California legalized interracial marriage, the United States Supreme Court heard the aptly named case Loving v. Virginia.
A married couple — Richard Loving, a white man, and Mildred Jeter, a black woman — won a ruling from the court that Virginia's miscegenation laws were unconstitutional. That case enabled me to get married in Virginia. That case recognized marriage as one of the inviolable personal rights pursuant to happiness.
That's why when I am asked, ""Are Gay Rights Civil Rights?"" my answer is always, ""Of course they are.""
""Civil rights"" are positive legal prerogatives — the right to equal treatment before the law. These are rights shared by all — there is no one in the United States who does not — or should not — share in these rights.
Gay and lesbian rights are not ""special rights"" in any way. It isn't ""special "" to be free from discrimination — it is an ordinary, universal entitlement of citizenship. The right not to be discriminated against is a common-place claim we all expect to enjoy under our laws and our founding document, the Constitution. That many had to struggle to gain these rights makes them precious — it does not make them special, and it does not reserve them only for me or restrict them from others.
When others gain these rights, my rights are not reduced in any way. The fight for ""civil rights"" is a win/win game; the more civil rights won by others, the stronger the army defending my rights becomes. My rights are not diluted when my neighbor enjoys protection from the law — he or she becomes my ally in defending the rights we all share.
For some, comparisons between the African-American civil rights movement and the movement for gay and lesbian rights seem to diminish the long black historical struggle with all its suffering, sacrifices and endless toil. However, people of color ought to be flattered that our movement has provided so much inspiration for others, that it has been so widely imitated, and that our tactics, methods, heroines and heroes, even our songs, have been appropriated by or served as models for others.
No parallel between the movements for rights is exact. African-Americans are the only Americans who were enslaved for more than two centuries, and people of color carry the badge of who we are on our faces. But we are far from the only people suffering discrimination — sadly, so do many others. They deserve the law's protections and civil rights, too.
Sexual disposition parallels race — I was born black and had no choice. I couldn't change and wouldn't change if I could. Like race, our sexuality isn't a preference — it is immutable, unchangeable, and the Constitution protects us all against prejudices and discrimination based on immutable differences.
3
Those whose bigotry is Bible-based selectively ignore Biblical injunctions in Exodus to execute people who work on the Sabbath and in Leviticus to crack down on those who get haircuts or who wear clothes with more than one kind of thread.
Recently, they've even ignored the sanctity of marriage — just ask Michael Schiavo.
Many gays and lesbians worked side by side with me in the '60s civil rights movement. Am I to now tell them ""thanks"" for risking life and limb helping me win my rights — but they are excluded because of a condition of their birth? That they cannot share now in the victories they helped to win? That having accepted and embraced them as partners in a common struggle, I can now turn my back on them and deny them the rights they helped me win, that I enjoy because of them?
Not a chance.
In 1965, those of us who worked in civil rights movement were buoyed by a radio address given by Lyndon Johnson.
His words speak to us today. He said then:
It is difficult to fight for freedom. But I also know how difficult it can be to bend long years of habit and custom to grant it. There is no room for injustice anywhere in the American mansion. But there is always room for understanding those who see the old ways crumbling. And to them today I say simply this: It must come. It is right that it should come. And when it has, you will find the burden has been lifted from your shoulders too. It is not just a question of guilt, although there is that. It is that men cannot live with a lie and not be stained by it.

One lesson of the civil rights movement of yesterday — and the on-going civil rights movement of today — is that sometimes the simplest of ordinary acts — taking a seat on a bus or a lunch counter, registering to vote, applying for a marriage license — can have extraordinary ramifications. It can change our world, change the way we act and think.
Thank you again for this honor.
The old ways are crumbling.
It must come.
Let us leave here determined to fight on until it does.

A short time ago, I received a letter from my high school counselor of many years ago. He had come across a report he had written about my school performance, which in his words. ""recorded very average academic achievement.""
But, his report continued, ""If this young man ever finds something to get excited about and to devote himself to, he will go far and accomplish a great deal!""
I consider this award to be the vindication of my high school counselor's long-ago hopes for me — I found something — and I thank you a great deal for this honor.
The NAACP, whose board I chair, was one of the founders of the Leadership Conference on Civil Rights. We are proud of that role, and proud to be a part of the large and diverse coalition of concerned who represent justice in the nation's capital and across the land.
I am thankful to the Leadership Conference for this great honor, and the NAACP is grateful that you stood with us when the IRS attacked.
It is particularly gratifying that this award is named for Hubert Humphrey. I have an affection for Minnesotans — I am married to one. In fact, we are going there in the morning — and I will whisper a salute to Vice-President Humphrey on his home ground.
I first ""got excited"" about doing civil rights work in the 1960s as part of the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee (SNCC). In our work, we were not acting alone — nor were we the first to act. Our partners and our predecessors were Southerners, mostly black and some white. They included sharecroppers, working class women and men, and a few professionals. They were not the famous; they were the faceless. They
2
were not the noted; they were the nameless.
In our actions, we stood on the shoulders of generations who had struggled anonymously for decades, seeking freedom's elusive prize.
President Jimmy Carter said: ""If you wanted to scare white people in Southwest Georgia, Martin Luther King and the Southern Christian Leadership Conference wouldn't do it. You only had to say one word — SNCC!""
President John F. Kennedy had gone him one better. He said that compared to others, SNCC workers were ""real sons of bitches.""
We are now in another period of our history when it is sometimes necessary to be ""real sons of bitches."" Necessary to proceed with passion! Necessary not to go along but to be strong!
Whenever religion trumps science; when theocracy threatens democracy; when ethics rules are re-written to protect the guilty; when judicial independence is threatened; when civil rights protections are under attack; when plutocracy rules and wealth reigns; when Darwin's theory is ignored and Darwinian economics adopted; when patriotism becomes mindless conformity and the refuge of the scoundrel; when the tax-man tries to gag the government's critics and silence those who dare challenge it; when one group of self-styled religionists believes it can excommunicate others; when doctors purport to diagnose by videotape; then we need, without delay, to continue to speak truth to power with the collective strength of all of us here tonight and all those at the grassroots whom we represent.
That brings to mind the words of another Minnesotan, the late Paul Wellstone, who speaks to us still. He said:
""I do not believe that the future will belong to those who are content with the present . ... The future will belong to those who have passion, and to those grass-roots heroes who are willing to make the personal commitment to make our country better.""

He was right. The future belongs to us!

Thank you all.

We are meeting on Presidents' Weekend, so I want to say a few words about Presidents — one to whom we bid farewell and another who has never said ""hello.""
Most of you know that CEO Kweisi Mfume left the NAACP in December, 2004. We salute him for all that he did to bring us to the position of prominence that we enjoy today.
While the search for a new CEO continues, the NAACP is in the excellent day-to-day hands of our General Counsel, Dennis Hayes. Mr. Hayes has done a marvelous job of keep us on track, and he deserves our applause and gratitude for taking on this extra burden.
Unfortunately, as one President left, another stayed.
The November election served as a reminder of the extent to which the body politic feeds off race.
It was Lyndon Johnson, not Karl Rove, who predicted the outcome of last fall's election. When he signed the Civil Rights Act of 1964, Johnson told his young aide Bill Moyers,
""I think we delivered the South to the Republican Party for your lifetime and mine.""i

2
That year, despite his national landslide, Johnson lost five Southern states, including four that the Democrats had not lost in 84 years. Now the Republicanization of the former slave states is complete. In 2004 George W. Bush won the South by five million votes, meaning that he lost the rest of the country by a million-and-a-half votes.
Five Senate seats in the old Confederacy went from Democratic to Republican, increasing the GOP's total to 18 of the region's 22 seats.
Bush's base of white evangelicals continues in the tradition of those who ""have cut off their economic noses to spite black faces since the end of the Civil War.""ii
As the song says, ""Yesterday's just a memory, tomorrow's not what it's supposed to be.""iii As the election proved, history never ends.
The election also gives credence to the old adage, ""the more things change, the more they remain the same.""
In the face of momentous events and changes in our national lives since 2000, voting patterns and results were remarkably unchanged from that election to this one. With the exception of three states whose razor-thin margins reversed (New Mexico, New Hampshire, and Iowa), the electoral map in 2004 was identical to the electoral map in 2000.
More people voted against George W. Bush than any Presidential candidate in American history, giving him ""the narrowest win for a sitting president since Woodrow Wilson in 1916.""iv
Both sides mobilized their supporters, but the winners did it better — fostering division with precision.
Yesterday's ""family values"" became ""moral values"" — because there are some families they don't like.
3
""Moral values"" trumped terrorism, war, the economy and jobs for 20% of voters, 80% of whom supported George W. Bush. A shift of 70,000 votes in Ohio would have cost Bush the Presidency. But Ohio, the state that suffered the greatest job loss in the nation, went to Bush, thanks to a same-sex marriage amendment on the ballot.
Vote totals show an America divided: men versus women, whites versus non-whites, married versus unmarried, straight versus gay, old versus young, conservatives versus liberals, Protestants versus Jews, rural Americans versus urbanites.
So we have a country divided roughly 50/50 but a government held entirely by one side.
Most of us would rather have had the election turn on issues of war and peace than on issues of race and sex. I thought we had 10 commandments. What happened to the ones against lying, stealing, and killing?
Bill Clinton may have lied in the war between the sexes. George W. Bush lied about war. When Clinton lied, no one died.
First ""weapons of mass destruction"" morphed into ""weapons of mass destruction program-related activities."" Now the hunt for such weapons has come to an end. Just before Christmas it was decided that the ""interim report to Congress that contradicted nearly every postwar assertion made by top Bush Administration officials""v will be adopted as final this spring. But the war — and the killing — go on.
At the NAACP, we have never opposed or supported political parties; instead, we have always opposed political policies that are wrong. And we oppose the war in Iraq!vi

This year marks the 50th anniversary of the Montgomery Bus Boycott — the event that brought Rosa Parks and Martin Luther King, Jr. to the world.
The noted historian Clayborn Carson writes:
""Although King played a crucial role in transforming a local boycott into a social justice movement of international significance, he was himself transformed by a movement he did not initiate.vii
Our own Ella Baker, the former Director of Branches, put it more succinctly. She said:
""The movement made Martin rather than Martin making the movement.""

[A handwritten X mark appears in the right margin, pointing out the revision in the previous section.]
In Montgomery the boycott owed its success to what Carson calls the:
""self-reliant NAACP stalwarts who acted on their own before King could lead.""viii

Four days after Rosa Parks stood up for justice by sitting down, the boycott began. That evening, at the first mass meeting, King declared:
""... When the history books are written in the future, somebody will have to say, 'there lived a race of people, a black people ... who had the moral courage to stand up for their rights. And thereby they injected a new meaning into the veins of history and civilization.""ix

King did not exaggerate. Montgomery was the beginning of a mass movement that destroyed segregation and permanently changed our world.
Thus it is no coincidence that this year we also celebrate the 40th anniversary of the passage of the Voting Rights Act.
You'll remember a few weeks ago, President Bush had back-to-back meetings with two groups of black people. The first was with a group of
5
hand-picked black ""leaders"" — several of them members of that new political party. You've heard of the Democratic and Republican parties; They're called the ""Dems"" or the ""GOP"" — this one is the FBGP — The Faith-Based Grant Party. It is headquartered in Washington, DC, and it gave more than $1 billion dollars in grants in 2003. This was a meeting with many of the grant recipients — the neo-cons meeting with the theo-cons.
That first meeting was held to distract attention from the meeting the President held the next day with people whose leadership is earned, not bestowed or bequeathed — the 43 members of the Congressional Black Caucus. Their leadership is certified by the millions of Black Americans who voted for them. This was the first meeting the full Caucus had with the President in four years.
The most noteworthy aspect of this meeting was hardly reported in the mainstream press.
Toward the end of the meeting, when the President was asked by Representative Jesse Jackson, Jr. whether he would support reauthorization of the Voting Rights Act, the President said he was ""unfamiliar"" with the Act.x
""Unfamiliar"" with the 1965 Voting Rights Act? The Department of Justice's own website describes it as 'the most successful piece of civil rights legislation ever adopted by the United States Congress.""xi
We're seeking a face-to-face meeting between President Bush and NAACP leadership so we can familiarize him with the Voting Rights Act and the rest of our agenda.
Another event upstaged and obscured by the President's meeting with the Faith-Based Grant Party was the historic meeting of four black Baptist organizations, 10,000 strong, the same week. It too went almost entirely
6
unreported in the mainstream media. If they had reported it, the public would know that the black Baptists:

declared their opposition to the war in Iraq and the appointment of Alberto Gonzalez as Attorney General;
called for a higher minimum wage, discontinuation of the tax cuts for the wealthy, new investment in public education, and reauthorization of the Voting Rights Act; and
stopping privatization of prison construction, reinvesting in children's health insurance, and global relief for black nations such as the Sudan and Haiti.xii

The losers of last fall's election have rightly been urged to study and learn from their mistakes; the winners ought to examine why they failed to penetrate the black political consensus.
Now they are trying to tell us that privatizing Social Security would be beneficial to black people. This is because, they say, blacks don't live as long as whites.
It isn't Social Security that's a bad deal for blacks — dying too early is the real bad deal!
They'd rather play the race card than actually address blacks' shorter life expectancy.
Using shorter black life expectancy as an excuse for privatizing Social Security isn't just offensive; it is also misleading. The black-white disparity in life expectancies practically disappears at retirement age. If they really cared about black life expectancy, they'd fix health care, which is really broken. They'd fix the black-white unemployment gap — joblessness for blacks is always twice the rate for whites. They'd fix the prison gap — more black men are in prison than in college. They'd find ways to end the

numerous threats to long life and to extend our lives. Instead, they want to turn Social Security into broker security. This argument isn't about Main Street; it's about Wall Street.
Privatization is another effort to reward wealthy Americans at the expense of working Americans, particularly black working Americans, asking them to play the lottery with their future.xiii
Social Security is the sole source of income for 40% of elderly blacks. Privatization would convert their support from a guarantee to a gamble, from a right to a risk.
Their so-called reform is a solution without a problem. It is part of an all-out attack on the underpinnings of the progressive spirit in America.
Social Security has a progressive benefit structure. That is, it provides higher benefits, relative to earnings, for lower-wage over higher-wage earners. It is this progressiveness that offends the Administration and caused it to target Social Security as its number one priority.
But Social Security isn't the only target. Having starved the government with tax cuts for the rich, they now propose a budget which will punish the poor.
Among other things, the Bush Budget would:

renege on the President's promise of $12 billion in school funding;
eliminate childcare assistance for 300,000 children by 2009;
eliminate the Even Start literacy program;
cut Medicaid for 1.8 million low-income children; and
cut food stamps for up to 300,000 working poor.

The budget tells us the real meaning of the so-called ""ownership"" society — it means a society where, unless you're rich, you're on your own.
8
We've gone from gated communities to gated government — where government exists to protect the wealthy, locking out all the rest.
This is not the America for which we have fought and died. We do not intend to sit idly by as this assault on our values continues.
And — we will not be silenced.
The great abolitionist, William Lloyd Garrison, over 100 years ago, described what we must do now.
He said:
""I will be harsh as truth, and as uncompressing as justice. On this subject, I do not wish to think, or write, with moderation. No! No! Tell a man whose house is on fire to give a moderate alarm; tell him to moderately rescue his wife from the hands of a ravisher; tell the mother to gradually extricate her babe from the fire into which it has fallen; but urge me not to use moderation in a cause like the present!""xiv

Weeks before last year's election, the NAACP received a letter from the Internal Revenue Service. We were being audited, the IRS said, because in my speech at our Convention in July, I had ""condemned"" the President's economic, education, and war policies.
I had. This is the job of the Board Chairman of the country's oldest and largest civil rights organization, to criticize policies when they conflict with the interests of our members and the communities they represent. That is our mission. That is our mandate.
And it is our right — the right of the NAACP — to speak truth to power.
We have done it for all of our 96 years, so this is not the first time the NAACP and the movement for justice have faced the wrath and the threats of the powerful.
9
In 1956, the Attorneys General of Alabama and Louisiana sought to cripple the NAACP by demanding our membership lists.
We said, ""No!
Similar demands were made by the states of Virginia and Texas — and we said, ""No!""
Despite the threats to our very existence, despite the intimidation, in no state did we divulge the names of our members or our supporters. It took nearly a decade and the United States Supreme Court to validate our position and end their threats.xv
Sometimes the harassment has been more subtle and secretive. The FBI often hid behind the coward's tool — anonymous letters. President Nixon used the IRS in pursuit of those on his enemies list. The President's counselor, Karl Rove, has an enemies list, too, and he told The New Yorker magazine in 2003 that we are on it.xvi And we now know that it was complaints from two Congressmen which prompted the IRS investigation.
We intend to fight what we regard as a blatant violation of our constitutional rights. We are heartened by the support we have received across the country. The response to our first fund-raising appeal outlining the IRS investigation was astounding, and we received many inspirational letters.
One man wrote:
""I am a member of several Republican organizations and if it is all right with you I intend to let them know they have stepped over the boundary.""xvii

But my favorite was this. She wrote:
""I am 97 years old. ... Sadly, I have ignored all your recent appeals but when your December 10, 2004 letter came I knew it was
10
the catalyst I needed to respond to this outrageous attack on the NAACP.""xviii
She enclosed $1000.
And so we will, in the spirit of our founders and all those who have gone before, defend ourselves against ""this outrageous attack.""
This year marks another anniversary — the 100th anniversary of the Niagara Movement, the precursor organization to the NAACP, led by Dr. W. E. B. DuBois. In observance of that historic event, Vice-Chair Roslyn Brock is hosting ""Leadership 500 Summit"", a meeting of young professionals, in Sandestin, Florida, over Memorial Day weekend — May 26 to 29. This will be an opportunity to demonstrate and strengthen our cross-generational appeal and attract a new generation to our social justice agenda, and we urge you all to support this important gathering.
As we confront the IRS and the continuing existence of racial discrimination, we are bolstered by DuBois' words from the Niagara Movement's second session.
He said:
""We claim for ourselves every right that belongs to a free-born American — political, civil and social — and until we get these rights, we shall never cease to protest and assail the ears of America with the story of its shameful deeds toward us.""xix

Ms. Moore, Friends 
It is such a treat to see Yolanda King; for many years in Atlanta we were neighbors, living two houses apart. She was Yoki then.
We all know she is the daughter of the country's premier apostle of peace and justice, but let us not forget she is also the daughter of a dynamic woman who carries on her husband's work today.

One hundred years ago, W. E. B. DuBois published The Souls of Black Folk, famously predicting that the problem of the 20th Century would be the problem of the color line.
Fifty years ago President Harry Truman desegregated the American military.
Forty years ago last month, NAACP field Secretary Medgar Evers was assassinated in Jackson, Mississippi.
And forty years ago next month, Martin Luther King, Jr., fresh from the battlefields of Birmingham, told the nation of his dream at the March on Washington.
And We meet in a place state where NAACP history dates to 1915, when the first Florida branch was started in Key West. In 1916 W. E. B. DuBois came to Florida to energize our members, as we gather this week to be energized again.
In 1917, James Weldon Johnson, himself a native Floridian, organized Branches in Florida in his capacity as our first National Field Secretary.
By 1926, perhaps decimated by World War I, not a single dues-paying Florida Branch existed, but the NAACP stayed in the fight. It took Chambers v. Florida to the United States Supreme Court, saving an innocent black man from the electric chair. In 1940, NAACP attorneys filed suit to equalize teachers' salaries, the first such suit in the South.
When the Florida State Conference was formed in 1941, Harry T. Moore became its President and later its full-time Executive Secretary along with officers E. D. Davis, W. J. H. Black, Frank Burts, Emma Pickett, Mamie Mike, and K. S. Johnson.
4
On Christmas night 1951, Harry T. Moore and his wife, Harriet, joined the ranks of civil rights martyrs when the KKK bombed their home, killing them both. This occasion honors them and
Moore's successor was Robert W. Saunders, Sr., who died this last year. When Bob Saunders replaced Harry T. Moore, he stepped into big footprints, but he more than filled them. He was brave and daring and innovative and hard working — and we all miss him terribly.
After Brown v. Board, Thurgood Marshall targeted Florida, saying of the state:
""We found not one instance on the part of the political leadership . . . to even consider the possibility of desegregating.""

[And handwritten mark appears in the left margin next to the previous quote.]
The NAACP sued the school system here in Dade County.
Florida fought back. They formed an infamous body, known as the Johns Committee, to investigate the NAACP, and it ""embarked on a witch-hunt that would last for years.""ii
But the NAACP helped to force desegregation in the public schools of 20 Florida counties and attacked segregation statewide — at service stations, cafeterias, in the Florida National Guard, and the University of Florida. The list goes on and on.
As Bob Saunders wrote of the NAACP's role in Florida during the 1960s,
""We welcomed others to the fight. . . . Still, we were here before the others came, and we were there after some of them left.""iii

And we're still here!
5
The Florida NAACP story is full of champions — Father Theodore Gibson, Reverends A. Leon Lowery and C. K. Steele, Rutledge Pearson, Charles Cherry, Flossie Currington, Ellen P. Greene — the list is long.
Today, Florida is the fourth largest state in the union, with a population becoming more diverse every day. Whites account for 65 percent, blacks 15, Asians 2, and Hispanics 17 percent.
We know that nationally, as in Florida, Hispanics are now the largest minority, and we are reminded of our need to make common cause with all who share our condition and concerns. Although Latinos are less cohesive as a group than blacks — identifying themselves by place of origin rather than race and collectively lacking a shared history in the United States -- blacks and Latinos, as well as other minorities, will move forward fastest if we move forward together.
We've said it again and again — in the NAACP, we believe colored people come in all colors. Anyone who shares our condition, values and concerns is more than welcome.
Although Florida boasts a diverse population and has witnessed a huge growth in its minority student population, its schools — in keeping with national trends — are becoming more segregated. We know that when properly enforced, Brown v. Board of Education does work — because we've seen it work, here in Florida and elsewhere throughout the South.
In 1980, the average black student in Florida, as a result of enforcement efforts under Brown, was attending a school that was half white. By 2000, however, that student's school was only about
6
one-third white.iv We know that ""(s)egregation by race is strongly associated with concentrated poverty and many forms of social inequality.""v
We've tried segregation, and it doesn't work.
Governor Jeb Bush's notion of school reform is going to send black children to reform schools. His exit tests threaten to bar third-graders from advancing to fourth grade and high school seniors from graduation. Florida loses nearly half of its Black and Hispanic students before they graduate.vi
Which brings us to Jeb Bush's One Florida Initiative — the first time any state's governor abolished affirmative action in higher education, government employment, and state contracting.
Maybe that's why he's not here — this time, the Supreme Court didn't bail him out.
The Bush brothers are big on preemption. First Governor Jeb Bush became the only governor to carry out a preemptive strike on affirmative action, and then President George Bush carried out a preemptive strike on Iraq, the only President in our nation's history to attack a country which did not threaten or attack us first. Both strikes were unnecessary and unwise.
The NAACP tried unsuccessfully to block the One Florida Initiative, which has turned out to be an abysmal failure. In higher education, race-conscious undergraduate admissions were replaced with the Talented 20 Program. ""There is little evidence,"" despite Governor Bush's premature pronouncements to the contrary, that the Talented 20 Program ""has done anything to change the admissions prospects for Florida's public high school students.""vii
7
Despite this, the President praised his little brother's Talented 20 Program, along with similar programs in Texas and California, as ""race neutral alternatives"" to affirmative action in the Michigan affirmative action cases.viii These percent plans, which guarantee admission to state universities for a fixed percentage of the state's top high school graduates, suffer from numerous deficiencies, not the least of which is that they depend for any success on continued racial segregation in high schools. In the process, they encourage students to remain in low-performing segregated schools and discourage them ""from taking challenging classes that might lower their grade point averages.""ix
And percent plans do nothing to increase minority enrollments in private colleges or graduate and professional schools.
The Administration's brief, of course, discussed none of these infirmities in urging the Supreme Court to consider such ""race neutral"" plans as a viable alternative to affirmative action.
You know the Bush Administration likes to use Secretary of State Colin Powell and National Security Advisor Condoleeza Rice as human shields against any criticism of its record on civil rights. After all, the President is proud of saying, his Administration is more diverse than any in history — except the one that preceded it.
But the day after the administration filed its brief in the Michigan cases, Ms. Rice issued a rare statement on a domestic issue, saying, ""(I)t is appropriate to use race as one factor among others in achieving a diverse student body.""x
And Ms. Rice has acknowledged that affirmative action was responsible for her employment at Stanford University.xi
8
Secretary Powell, for his part, has long been an outspoken advocate for affirmative action, and specifically said he hoped Michigan would prevail in court.
Happily, Secretary Powell got his wish. The Supreme Court held, for the first time, held ""that student body diversity is a compelling state interest that can justify the use of race in university admissions.""xii
The Court struck down the points but upheld the principle. Since the opponents kept telling us that this was all about principle, I'd say we won!
The Supreme Court gave legal sanction to what we knew to be morally, socially, and educationally correct.
We urge all the states which have abandoned race-conscious affirmative action to come back into the Union. We're going to monitor their commitment to the Supreme Court's endorsement of race as a tool in achieving diversity.
Governor Bush, are you listening? We will be heard!
In dissent, Justice Clarence Thomas, affirmative action's poster child, opined that ""every time the government ... makes race relevant to the provision of burdens or benefits, it demeans us all.""xiii
If only he had said that to the first President Bush and, from the lofty perch of principle, declined his nomination to the Supreme Court.
Justice Thomas begins his dissent in the Michigan case by invoking Frederick Douglass for the proposition that black people do not need the government's ""interference"" and want to be ""let alone.""xiv
Justice Thomas ought to recall that Frederick Douglass also said this:
""If the American people could build a schoolhouse in every valley; a church on every hilltop ... and supply them with a teacher and preacher respectively and welcome the descendants of the former slaves to all the moral and

[Pages 9 and 10 are missing.]
11
""(W)e are not far distant from an overtly discriminatory past, and the effects of centuries of law-sanctioned inequality remain painfully evident in our communities and schools.""
""In the wake 'of a system of racial caste only recently ended,' large disparities endure.""xvii

In her ruling Justice Ginsburg acknowledged what we know to be true:
""Unemployment, poverty, and access to health care vary disproportionately by race. Neighborhoods and schools remain racially divided. African-American and Hispanic children are all too often educated in poverty-stricken and under performing institutions. Adult African-Americans and Hispanics generally earn less than whites with equivalent levels of education. Equally credentialed job applicants receive different receptions depending on their race. Irrational prejudice is still encountered in real estate markets and consumer transactions."" xviii

She could have mentioned payday lending. Two years ago, our North Carolina State President and Board member Skip Alston rightly called it ""exploitation, pure and simple. Tolerating this practice is unworthy of a society that claims to value its most vulnerable.""xix
By convention resolutions in 2000 and last year and by a Board resolution this year, we've set binding policy on this issue for the NAACP from the smallest to largest Branches to the national staff. We despise this predatory practice that targets the poor, especially blacks. Charging annual interest rates of 390%, these companies prey on the weak, trapping them in unending cycles of debt. We won't take their money, and we'll do our best to stop them from taking money from others.
We will be heard!
Justice Ginsburg could have included the gross racial inequalities in our criminal justice system. As Richard Pryor said, ""justice is just us!""
12
Although whites and blacks use illegal drugs at roughly the same rate, 55% of all those in jail or prison nationwide for drug violations are black and 30% are Latino.
An estimated 12 percent of black men between the ages of 20 and 34 are incarcerated, the highest rate ever measured.xx Among white men in the same group, the rate is 1.6 percent.
Racial disparities exist throughout the criminal justice system, including in the imposition of the death penalty.
Florida's death row population trails only California and Texas. At least in Florida, the sun recently has shone on wrongful capital convictions. The largest number of cases in which somone was exonerated after being condemned to death row have occured here in the Sunshine State.
Racial disparities also exist throughout our economic system. In 2001, for example, a college-educated white man earned an average salary of $65,000, while black and Hispanic men earned 30% less. The typical white family has a net worth more than eight times larger than that of its black counterpart.
Into this mass economic inequality marches the President for the rich.
The civil rights community was absolutely right when we warned that great harm would come from the foolish, risky tax bill of 2001 that gave millions to the rich. It has become clear that our warnings were absolutely right.
It did not stimulate economic growth. It did not provide tax relief for most Americans. In fact it succeeded only in fulfilling the worst predictions of those of us who opposed it — it squandered a once-in-a-lifetime budget
13
surplus on an unwise tax cut that primarily benefited the weathly, and it continues to threaten Medicare and Social Security Trust Funds.
To make up for just the initial tax cuts, we would have to cut spending by $5 billion dollars five days a week for over a year. That was always the point — not just to further enrich the already wealthy, but also to starve and bleed the government, making it unable to meet human needs, signing a death warrant for social programs for decades and decades to come.
Now they have made matters even worse. Even as our troops were marching forward toward Baghdad, Congress was marching backward toward even greater deficits and even more tax cuts for the rich.
We learned when Ronald Reagan was President that trickle-down economics don't work. Tax cuts don't trickle down — instead they've helped create a downpour of debt and a flood of fiscal disaster for states from coast to coast. The result is swamped state budgets, closed schools and hospitals, and cuts in programs serving the poor.
The nation's governors warn that state deficits are the largest in more than 50 years. Some states are saving money by unscrewing every third light bulb, having teachers serve as janitors, releasing prisoners before their sentences expire, laying off teachers, cutting financial aid, closing schools.
And this in the richest country in the world!
The Administration also has declared its intention to farm out 850,000 federal jobs to private companies. And they've proposed new overtime rules that could cause 8 million workers, including some who earn as little as $22,100 a year, to lose their right to overtime pay.
Their proposal is a job-killer, and an instruction manual to employers on how to lay off workers and force the ones they keep to work double hours for free.
14
The Administration is engaged in a relentless assault on the wage economy, part of its plan to favor the privileged over the people.
The President called his tax giveaway a ""Jobs and Growth"" plan. The only growth we've seen is in millionaires' bank accounts and the number of black people standing in unemployment lines.
Last month year the unemployment rate rose to 6.4 percent, the highest in nine years. And ""the number of employed blacks shrank while the number of employed whites grew.""xxi
The White House says its tax cut has yet to kick in, but the failing economy is already kicking us!
Unemployment for blacks in June was is, as always, more than twice the rate for whites.
You cannot patch the leaky economy — or any other domestic problem — with duct tape and plastic sheets.
You don't show compassion by offering guests at the millionaires' banquet second helpings and an extra dessert.
We would do well to recall the wise counsel of President Franklin Roosevelt who said:
""The test of our progress is not whether we add more to the abundance of those who have much; it is whether we provide enough for those who have too little.""

We are meeting in ""the poorest big city in the United States — poorer than Newark, poorer than Detroit, poorer than any city with a population of 250,000 or more."" Just a few minutes drive away from here is the gateway to Fisher Island, an exclusive enclave that, according to the 2000 census, is the wealthiest community in America.xxii
15
While we add to the abundance of those in Fisher Island, and provide less than ever to the poor in Miami, our nation is regressing, not progressing.
We know there is an appalling double standard played out on Florida's shores between the treatment received by Haitian and Cuban immigrants — the Haitians are given the back of America's hand and the Cubans a hearty handshake and a loud ""welcome aboard.""
One problem faced by hardworking immigrants is found in abundance here in Florida — the exploitation and near peonage of farm workers. Our units here in Florida have worked to improve their lives, and we support efforts nationwide to enable them to earn a decent wage under safe and secure conditions.
We've invited representatives of all the Caribbean nations to come to this convention to share their problems and the problems their nationals face in the United States.
We know America's policy makers often ignore this section of the globe, except as a pawn in the great power struggles of the past.
So too do America's policy makers often ignore Africa, choosing neglect over concern and engagement, so we applaud President Bush's trip there last week. 
But while we are pleased that the President has discovered Africa, the continent needs more than an exotic photo-op presidential visit.
Solutions to Africa's problems must not be dependent on free market fundamentalism. The United States must adopt a multilateral approach to African problems generated by colonialism's legacy and decades of war, famine, and autocratic leadership. We must work for cancellation of Africa's unsustainable and largely illegitimate debt. We must fully fund the fight against Africa's AIDS pandemic, not just fret over it. Africa deserves her

And we cannot help but be outraged by the overthrow at Haiti's elected democratic government with the complicity of the United States

fair share of American attention, American trade, and American aid. Egypt and Israel alone receive as much US aid as do all the African nations south of the Sahara.xxiii
Just as we have work to do abroad, we have work to do at home. This Administration has not been good for civil rights. It has not been good for civil liberties. It has not been good for democracy.
What better place than here and what better time than now to recall the travesty of the 2000 election.
You all know the story — Governor Bush' administration hired a firm to purge the voter rolls, and purge them they did, removing the qualified and the ineligible with equal eagerness, 94,000 in all. This was truly a weapon of mass voting rights destruction.xxiv
By the way, the man who ran that purge got a reward — today he is in the Voting Rights Section of the Department of Justice as Counsel to the Assistant Attorney General for Civil Rights.
Winesses told the sorry story of voter suppression and nullification in Florida at our hearings after the election. They described police stops near polling places, demands for multiple form of identification from people who had voted for decades, long-time voters' names missing from the rolls, a long and too-familiar litany of the sorts of activities practiced for years across the country to keep racial minorities from the polls.
With our coalition partners we filed and won a lawsuit, NAACP v. Smith, and received promises that what happened in 2000 will not happen again. But is has been happening for years, in Florida and elsewhere across the country.
17
The Chief Justice of the Supreme Court tried to keep Hispanics from voting in his native Arizona as a young lawyer; that experience must have served him well when Bush v. Gore came before hims years later.
Despite all this, black Americans voted with the American majority on Election Day 2000. NAACP efforts then helped increase the African-American share of the total vote by 25 percent or more in four states. Two million more voters cast ballots in 2000 than did in 1996. Turnout in Texas increased 50 percent, in Florida by 60 percent, and in Missouri by a whopping 124 percent! More than a million African-Americans voted here in Florida, accounting for 15 percent of the total — a state record.
We did less well in 2002 — and you saw the result.
But what happened in the 2002 midterms elections also illustrated the politicization of patriotism and terrorrism. In the Georgia Senate race, the Republicans used false patriotism to destroy a true patriot.
The incumbent, Max Cleland, is was a Vietnam War veteran. He lost his right arm and both legs in battle. He also lost his Senate seat — when his opponent questioned his patriotism. Cleland had voted against the Homeland Security Act because it didn't provide protection for workers' rights.
His opponent ran an ad with pictures of Osama bin Laden and Saddam Hussein, implying that the war veteran and triple amputee didn't love his country enough to help in the nation's fight against terrorists.
Republican Senator John McCain called the add ""worse than disgraceful, it's reprehensible.""xxv
If Hispanics, blacks and whites turnout in 2004 in the same percentages as they did in 2000, the no-show National Guardsman in the White House and his draft avoiding Vice President will lose by three million votes.xxvi
18
That's why voter registration and voter turnout must be a top priority for every Branch and every State Conference from now to election day. The countdown starts now. If a Branch isn't registering voters and isn't preparing now for grassroots turnout program next year, it isn't doing its jobs.
Martin Luther King, Jr. said, ""You are what you do!"" What you do between now and election day next year will decide who you are — and will decide what kind of world we live in.
We've invited all of the Democratic candidates for President to a forum here. By their presence and their words, they will let you know that they are interested in your vote.
We invited the Republican candidate for President too, but he can't come. He couldn't come last year when we were in his home state — and so was he. He couldn't come to our Annual Convention in New Orleans two years ago either.
But he did come to our convention in Baltimore — when he was a candidate, and we hope he will honor the invitation we intend to issue next year.
We are and always have been nonpartisan. We've never endorsed a candidate for public office or a political party, and we never will.
But being nonpartisan doesn't mean being non-critical. And it doesn't even mean criticizing all parties equally. If the Democrats were doing anything, we'd criticized them too.
But one party controls the presidency, the Congress, and the Supreme Court — all three branches of the national government. And the press increasingly reflects and reinforces this one-party control.
19
One party repeatedly plays the race card, appealing to the dark underside of American culture, to that minority of Americans who reject democracy and equality.
In coded racial appeals, they embrace Confederate leaders as patriots and wallow in a victim mentality.
They preach racial neutrality and practice racial division. They celebrate Martin Luther King and misuse his message.
Their idea of reparations is to give war criminal Jefferson Davis a pardon.
Their idea of equal rights is the American flag and Confederate swastika flying side by side.
Speaking of the Confederate swastika, my former home state of Georgia rates last in the nation in SAT scores. Before they think about about raising the Confederate flag again, they ought to raise their SAT scores!
We meet as our nation seems doomed to a punishing war of occupation in Iraq, war whose rationale has changed repeatedly — before it started and today. Theirs was an ever shifting and constantly rotating reason for war — first regime change, then ties to terrorrism, and then the invisible weapons of mass destruction.
Last fall the NAACP opposed unilateral war against Iraq, but we do not confuse opposition to the war with a lack of support for our fighting forces. We commend the bravery and sacrifice of our women and men in uniform, who represent all races and faiths.
More than most of American society, our military reflects the diversity of our nation. We mourn the lives lost, almost 20% of them black, almost twice the percentage of African-Americans in the population.
20
We have invited Specialist Shoshanna Johnson, the brave African American woman taken prisoner during the war, to attend our Military Affairs Dinner Wednesday night.
But we'll continue to have our say.
At the NAACP, we long ago learned our lesson about not speaking out in times of war.
In the summer of 1918, on the eve of America's entry into World War I, one of our founders, Dr. W. E. B. DuBois, urged blacks ""to forget our special grievances and close ranks shoulder to shoulder with our fellow citizens and the allied nations that are fighting for democracy.""
The criticism he faced then was immediate and loud. He quickly reversed his position and realized then — as we must realize now — that when wars are fought to save democracy, the first casualty is usually democracy itself.
We ought to remember the words of Ohio Senator Robert Taft, who said two weeks after Pearl Harbor was attacked:
""I believe there there can be no doubt that criticism in time of war is essential to the maintenance of any kind of democratic government.""

And the words of President Theodore Roosevelt, who said in 1918,
""To announce that there must be no criticism of the President, or to stand by the President, right or wrong, is not only unpatriotic and servile, but is morally treasonous to the American public.""

So we will continue to oppose any nominee to the federal courts who opposes us — such as William Pryor, whose nomination to this Circuit's Court of Appeals is pending. Pryor, currently Alabama's Attorney General,
21
is a right wing extremist. He has consistently demonstated hostility toward civil rights and voting rights. His nomination is an affront and his confirmation would be a disaster.
As war continues abroad, the attack on our liberties at home marches on.
We who know firsthand the evils of racial profiling must not tolerate its use against others in the name of national security. We also know firsthand the evils of law enforcement choosing their targets based on advocacy and association.
We have an attorney general who has abandoned the ""attorney"" part of his title. He has cast aside civilian courts in favor of military tribunals. He has ""seized for himself the power to monitor confidential attorney-client conversations without judicial oversight. The USA Patriot Act allows agents to seize business records, search a home or get information about a person's web surfing activity with minimal judicial review. It also allows the FBI to monitor telephone or email communications without demonstrating probable cause.""xxvii
We ought to remind John Ashcroft that the holiday we celebrate each July 4th commemorates revolutionaries who threw off the chains of privilege and arrogant power that were then — and remain today — the primary threats to freedom and human advancement.
If a dead man beat John Ashcroft in 2000, surely we can beat back his ideological assault on our Constitution.
Many Some of you remember when Senator Paul Wellstone addressed us at our convention in Minneapolis. Since last we met, we lost this powerful voice for the powerless. But he speaks to us still:
22
""I do not believe the future will belong to those who are content with the present. ... The future will belong to those who have passion, and to those grassroots heroes who are willing to make the personal commitment to make our country better. The future will belong to those who believe in the beauty of their dreams.""

The future belongs to us. We will be heard.

One month later, on May 17th, 1954, the United States Supreme Court, in Brown v. Board of Education, unanimously declared that segregated schools violated the Constitution's promise of equal protection.
As we commemorate the 50th anniversary of that landmark decision, it is easy to cast a cynical eye on the status of school desegregation in America today — or the sorry state of race relations — and minimize the significance of Brown. That is a grave mistake, for Brown — by destroying segregation's legality, gave a nonviolent army the power to destroy segregation's morality as well.
Thus it is no coincidence that this year we also celebrate the 40th anniversary of the passage of the 1964 Civil Rights Act — the most sweeping civil rights legislation before or since, and our democracy's finest hour.
When he sent what would become the 1964 Civil Rights Act to Congress, President John F. Kennedy said:
""When Americans are sent to Viet Nam or West Berlin, we do not ask for whites only.""

Today, when Americans are being sent to Afghanistan and Iraq, we do not ask for whites only.
2
So 2004, as we commemorate these anniversaries, is a time to examine our present in relation to our past. And, as we prepare for and engage in national elections, 2004 will be a time for an examination of our present in relation to our future.
We look back on the years between Brown and the passage of the 1964 Civil Rights Act with some pride.
Martin Luther King's first national address was at a 1957 Prayer Pilgrimage on the third anniversary of Brown at the Lincoln Memorial.
In 1963 alone, the year that King — fresh from the battlefields of Birmingham — told the nation of his dream at the March on Washington, there were more than 10,000 anti-racist demonstrations.
King was the most famous and well known of the modern movement's personalities, but it was a people's movement. It produced leaders of its own; but it relied not on the noted but the nameless, not on the famous but the faceless. It didn't wait for commands from afar. It saw wrong and acted against it; it saw injustice and brought it down.
Those were the days when women and men of all races and creeds worked together in the cause of civil rights.
Those were the days when good music was popular and popular music was good. Those were the days when the President picked the Supreme Court and not the other way around.
Those were the days when we had a war on poverty, not a war on the poor. Those were the days when patriotism was a reason for open-eyed disobedience, not an excuse for blind allegiance.
Those were the days when the news media really was ""fair and balanced"" and not just stenographers for the powerful.
But those were not ""the good old days.""
3
In those days, ""(t)he law, the courts, the schools, and almost every institution ... favored whites. This was white supremacy.""i
This was a massive system of racial preferences, a vast affirmative action plan for whites — enforced by law and terror. Its aims were to crush one portion of the population and enshrine permanent advantage to another. It began with slave-catching in Africa, and it continues on to the present day. [A handwritten X mark appears in the right margin, pointing out the revision in the previous paragraph.]
Only when we acknowledge the name, nature and scope of the problem can we measure the magnitude of our success — and the costs of our failures.
Brown was the movement's greatest legal victory.
There can be no mistake — those fifty years since Brown have seen the fortunes of black America advance and retreat, but the decision is always cause for sober celebration, not impotent dismay.
That the quest for meaningful equality — political and economic equity — remains unfulfilled today is no indictment of past efforts. It is a testament to our challenge.
We meet as our nation is engaged in an unwise war of occupation in the Persian Gulf, war without reason or necessity, war whose primary rationale has now morphed from weapons of mass destruction to ""weapons of mass destruction-related program activities,"" and a retroactive justification of concern for democracy and human rights. The war in Iraq has created what its sponsors told us was the cause — a breeding ground for terrorism and a population whose hatred of America grows by the day.
When Martin Luther King spoke out against the war in Vietnam in 1965, he was revolted at the hypocrisy of America's claims for freedom overseas when blacks enjoyed few freedoms here. War abroad, he said, stole from Americans at home.
4
""The pursuit of widened war,"" he said in 1966, ""has narrowed domestic welfare programs, making the poor, white and Negro, bear the heaviest burden at the front and at home.""
How sadly true those words ring today.
We pray America's twin towers — freedom and justice — are still standing, but in a precarious state, .toetering sharply to the right It is our job to keep upright what others would weaken and destroy. America is strongest when she is just; she is fiercest when her people are free.  [Two handwritten X marks appear in the right margin, pointing out the revisions in the previous paragraph.]
The NAACP, whose Board I chair, has always been non-partisan, but that doesn't mean we're non-critical.
For as long as we've existed, whether Democrats or Republicans have occupied the White House, we're spoken truth to power.
When we were founded in 1909, Theodore Roosevelt was ending his second term. He shared traits with many of today's Negrophobes — he liked individual African-Americans but believed the mass were less than human.
His successor, William Howard Taft, said his ""little brown brothers"" — that's us — would need ""fifty to 100 years"" to become equal with whites.
Woodrow Wilson, who institutionalized segregation in the federal bureaucracy, succeeded Taft. The NAACP's James Weldon Johnson said of him, ""My distrust and dislike ... came nearer to constituting keen hatred for an individual than anything I have ever felt.""
Warren Harding, who followed, joked with Johnson about the rumor Harding had African-American blood; where have we heard that before? Whatever kind of blood he had, Harding had neither the heart nor courage to right the wrongs that afflicted black people.
NAACP Executive Secretary Walter White was prescient in the Coolidge years when he said, ""the Republicans will absorb the anti-Negro
5
south and become ... the relatively anti-Negro party, while the Negro will find refuge in the Democratic Party.""
White said the next President, Herbert Hoover, showed nothing ""to indicate he regarded Negroes as citizens and human beings.""
Franklin Roosevelt served almost four terms. By the time he died in office in 1945 his economic policies and the personality and politics of first lady Eleanor Roosevelt had hastened black conversion to the Democratic Party.
Harry Truman became the first President to speak to an NAACP audience.
The next President, Dwight Eisenhower, told ""nigger jokes"" in the White House. But he made some black appointments, and his reward was 60% of the black vote against Adlai Stevenson in 1956, temporarily reversing the black slide to the Democrats that Franklin Roosevelt had begun.
John F. Kennedy's 1960 campaign reversed the Eisenhower shift toward Republicans when he pledged to eliminate housing segregation ""with the stroke of a pen"" and when he made a famous telephone call — ignored in the mainstream press — to the wife of jailed Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.
An assassin's bullet brought Lyndon Johnson to office — and he pursued civil rights as had no president before him and no president since. The Civil Rights Act of 1964 and Voting Rights Act of 1965 are part of his legacy.
But the passage of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and the Voting Rights Act of 1965 marked the beginning of the dependence of the Republican Party on the politics of racial division to win elections and gain power. By playing the race card in election after election, they've appealed to the dark
6
underside of American culture, to the minority of Americans who reject democracy and equality.
They preach racial neutrality and practice racial division. They celebrate Martin Luther King and misuse his message.
Their idea of reparations is to give war criminal Jefferson Davis a pardon.
Their idea of a pristine environment is a parking lot before the lines are painted in.
Their idea of equal rights is the American flag and Confederate swastika flying side by side.
Their idea of compassion is to ask the guests at the millionaires' banquet if they want an extra helping and a second dessert.
They've tried to patch the leaky economy — and every other domestic problem — with duct tape and plastic sheets.
They write a new Constitution for Iraq and ignore the Constitution here at home.
They draw their most rabid supporters from the Taliban wing of American politics. INSERT — right wing nuts? [A handwritten square with a question mark appears in the right margin, pointing out the possible content insertion in the previous paragraph.]
Now they want to write bigotry back into the Constitution; they want to make one group of Americans outsiders to our common heritage. They want to do what has never been done before — to amend the Constitution to create a group of second-class citizens. Our Constitution is the last hope of freedom; it cannot become the carrier of prejudice and intolerance.
And what about the opposition party? Too often they're not an opposition; they're an amen corner.
With some notable exceptions, they have been absent without leave from the battle for America's soul.
7
When one party is shameless, the other party cannot afford to be spineless.
Our economic imbalances not only mean difficult times for many, they also undermine democratic values. The danger is that plutocracy will prevail over democracy, and the free market will rule over the free citizen.
The reason for the current deficit and the vanished surplus can be placed squarely on the tax giveaways to the rich.
To make up for just the initial tax cuts, we would have to cut spending by $5 billion dollars 5 days a week for over a year. That was the whole point — to further enrich the already wealthy and to starve the government, making it unable to meet human needs, signing a death warrant for social programs for decades to come.
The nation has lost more than 2.5 million jobs in the last three years. Unemployment for blacks is — as always — twice the rate for whites.
We have a President who talks like a populist and governs for the privileged.
We were promised compassionate conservatism; instead, we got crony capitalism.
We have an Attorney General who is a cross between J. Edgar Hoover and Jerry Falwell.
We have a Senate Majority Leader who has voted consistently against labor rights, against civil rights, and against women's rights. And he's the one who replaced the bad guy!
Only one Senator — Russell Feingold of Wisconsin — voted against the first hastily prepared and ill-considered terrorism measure proposed after September 11.
He explained his vote this way:
8
""If we lived in a country that allowed the police to search our home at any time for any reason; if we lived in a country that allowed the government to open your mail, eavesdrop on your phone conversations, or intercept your email communications; if we lived in a country that allowed the government to hold people indefinitely in jail based on what they write or think, or based on mere suspicion that they are up to no good, the government would no doubt discover and arrest more terrorists. But that probably would not be a country in which we would want to live.""ii

Nor do we want to live in a country that permits infiltration and surveillance of religious and political organizations. Yet, the new FBI guidelines proposed by J. Edgar Ashcroft do just that.
We thought we had put a stop to Hoover's programs of spies and lies in the 1970s after these abuses were exposed. Now, under the guise of fighting terrorism, the FBI is going back to spying on law-abiding citizens.
War and fear often cause hasty mistakes, costly both in economic and human terms. We need to remember what we are fighting for.
In the summer of 1918, on the eve of America's entry into World War I, one of the NAACP's founders, W. E. B. DuBois, urged blacks to:
""...forget our special grievances and close ranks shoulder to shoulder with our fellow citizens and the allied nations that are fighting for democracy.""

The criticism he faced then was immediate and loud. He quickly reversed his position and realized then — as we must now — that calls for a retreat from our rights are always wrong.
He understood then — as we must now — that when wars are fought to save democracy, the first casualty is usually democracy itself.
That is why we must be vigilant against the steady erosion of American values and the basic rights we hold dear.
9
We ought to remember the words of President Theodore Roosevelt, who said in 1918,
""To announce there must be no criticism of the President, or to stand by the President, right or wrong, is not only unpatriotic and servile, but is morally treasonous to the American public.""

And the words of Ohio Senator Robert Taft, who said two weeks after Pearl Harbor had been attacked:
""I believe there can be no doubt that criticism in time of war is essential to the maintenance of any kind of democratic government.""

The FBI and the CIA kept files on me in the 1960's; they may be keeping files on me today. While they were watching and following and photographing and wiretapping those of us working nonviolently in the freedom movement, a wave of white terrorism was sweeping across the South unchallenged. It has taken 40 years and more to bring a pitiful few of those terrorists to justice.
And it has taken 40 years and more to put in place a framework for civil rights enforcement, now threatened on several fronts.
The Administration's judicial nominees are hostile to the basic principles of civil rights and civil rights enforcement. They oppose the core constitutional principle of ""one person, one vote."" They've supported federal funding for racially discriminatory schools. They've tried to re-write anti-discrimination laws from the bench, and they've eroded Congressional authority to pass laws that protect civil rights.iii
Among those staffing the Voting Rights Section of the Justice Department is a lawyer who helped run the purge of Florida's voting rolls before the 2000 election. Another is a former senior counsel for the
10
misnamed Center for Equal Opportunity, founded to fight laws requiring racial justice in America.
Organizations dedicated to overturning the gains of the civil rights movement are now dictating public policy. They will not rest until white preferences are restored.
Their very names are fraudulent, and their aims are frightening.
They have already stolen our vocabulary, and they want to steal the just spoils of our righteous war. Sophisticated and well funded, over the past decade they have won several victories in the plot to dismantle justice and fair play.
For more than a decade, they have waged ideological war against moderation in the federal judiciary and then squealed the loudest when the extremists they support are rejected.
Now they have ascended to unprecedented positions of power within the federal government.
There is a right wing conspiracy, and it controls the administration, both houses of Congress, much of the judiciary, and a major portion of the media.
President Bush chose Martin Luther King's birthday this year to unilaterally elevate Charles Pickering to the federal bench — his hostility to civil rights and leniency to cross burners notwithstanding.
He chose Martin Luther King's birthday last year to announce that, even though he admits society continues to do something special against racial minorities,iv his administration would not do anything special for them; he opposed the University of Michigan's efforts to promote diversity among its student body.
11
I was afraid to listen to his speech at the Brown commemoration in Topeka two weeks ago —afraid he'd announce repeal the 14th Amendment.
The election this fall is a contest between two widely disparate views of who we are and what we believe. One view wants to march us backward through history — surrendering control of government to special interests, weakening democracy, giving religion veto power over science, curtailing civil liberties, despoiling the environment.
The other view promises expanded democracy and giving the people, not plutocrats, control over their government.
Grover Norquist explained what he sees at stake in November. He told Elizabeth Drew:
""If after the election Kerry is the president but Republicans control the House and Senate we can keep him from getting anybody up on the Supreme Court, we won't let him raise taxes. No part of the Republican coalition would be damaged or destroyed by a Kerry victory. But with another four years of Bush, labor unions will decline further. We'll get tort reform which will cost the trial lawers millions and millions. We'll be reducing government employees, which will hurt the public employee unions. There's no opportunity for a united Democratic government. There is an opportunity for a united Republican government.""v

Yes — the stakes are high, higher than ever in recent memory, and the consequences of loss almost too dire to bear.
By the year 2050, although African-Americans are thewill remain our nation's largest racial minority, blacks and Hispanics together will be 40% of the nation's population and will remain so in the future. Their centrality to victory in 2004 cannot be overlooked or left to last-minute afterthoughts or early November drive-by politics. [A handwritten X mark appears in the right margin, pointing out the revisions in the previous paragraph.]
We must insure every citizen registers and votes and guarantee the
12
irregularities, suppression, nullification, and outright theft of black votes that happened on Election Day 2000 never, ever happen again.
These votes can be a reward for advancing justice or punishment for betrayal — we're tired of fattening frogs for snakes.
Election 2000 confirmed our deep national divisions. Not only did Al Gore receive 90% of the black vote and George W. Bush a majority of the white vote, whites made up 95 percent of Bush's total votes.
Although 57 percent of voters with incomes under $15,000 voted for Gore, even poor whites cast a majority of their votes for Bush. Similarly, 54 percent of women voted for Gore, but white women slightly favored Bush. In politics, as in life, race trumps class and race trumps gender.
The election revealed a cultural, as well as a racial divide. Gore won every major city and almost all suburbs, while Bush took every small town on a straight line from Redding, California to Springfield, Illinois — giving new meaning to Woody Guthrie's old song — ""This Land Is Your Land, This Land Is My Land.""
The only demographic groups that cast a unified vote were blacks, Latinos, Jews, union members, and residents of large cities — all of whom voted 60 percent or more for Gore, and white males, who voted 60 percent for Bush.
We know these divisions for the most part have deepened since the last election, so this divide pretty much tells us where we must begin.
As Any long-suffering Red Sox fans ought to know — your team won't win if you don't touch the bases — or if you run too far outside the base path.
You cannot win this race by ignoring America's social divide race. In the 50th anniversary year of Brown, we have a chance to become the first nation in human history to wholly assimilate a racially distinct former slave class. [Two handwritten X marks appear in the right margin, pointing out the revisions in the previous two paragraphs.]
?This means (what how does not ignoring race translate into a campaign/political strategy?)
13
We know that if whites and non-whites vote in the same percentages as they did in 2000, Bush will be re-defeated by 3 million votes.
And we know that blacks are increasingly angry about the economy and the war. Our unemployment rate is almost double that for whites. A recent poll in six key states — Ohio, Pennsylvania, Missouri, Florida, Michigan, and Nevada — found that 73 percent of blacks believe Iraq is not worth fighting for and a whopping 77 percent believe that Bush intentionally mislead the nation about the war.
These are voters ready to turn anger into action, to work for regime change here at home. But they have to be asked. They have to be registered, organized, and mobilized. And not just by the welcome new organizations with large treasuries. We have to use existing grassroots organizations that have a track record and their community's trust.
And we must be ready for a repetition of the systematic attempts to intimidate minority voters that have been the hallmark of Republican Party campaign efforts for the last 40 years. If we want to count on these voters, we have to insure them that their votes will count.
Black Americans have always worshiped at the altar of the American ideal, believing deeply in participatory democracy. Together with other minorities and like-minded whites, we can, in the words of the poet Langston Hughes:
""Let America be America again.
Let it be the dream it used to be.
Let it be the pioneer on the plain,
Seeking a home where he himself is free.
14
O, let my land be a land where liberty
Is crowned with no false patriotic wreath,
But opportunity is real, and life is free,
Equality is in the air we breathe.
O, yes,
I say it plain,
American never was America to me,
And yet I swear this oath —
America will be!""

It is always a pleasure for me to come to this section of Pennsylvania; I grew up at Lincoln University in Chester County. I went to school in Bucks County. Philadelphia was the big, big city as far back as I can remember.
So it is always a treat to be in this region — it summons up memories that are an important part of my life.
Today I am a history pr teacher, and I want to talk about our history.
Writing about African influences in America, Temple University Professor Brenda Dixon said:
""As a culture existing within a culture for so long, the Afro-centric web of influence in America is a tangled mass of intricate relationships, both voluntary and involuntary, both concealed and obvious. Many instances of the relationship have been shrouded — sometimes inadvertently, but all too frequently with malicious intent.""1

Professor Dixon was writing about dance, but she might have been writing about American society as a whole.
The study of Black History — in Pennsylvania and throughout the United States — is an attempt to unravel and explain that ""tangled mass"", to establish cause and effect in its connected tissues, and to assign responsibility, credit, and sometimes blame for our common past and uncertain futures.
As a history teacher, I was startled to learn what happened in Minnesota this past academic year. The state-wide K-12 social studies curriculum was to be revamped. A subcommittee of right-wing activists decided not to teach middle school students about the
2
economics of slavery because knowing that human beings were bought and sold might ""prejudice the students against a free market economy!""2
The subcommittee's recommendations and others like it were derailed only after a protracted campaign.
Through the study and appreciation of our history, we hope to untangle and explain the past. We can do so both by revisiting familiar places and by looking into new ones, by trying to discover the hidden messages in secret, coded writing, messages behind the web which will tell us who we are.
We cannot do so by creating new secret, coded writing.
In my few minutes, I want to ruminate on and examine some fibers, some perhaps coincidental connections and hidden concerns in this nebulous network and suggest ways that teachers, historians and other scholars might follow them to illuminate the past and inform the present. What follows will be a scattered survey of some topics for future exploration, some old and some new, some moments in the membrane that connects us all.
My web will stretch from the campus of Lincoln University to Philadelphia, from Pennsylvania to Alabama, from the classroom to the courtroom, from African to African-American, from protest to politics, and from rhythm and blues to rock and roll.
If the modern movement for civil rights traces its beginning to the 1954 Supreme Court decision integrating public schools, that decision has some of its roots on the campus of Lincoln University chartered 100 years before.
3
Surely something at Lincoln helped to shape young Thurgood Marshall's mind and character toward his eventual life's work. College student Marshall could not have known that another Lincoln man, my father, would conduct some of the research underpinning Marshall's successful assault on separate and unequal education. And neither Marshall nor my father could have known that one of Marshall's classmates, Benjamin Nnamdi Azikwe, would become the first Prime Minister of Africa's largest nation, Nigeria, or that Azikiwe would urge the man who became the first Prime Minister of independent Ghana, Kwame Nkrumah, to seek his education at this same small rural college, founded in 1954, ""the first institution founded anywhere in the world to provide a higher education in the arts and sciences for 'youth of African descent.'""3
No one in the Lincoln class of 1930 with Marshall and Azikwe could have predicted or imagined that the rush for freedom in Africa would complement and encourage the rush toward freedom here, that events and personalities overseas would dictate and influence events and personalities here.
But surely something in the classroom and on the campus refined each man's conviction that his education there was for the cause of freedom. [A handwritten X appears in the right margin, pointing out the revision in the previous sentence.] What association, if any, did they have? What after-hour discussions, what campus event, what outside force helped to concentrate the African-American from Baltimore and the African from Nigeria toward their destinies? For students of gender politics, did Lincoln's single-sex education, yesterday's rule rather than today's exception, provide some extra stimulus to the sons of the Orange and Blue?
The roots of this tangled web go even deeper.
Lincoln's founder ""was John Miller Dickey, born in 1806; Thomas Jefferson was (then) President of the United States. ...""4

Thirty years earlier, Jefferson had written and signed the Declaration of Independence in Philadelphia. Thirteen years before Dickey was born, his eventual father-in-law, John Miller, had worked with another signer of the Declaration, Dr. Samuel Rush, to save Philadelphia in the frightful yellow fever epidemic of 1793. Two of Miller's helpers were black — Richard Allen, a year later the founder of the African Methodist Episcopal Church, and Absalom Jones, consecrated as the first black Episcopal priest in America.
So more than 160 years before a Lincoln man made segregation illegal, and nearly 170 years before a nonviolent army rose in the American South to challenge its morality, blacks and whites worked together in Pennsylvania in common cause.
We see Allen's and Jones' work everywhere in our past and present. We live today in a world struggling to live up to Jefferson's words, to the promises he and Dr. Rush signed in Philadelphia so long ago. What are we to make of this conjunction between one of America's founding fathers and the founders of black America's tradition of socially involved religions?
That nonviolent Southern movement's most prominent leader was Martin Luther King Jr., who received his early theological education a few miles from here at Chester's Crozier Theological Seminary. He found friends nearby — the Rev. J. Pius Barbour, pastor of Chester's Calvary Baptist Church and the Rev. William H. Gray, Jr. of Philadelphia's Bright Hope Baptist Church. He wrote his mother that he had met ""a fine chick"" in Philadelphia and dated an Atlanta schoolmate then studying at Temple. He told his mother she had ""gone wild over the old boy."" But he also found the North provided no escape from racism — with a classmate and two women friends, he was denied service at a tavern in Woodbridge, New Jersey.5

With a Bachelor of Divinity degree from Crozier, King began to work toward a PhD. from Boston University. With that work nearly completed, he answered a call from a church in Montgomery, Alabama over Christmas vacation in 1953. While King was deciding between Dexter Avenue Baptist Church and other offers he'd received, another young minister — like King, a rising star in his denomination — accepted a job in Pennsylvania as acting minister of his church. His name was Malcolm X. Malcom Little had been converted to Islam while a prisoner in a jail a few miles away from King's classrooms at Boston University. In March, 1954, he took over the Philadelphia Temple of the Nation of Islam.
King accepted the job in Montgomery in April; two weeks later in far-away place most Americans had never heard of — Dien Bien Phu — the forces of French colonialism were overthrown. Two weeks after the French fell in Indochina, Thurgood Marshall, Lincoln class of 1930, won his biggest legal victory — state sanctioned segregation fell here at home. The United States Supreme Court, in Brown vs. Board of Education, ruled that segregated schools were against the law.
As we commemorate the 50th anniversary of that landmark decision, it is easy to cast a cynical eye on the status of school desegregation in America today — or the sorry state of race relations — and minimize the significance of Brown. That is a grave mistake, for Brown — by destroying segregation's legality, gave a nonviolent army the power to destroy segregation's morality as well.
Thus it is no coincidence that this year we also celebrate the 40th anniversary of the passage of the 1964 Civil Rights Act — the most sweeping civil rights legislation before or since, and our democracy's finest hour. You are also celebrating your 40th anniversary this year.
So 2004, as we have commemorated these anniversaries, has been a time to examine our present in relation to our past. And, as we prepared for and engaged in national elections, 2004 has
6
been a time for an examination of our present in relation to our future.
As we analyze this year's election results, one lesson is the extent to which the body politic continues to feed off race.
Karl Rove may have predicted this year's outcome, but so did Lyndon Johnson. When he signed the Civil Rights act of 1964, Johnson told his aide Bill Moyers, ""I think we delivered the South to the Republican Party for your lifetime and mine.""6 [This speech mixes footnotes and end notes, with this reference repeating the reference of ""1"" and placing the full citation at the end of the speech. For clarity, the editors have standardized all citations, re-numbering for clarity. This reference is the sixth in the speech.]
That year, despite his national landslide, Johnson lost five Southern states, including four that the Democrats had not lost in 84 years. Now the Republicanization of the former slave states is complete. This year George W. Bush won the South by five million votes, meaning that he lost the rest of the country by a million-and-a-half votes.
Five Senate seats in the old Confederacy went from Democratic to Republican, increasing the GOP's total to 18 of the region's 22 seats.
Bush's base of white evangelicals continues in the tradition of those who ""have cut off their economic noses to spite black faces since the end of the Civil War.""7
As the song says, ""Yesterday's just a memory, tomorrow's not what it's supposed to be."" As this election proves, history never ends.
We look back on the years between Brown and the passage of the 1964 Civil Rights Act with some pride.
Martin Luther King's first national address was at a 1957 Prayer Pilgrimage on the third anniversary of Brown at the Lincoln Memorial.
In 1963 alone, the year that King — fresh from the battlefields of Birmingham — told the nation of his dream at the March on Washington, there were more than 10,000 anti-racist demonstrations.
King was the most famous and well known of the modern movement's personalities, but it was a people's movement. It
7
produced leaders of its own; but it relied not on the noted but the nameless, not on the famous but the faceless. It didn't wait for commands from afar to begin a campaign against injustice. It saw wrong and acted against it; it saw evil and brought it down.
Those were the days when women and men of all races and creeds worked together in the cause of civil rights.
Those were the days when good music was popular and popular music was good. Those were the days when the President picked the Supreme Court and not the other way around.
Those were the days when we had a war on poverty, not a war on the poor. Those were the days when patriotism was a reason for open-eyed disobedience, not an excuse for blind allegiance.
Those were the days when the news media really was ""fair and balanced"" and not just stenographers for the powerful.
But those were not ""the good old days.""
In those days, ""(t)he law, the courts, the schools, and almost every institution ... favored whites. This was white supremacy.""8
Martin Luther King described it in 1962. He said then:
""When you have seen vicious mobs lynch your mothers and fathers at will and drown your sisters and brothers at whim; when you have seen hate-filled policemen curse, kick and even kill your black brothers and sisters; when you see the vast majority of your twenty million Negro brothers smothering in an airtight cage of poverty in the midst of an affluent society; when you suddenly find your tongue twisted and your speech stammering as you seek to explain to your six-year-old daughter why she can't go to the public amusement park that has just been advertised on television, and see tears welling up in her eyes when she is told that Funtown is closed to colored children, and see ominous clouds of inferiority beginning to form in her little mental sky, and see her beginning to distort her personality by developing an unconscious bitterness toward white people; when you have to concoct an answer for a five-year-old son who is asking: ""Daddy, why do white people treat colored people so mean?"" ... when you are harried by day and haunted by night by the fact that you are a Negro, living constantly on tip-toe stance, never quite knowing what to expect next, and
8
are plagued with inner fears and outer resentments; when you are forever fighting a degenerating sense of 'nobodiness' — then,"" King concluded, ""you will understand.""
You would understand that most southern Blacks could not vote. They attended inadequate, segregated schools, if they went at all, and many attended only a few months each year. Most could not hope to gain an education beyond high school. Most worked as farmers, or semi-skilled laborers. Few owned the land they farmed, or even the homes in which they lived.
The Court's action in Brown and the end of French colonial domination of Vietnam set free forces that would change the face of the United States as they are changing it still. The United States had argued in 1954 that continued school segregation at home weakened American diplomacy overseas. In Cold War competition in the Third World, America's racial climate was a potent weapon. The Supreme Court decision in 1954 provided the United States with a propaganda victory it could trumpet around the world, but when Americans replaced the French as preservers of Western interests in Vietnam, they began to lose whatever advantage they had won. The tangled web drew tighter.
Black youngsters in the middle 1950s, not immediately affected by the Supreme Court or the French defeat, got an early warning about how deadly racism really was. Fourteen-year-old Emmett Till was kidnapped, castrated and lynched for speaking to a white woman in Mississippi. Jet magazine showed us his water swollen corpse. I was one year older and thought — this could happen to me.
A year after King arrived in Montgomery, and ninety-five days after Emmett Till was lynched, Rosa Parks was arrested for refusing to give up her seat on a city bus. Within days, young Martin Luther King found himself quoting slaveholder Thomas Jefferson to justify a city-wide bus boycott by the children and grandchildren of slaves, an exercise in community-wide self-help that would last for more than a year. He also found a life-long friend — Bayard Rustin
9
from West Chester, Pennsylvania — who gave King instruction in nonviolence, wrote his speeches, and planned the organization of the civil rights group King would head until he was killed 14 years later.
While King organized the boycott in Montgomery, Malcolm X organized Muslim Temples in Pittsburgh and King's home town, Atlanta. He had been paroled from prison in August, 1952, as King began his full-time ministry at Dexter Avenue Baptist Church. James Cone9 has written eloquently of these two representatives of the broad streams of black American thought, of the nightmare and the dream, of the ways in which they complement each other.
Malcolm X was a frequent critic of Martin Luther King, most harshly for his use of children in the Birmingham protests in 1963. King answered that criticism, and asked where Malcolm X was while segregation crushed those children's lives — presumably he was selling wolf tickets on the corner of 125th Street and Lenox Avenue.
In 1956, Rustin and King met with a Washington lawyer with deep roots in Alabama, Harris Wofford, who had been the first white student at Howard University Law School since suffragettes had attended Thurgood Marshall's graduate alma mater in the 1910s. Wofford and Rustin helped arrange for Martin and Coretta King to visit India, but their first overseas trip was to Africa in March, 1957 to attend the inauguration of Kwame Nkrumah, Lincoln class of 1939, as Prime Minister of Ghana.
Wofford, of course, became President of Bryn Mawr and, later, United States Senator from Pennsylvania.
It was in Ghana that King met Vice President Richard M. Nixon.
Three years later in 1960, Nixon had a right to expect his campaign for President would receive the lion's share of black
10
votes. Sixty percent of black voters had chosen the Republican in 1956. John Kennedy was black America's least favored Democratic option in 1960; he had little civil rights record, while Nixon did.
But when King was arrested a few days before Election Day and sent to a dangerous state prison in Georgia, the election arithmetic began to change. Both candidates were asked for their response, and Nixon had none. John and Robert Kennedy, on the other hand, expressed their concern in telephone calls to Mrs. King and the sentencing judge. Harris Wofford made sure black America knew the difference.
With Kennedy campaign staff member Louis Martin, Wofford set up a dummy campaign committee headquartered in Philadelphia whose co-chairman were the Rev. Marshall L. Shepherd and the aforementioned Rev. William H Gray. They distributed thousands of copies of a blue leaflet that compared ""No Comment Nixon"" to the their ""candidate with a heart, Senator Kennedy."" [Two handwritten X marks appear in the right margin, pointing out the revisions in the previous paragraph.]
By Election Day, a massive shift had occurred in black America. The 60% of black votes the Republicans won in 1956 shrunk to 30% in 1960. The black votes for Kennedy were his margin of victory in key states — including Pennsylvania — and they gave the election to the ""candidate with a heart.""
Oddly, nearly every analysis one reads — both historical and present-day — of black voting behavior since 1960 — indeed, since 1936 — emphasizes the overwhelming Democratic nature of the black electorate. A truer description of the choices blacks make on Election Day — especially since the 1980s, — might be ""anti-Republican"" rather than ""pro-Democratic"". Wouldn't a proper analysis suggest that rather than preferring one party, black voters are rejecting the other? The difference is important.
We meet on the heels of a Presidential election which, among other things, gives credence to the old adage, ""the more things change, the more they remain the same.""
In the face of momentous events and changes in our national lives since 2000, voting patterns and results were remarkably
11
unchanged from that election to this one. With the exception of three states whose razor-thin margins reversed (New Mexico, New Hampshire, and Iowa), the electoral map in 2004 was identical to the electoral map in 2000.
More people voted against George W. Bush than any Presidential candidate in American history, giving him ""the narrowest win for a sitting president since Woodrow Wilson in 1916.""10
Both sides mobilized their supporters, but Republicans did it better — fostering division with precision.
Just as ""weapons of mass destruction"" morphed into ""weapons of mass destruction program related activities, "" yesterday's ""family values"" morphed into ""moral values"" — because there are some families they don't like.
""Moral values"" trumped terrorism, war, the economy and jobs for 20% of voters, 80% of whom supported George W. Bush. A shift of 70,000 votes in Ohio would have cost Bush the Presidency. But Ohio, the state that suffered the greatest job loss in the nation, went to Bush, thanks to a same-sex marriage amendment on the ballot.
Vote totals show an America divided: men versus women, whites versus non-whites, married versus unmarried, straight versus gay, old versus young, conservatives versus liberals, Protestants versus Jews, rural Americans versus urbanites.
So we have a country divided roughly 50/50 but a government held entirely by one side. And each side believes the other leads down the road to perdition, giving new meaning to Woody Guthrie's famous refrain — ""this land is your land, this land is my land.""
If you think that racial discrimination and white supremacy no longer reign in America, consider this. While America was deciding who would be President, Alabama voters also had an amendment on their ballots which would have eliminated segregationist language from their state's constitution. It was
12
defeated. This is the same state in which forty percent of voters, more than half-a-million people, voted against interracial marriage in 2002. This is also the same state that this year elected to its Supreme Court a man who drew his support from the pro-secession and pro-Confederacy Alabama League of the South — and who handed out small Confederate flags. Of course, the League of the South is not confined to Alabama — and neither are Confederate flags and the sentiments — and the values — of the hands that hold them.
While the election's losers — rightly — will be encouraged to examine their mistakes, the winners ought to ponder their failure to penetrate the black political consensus.
The passage of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and the Voting Rights Act of 1965 marked the beginning of the dependence of one of our political parties on the politics of racial division to win elections and gain power. By playing the race card in election after election, they've appealed to the dark underside of American culture, to the minority of Americans who reject democracy and equality.
They preach racial neutrality and practice racial division. They celebrate Martin Luther King and misuse his message.
Their idea of reparations is to give war criminal Jefferson Davis a pardon.
They believe eliminating teacher's, policemen's and firemen's jobs reduces unemployment.
Their idea of a pristine environment is a parking lot before the lines are painted in.
Their idea of equal rights is the American and Confederate flags flying side by side.
Their idea of compassion is to ask the guests at the millionaires' banquet if they want an extra helping and a second dessert.
They've tried to patch the leaky economy — and every other
13
domestic problem — with duct tape and plastic sheets.
They write a new Constitution for Iraq and try to re-write the Constitution here at home.
They draw their most rabid supporters from the Taliban wing of American politics.
Now they want write bigotry back into the Constitution; they want to make one group of Americans outsiders to our common heritage. They want to do what has never been done before — to amend the Constitution to create a group of second-class citizens. The Constitution is the last hope of freedom; it cannot become a carrier of prejudice and intolerance.
And what about the opposition party? Too often they're not an opposition; they're an amen corner. While one party has been whistling Dixie, the other has been whistling in the dark.
With some notable exceptions, they have been absent without leave from this battle for America's soul.
When one party is shameless, the other party cannot afford to be spineless.
If one party runs on values, the other party cannot run on policy alone. Tolerance is a value. Respect for difference is a value. Stewardship of the air and water is a value. Concern for the poor and disadvantaged is a value. Inclusion is a value.
I believe in an integrated America — jobs, homes, and schools. I believe in it enough to have spent most of my life in its elusive pursuit. I think it is a legal, moral and political imperative for America — a matter of elemental justice, simple right waged against historical wrong.
I not only have spent most of my life in the cause of integration, in 1947 — when I was seven years old — I was a plaintiff in a lawsuit in rural Pennsylvania against segregated schools.
It never came to trial. The school board had segregated schools by giving students achievement tests which all blacks failed and all whites passed, but when the two dumb sons of the
14
local white political boss failed the test, they closed the black school, and all of Lincoln University Village's children went to a one-room school together.
Last year I visited Berea College in Kentucky, opened by abolitionists as an integrated school in 1855. It was closed by the Civil War, but opened again in 1866 with 187 students — 96 blacks and 91 whites. It dared to provide a rare commodity in the former slave states — an education open to all — blacks and whites, women and men.
One of those early students was my grandfather, James Bond.
Like many others, I am the grandson of a slave. My grandfather was born in 1863, in Kentucky; freedom didn't come for him until the 13th Amendment was ratified in 1865.
He and his mother were property, like a horse or a chair. As a young girl, she had been given away as a wedding present to a new bride, and when that bride became pregnant, her husband — that's my great-grandmother's owner and master — exercised his right to take his wife's slave as his mistress.
That union produced two children, one of them my grandfather.
At age 15, barely able to read and write, he hitched his tuition — a steer — to a rope and walked across Kentucky to Berea College and the college took him in.
My grandfather belonged to a transcendent generation of black Americans, a generation born into slavery, freed by the Civil War, determined to make their way as free women and men. From Berea, he studied for the ministry, married, and had six children — one of them my father, Horace Mann Bond.
My father graduated from Pennsylvania's Lincoln University and earned a doctorate in education from the University of Chicago. For him, too, education was a means to a larger end — the uplift of his people and the salvation of his race.
How fitting, then, that he would be asked to help the NAACP in its legal campaign against school segregation — the campaign
15
that culminated in Brown v. Board of Education.
There can be no mistake — those fifty years since Brown have seen the fortunes of black America advance and retreat, but the decision is always cause for sober celebration, not impotent dismay.
We celebrate the brilliant legal minds who were the architects of Brown v. Board; we celebrate the brave families who were its plaintiffs; and we celebrate the legal principle that remains its enduring legacy — that, in the words of Chief Justice Earl Warren, ""the doctrine of separate but equal has no place.""11
That the quest for meaningful equality — political and economic equity — remains unfulfilled today is no indictment of past efforts. It is testament to our challenge.
When my grandfather graduated from Berea, in 1892, the college asked him to deliver the commencement address.
He said then:
""The pessimist from his corner looks out on the world of wickedness and sin, and blinded by all that is good or hopeful in the condition and progress of the human race, bewails the present state of affairs and predicts woeful things for the future.""
""In every cloud he beholds a destructive storm, in every flash of lightning an omen of evil, and in every shadow that falls across his path a lurking foe.""
""He forgets that the clouds also bring life and hope, that lightning purifies the atmosphere, that shadow and darkness prepare for sunshine and growth, and that hardships and adversity nerve the race, as the individual, for greater efforts and grander victories.""12

'Greater efforts and grander victories.' That was the promise made by the generation born in slavery more than 140 years ago. That was the promise made by the generation that won the great world war for democracy almost six decades ago. That was the promise made by those who brought democracy to America's darkest corners four decades ago, and that is the promise we must all seek to honor today.

When I was growing up in rural Pennsylvania, the new medium of television was quickly shrinking our world. When the first family in our small community bought a set, we eagerly solicited and accepted their invitation to visit on Saturday or Sunday evenings to see the Colgate Palmolive Comedy Hour or the Ed Sullivan Show.
And if black performers were scheduled to appear — the Will Mastin Trio, featuring Sammy Davis Jr., ; Nat 'King' Cole; Eartha Kitt — the word went out on the grapevine and we gathered eagerly to see black faces appear in black and white. [A handwritten X mark appears in the right margin, pointing out the revision in the previous paragraph.]
By 1954, 29 million U.S. homes had television sets; my home was one of them. There were only a few teenagers living on Lincoln's campus. If I wanted to dance with a girl who wasn't my sister, I had to go to Philadelphia. But there was a magical television show from Philadelphia, hosted by a man named Bob Horn, that catered just to teenagers like me. It was called Bandstand, and it featured teenagers from South Philadelphia, most of them Italian American, dancing to the top hits of the day. A young disc jockey name Dick Clark replaced Bob Horn in 1956; in August, 1957, the show became American Bandstand and was broadcast nationally on ABC-TV. Occasionally — very, very rarely — a black couple would appear.
But black music always did. We heard Fats Domino's ""Ain't That A Shame"", Church Berry's ""Maybelline"", Little Richard's ""Tutti Frutti."" We saw Billy Williams, Lee Andrews and the Hearts, the Rays, Jackie Wilson, Johnnie Mathis, the 5 Satins, Chuck Berry and Sam Cooke.13
But our attention was drawn to the dancers, Arlene Sullivan and Ken Rossi and Justine Corelli and Bob Clayton. For a teenager riding a rural bus route to a one-room school with an outhouse, these young people represented everything that was big city,
17
sophisticated, hip, cool, and correct!
We imitated their dance steps, their clothes, their walk. And we recognized in the music a message of racial and generational change that white young people felt too. Todd Gitlin remembers: ""Even packaged for mass consumption, American Bandstand rolled over Beethoven and insisted rock and roll was here to stay, out in the suburbs and small towns where flesh and blood blacks did not tread.""14
But in September, 1957, another set of teenagers seized my attention, and the hearts and minds of millions of other young black teenagers.
They were the Little Rock Nine — Ernie Greene, Minnie Jean Brown, Elizabeth Eckford and six other brave youngsters who faced angry mobs daily to integrate Little Rock's Central High School.
With these youngsters, it wasn't flashy clothes — pegged pants and poodle skirts, rat killer shoes and Capezios — or fancy haircuts — DAs or Duck Tails on the boys and flips and bubbles on the girls — that drew our attention.
It was raw courage, bravery and self-assurance. Within weeks, through television and the black press, we soon knew everything about them.
Ernie Greene was the oldest; he graduated from Central High in 1958. He was the most mature of the group. Minnie Jean Brown was the baddest — when white students hit her, she hit back. She overturned a bowl of chili on a white boy's head. When a girl called her a name, she answered back: ""White trash!"" We agonized with Minnie Jean, glad she was bold enough to never take anything, frightened that her boldness would get her expelled. In the end, it did, and she finished school in New York.
But it was Elizabeth Eckford who made the greatest impression on me. On the first day they were to attend Central High, Elizabeth
18
missed the telephone call that arranged a before-school meeting. She arrived to face a mob of screaming harridans all alone. Those of you who have seen ""Eyes on the Prize"" have seen Elizabeth Eckford. She's wearing a shirt-waist dress, carrying her school books cradled in her arms. She has on dark glasses. She's walking slowly through the crowd while they scream at her. Their faces are literally contorted with hate and rage. Her face shows no emotion and the dark glasses hide her eyes. A middle-age white woman steps from the crowd and puts her arm around Elizabeth's shoulder, and takes her to a bus stop bench.
I saw Elizabeth's mother later on the television set in my home. She said that when Elizabeth came home from school that day her dress was so wet with spit she could wring it out.
So wet with spit she could wring it out!
How many times, I wondered, would how many people have to spit how much to achieve that result? If this little girl — she was two years younger than I — can withstand that, I thought, surely there is something I can do.
Elizabeth Eckford and Ernie Greene and Minnie Jean Brown became my new heroes. The boys and girls of American Bandstand faded away.
The Little Rock Nine set a new standard of behavior for my generation; black young people would never be the same.
The generation of black college students who made the 1960s student civil rights movement have as their common point of reference Emmett Till and the Little Rock Nine. In interview after interview, they recall his death and their bravery as motivator for their actions in the years that followed. The 1960 sit-in leaders are the cousins of Emmett Till and the Little Rock Nine.
Few scholars have made the connection between the cultural revolution that was occurring in the late 1950s among all American young people — a revolution whose cutting edge was black music, the infusion of musical fat back and greens into white bread and mayonnaise, the introduction of excitement, sensuality and soul
19
into sterile living rooms — and the political revolution that followed.
In 1957, Norman Mailer wrote an essay called ""The White Negro"",15 describing a white ""philosophical psychopath"" revolt against mainstream America, whose chief inspiration, he said was the jazz music and uninhibited sensuality of black Americans. [A handwritten X mark appears in the right margin, pointing out the revision in the previous paragraph.]
But the real ""white Negro"" then was the young Elvis Presley; his inspiration wasn't Charlie Parker or Miles Davis, but Big Boy Crudup and Big Mama Thornton. He listened ""constantly""16 to radio station WDIA, the South's first black audience radio station. He plastered Royal Crown Pomade in his hair; he bought his clothes on Memphis' Beal Street at Lansky's where the local black players bought their threads. His ""gabardine slacks with hot pink or lime green inlets to match his equally iridescent jackets and slacks, plus Mr. B. low collared shirts ... with the collar turned up"" made him a markedly different figure from his white Memphis schoolmates. He wore the clothes or uniform of black outlaws, imagining, perhaps, that he was an outlaw too. [A handwritten X mark appears in the right margin, pointing out the revision in the previous paragraph.]
Conversely, the black performer able to speak most effectively to white teenagers was Chuck Berry, whose songs told tales about the urban, post-war teenage experience, about cars and school and romance. With ""Maybelline"" and ""Rock & Roll Music"" in 1957 and ""Sweet Little Sixteen"" and ""Johnny B. Goode"" in 1958, Berry was the first black rock and roll guitar hero; he defined black music for white America, so much so that when young Bruce Springsteen's band was appearing as back-up for Berry in New Jersey and asked him what they should play, he replied ""Just play some Chuck Berry music!""
Berry and many more on the black side and Presley and many more on the white side and American Bandstand as conduit made teenagers in the late 1950s believe they belonged to a subculture based on their youth and their allegiance to the music of
20
rebellion, the homogenized music of black America, rhythm and blues. Presley and Berry sounded the call to arms; Bandstand was ""the daily meeting of their (peer) group.""17
Scratch a white participant in the '60s student rebellions and you will likely find a Chuck Berry and Elvis Presley fan, someone who knows ""Roll Over, Beethoven"" and ""Teddy Bear."" Culture can be a location — not a substitute — for struggles for power. It is ""a form of politics, as a means of reshaping individual and collective practice for specified interests, and as long as individuals perceive their interests as unfilled, culture retains an oppositional potential.""18
What do history's dry bones have to tell us about our present discontents?
Much of today's discussion of inequality focuses on race, rather than racism. Although we all often use these words interchangeably, they are not the same and they do not mean the same thing. Particularly now, as the nation and those who want to lead the nation try to assign blame and causation, the difference becomes more important. They speak about race; racism is the culprit.
Following the urban violence of the middle '60s, the Kerner Commission appointed by President Lyndon Johnson concluded that ""white racism"" was the single most important cause of inequality in income, housing, employment, education and life chances between blacks and whites.
But by the middle 1970s, the growing number of blacks and other minorities, pressing for entry into traditionally white institutions, created a backlash in the discourse about race. Opinion leaders — in government and private life — began to
21
redefine the terms of the discussion. No longer was the Kerner Commission's formulation acceptable. Any indictment of white America could be abandoned. Instead, black behavior became the reason why blacks and whites lived in separate worlds. In a kind of nonsensical tautology, the message became — these people are poor because they are pathological, they are pathological because they are poor.
In 1896, W.E.B. DuBois and his new bride moved into the slums of Philadelphia's Seventh Ward, living as he wrote, amidst ""dirt, drunkenness, poverty and crime. Murder sat on our doorstep, police were our government, and philanthropy dropped in with periodic advice.""19
DuBois did not hesitate to criticize much of what he found. Crime in the Seventh Ward was ""the besetting sin of half-developed races."" The black Philadelphians he studied were ""a people comparatively low on in the scale of civilization"". Black prisoners in the Philadelphia jail, he wrote, were criminal ""by natural and inherent depravity.""20
But DuBois did not assign these faults to biology, as was common then, or to failed culture, as is common now.
Instead he blamed the disruptive force of slavery and current white prejudice. He called for the kind of black self-help and trained leadership which flowered into the Niagara Movement in 1905 and the NAACP four years later. And he helped to set in motion a remarkable century of community development, agitation, and organization against greater odds than any we face today. We are — I am — heir to the work he and others began before the 20th Century was born.
22
The successful strategies of the modern movement for civil rights were litigation, organization, mobilization and coalition, all aimed at creating a national constituency for civil rights.
Sometimes the simplest of ordinary, everyday acts — sitting at a lunch counter, going to a new school, applying for a marriage license — can have unforeseen results.
It can change the universe, it can challenge the way we think and act.
The movement marched and picketed and protested against state-sanctioned segregation, and brought that system crashing to its knees.
Today's times require no less, and in fact insist on more.
Now as we find ourselves re-fighting old battles we thought already won and facing new problems we have barely begun to acknowledge, we ought to take heart. If there is more to be done, we have more to do it with, much more than those who came before us and who brought us along this far.
As a nation, we have a history of aggressive self-help and voluntarism, in church and civic club and neighborhood association, providing scholarships, helping the needy, promoting social service.
But volunteering for social service alone does little to change the status quo. Creating change requires challenging power.
It is never enough just to ignore evil. It is never enough just to do good. It is never enough just to feed the hungry and house the homeless, as commendable as these deeds are.
It may be helpful to think about our task in this way:
Two men are sitting by a river and see, to their great surprise, a helpless baby floating by. They rescue the child, and to their horror, another baby soon comes floating down the stream. When that child is pulled to safety, another baby comes
23
along. As one man plunges into the river a third time, the other rushes upstream.
""Come back!"" yells the man in the water. ""We must save this baby!""
""You save it,"" the other yells back. ""I'm going to find out who is throwing babies in the river and I'm going to make them stop!""
I recently heard Professor Lani Guinier say that minorities are like the canaries that miners used to carry to warn them when the underground air was becoming too toxic to breathe.
But too many people want to put gas masks on the canaries instead of eliminating the poison in the air. Too many want to put life preservers on the babies, instead of stopping them from being thrown into a treacherous, dangerous flood.
We have a long and honorable tradition of social justice in this country. It still sends forth the message that when we act together we can overcome.
And we have a revitalized NAACP prepared for the challenges that lie ahead.21
We have no permanent friends, and no permanent enemies, just permanent interests, and those interests are justice and freedom.
It is a serious mistake — both tactical and moral — to believe this is a fight that must be waged by black Americans alone. That has never been so in centuries past; it ought no to be so in the century unfolding now.
Black, yellow, red and white — all are needed in this fight.
All of us are implicated in the continuation of inequality — it will require our common effort to bring it to an end.
The 2004 election doesn't change the task before us. If it makes it more difficult, it also makes it more imperative.
A progressive agenda for this new century must include continuing to litigate, to organize, to mobilize, forming coalitions of the caring and concerned, joining ranks against the comfortable, the callous and the smug.
24
We must fight discrimination, wherever it raises its ugly head — in the halls of government, in corporate suites or in the streets.
We must demand fair treatment for people with HIV/AIDS, especially for people of color. This disease strikes African-American women more than any other group. It doesn't happen to ""others"" — it happens to all of us.
We must demand that ""criminal justice"" cease being an oxymoron. We know race, more than any other factor, determines who is arrested, who is tried and for what crime, who receives what length of sentence, and who receives the ultimate punishment — and we are determined that it stop.
We must insure that our children — in inner city and suburban and rural schools — receive the best education, an education that prepares them for the century just begun. [A handwritten X mark appears in the right margin, pointing out the revision in the previous paragraph.]
We must provide health care, protect Social Security, and promote peace.
There is much more — none of it easy work, but we have never wished our way to freedom. Instead, we have always worked our way.
By the year 2050, blacks and Hispanics together will be 40% of the nation's population.
Wherever there are others who share our condition or concerns, we must make common cause with them. In the NAACP, we believe colored people come in all colors — anyone who shares our values is more than welcome.
The growth in immigration and the emergence of new and vibrant populations of people of color hold great promise and great peril. The promise is that the coalition for justice has grown larger and stronger, as new allies join the fight.
The peril comes from real fears that our common foes will find ways to separate and divide us. It doesn't make sense if blacks and Latinos fight over which group has less power; together we can constitute a mighty force for right.
25
Racial justice, economic equality, and world peace — these were the themes that occupied King's life; they ought to occupy ours today.
We live in a small world. If we could shrink the earth's population to a village of 100 people, with existing ratios remaining the same, the world would look like this:

there would be 57 Asians, 21 Europeans, 14 from the Western Hemisphere, both north and south, and 8 Africans.
52 of the 100 would be female. 70 would be nonwhite. 70 would not be Christians.
6 of the 100 people would own 59% of all the wealth in the world and all six of these would be from the United States.
80 of the 100 would live in substandard housing. 70 would be unable to read and write. 50 would suffer from malnutrition.
Only 1 would own a computer. Only 1 would have a college education.

Looking at the world in this way, we are reminded of our mutual dependence and mutual responsibilities.22
We know our world and our lives changed on September 11th. We don't know how much even yet. But we know we have a job to do at home as much as abroad.
When I started working four decades ago, there were five workers paying into the national retirement system for every retiree.
I can't possibly know who my five were, but their names could easily have been Carl, Ralph, Bob, Steve and Bill.
When I retire, there will only be three workers paying into the retirement system — their names could easily be Tamika, Maria, and Jose.
We need to provide them with the best schools, the best health care, the best jobs, and the strongest protections against discrimination we possibly can.

In 1965, President Lyndon Baines Johnson spoke to Congress about new civil rights protections he was proposing. He said then:
""... the harsh fact is that in many places in this country men and women are kept from voting simply because they are Negroes.""

Then Johnson situated the problem in entrenched white supremacy.
""For the fact is the only way to pass these barriers is to have a white skin.""
""Experience has clearly shown that the existing processes of law cannot overcome systematic and ingenious discrimination.""1

A week before the President's speech, Alabama State Troopers and members of a sheriff's posse had beaten peaceful demonstrators at Selma's Edmund Pettus Bridge.
The national outrage at bloody Sunday met Johnson's months-old plans to insure black Southerners could vote. Within a few months, the 1965 Voting Rights Act (the Act)2 became law. It is generally agreed to be the ""most effective civil rights legislation ever passed.""3
Before the Act became law, Blacks in the Southern states were victims of a century-old system of legally sanctioned white supremacy, enforced by private and state terror, including ritual human sacrifice. In all but a few instances, Blacks were excluded from voting and had no influence in the conduct of public affairs.
It was not until 1870, with the ratification of the 15th Amendment, that black men were granted the right to vote in the United States, a privilege granted to black and
2
other women 50 years later.
But in 1965, when the Voting Rights Act was passed, only 31% of all black people of voting age were registered to vote in the seven states covered initially by the new law — Virginia, North and South Carolina, Georgia, Alabama, Mississippi and Texas.
At its heart, the Act banned literacy tests and poll taxes. But its radical nature consisted of the fact that it removed the voting process from local control. Section 5 required pre-clearance of changes in voting laws from the United States Attorney General or a federal court in Washington, DC. A prime test of the Act insisted there be no retrogression of minority strength in covered political units.
This federalizing of the process led to the Act being drafted as a temporary measure due to expire in five years.
When it was renewed in 1970, despite opposition by the Nixon Administration, it outlawed literacy tests nationwide. Both the 1970 and 1975 extensions offered new protections for voters whose first language was not English.
In 1982 the Act was strengthened further and extended for 25 years — to 2007. The 1982 amendments were the result of Congressional acknowledgement of a hard truth — the simple ability to cast a vote did not provide the newly enfranchised blacks with a realistic opportunity to elect candidates of their choices.
Today how — and whether — Congress will re-authorize key provisions of the Act and will correct sections of the Act weakened by hostile court decisions is already becoming a focus of both the enemies and the advocates of civil rights.
But first, some history based on my own experiences with this all-important legislation. What follows is an account of my experiences with voting rights legislation and the Voting Rights Act, as beneficiary of the Act's provisions and as intervenor and plaintiff — as one of many who have used the Act to advance civil rights for all. I hope my story reinforces the need to guard against the resurgence of white supremacy at the ballot box.
From 1960 until the fall of 1965, I worked for the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee (SNCC)4.
In Selma, as elsewhere, SNCC workers helped to bolster the indigenous leadership and local organizations, like Selma's Dallas County Voters League. By 1965, SNCC's organizers had conducted dangerous voter drives across the Black Belt.
3
They had forced a reluctant United States Department of Justice to take its first tentative steps to protect voter registration workers and building on work done by generations before them, had hastened the political revolution that would soon sweep the South.5
I want first to discuss my own experiences with the larger struggle for the right to cast a ballot, and a connected and equally important right to have that ballot counted in a meaningful way. And I want to close with a discussion of current threats to voting rights and continuing challenges to minorities' right to vote at all.
The year following the passage of the Voting Rights Act, I was a plaintiff in a case which reached the United States Supreme Court and strongly reinforced the right to vote.
The case, Bond v. Floyd6 grew from my first election in 1965 to the Georgia House of Representatives, part of a group who comprised the first Blacks in the lower House since Reconstruction.
A series of federal lawsuits had reapportioned the Georgia General Assembly, overturning a system where cows and horses were better represented than human beings.
The court ordered new, equal districts created in urban Fulton County and ordered new elections for a one year term.7 As a successful candidate for one of those new seats, I was to take the oath of office on January 19, 1966.
4
Seven days before I was to take office, Samuel Younge, Jr., a Tuskegee Institute student and SNCC worker, was shot and killed while trying to use the segregated bathroom at a Tuskegee service station. Younge was a Navy veteran; the irony of losing the life he had offered his country over a segregated toilet prompted the release of an anti-war statement by SNCC's Executive Committee. On January 6, 1966, SNCC became the first national civil rights organization to link the prosecution of the Vietnam War with the persecution of Blacks at home.
The SNCC statement accused the United States of deception ""in its claims of concern for the freedom of colored peoples in such countries as the Dominican Republic, the Congo, South Africa, Rhodesia, and in the United States itself.""
""The United States is no respecter of persons or laws,"" the statement said, ""when such persons or laws run counter to its needs and desires.""
The statement created a sensation. In the civil rights community, it created a breech in the relationship between the most militant civil rights organizations and the administration of President Lyndon B. Johnson and further widened the gap between SNCC and the civil rights mainstream.
The reaction in the white South was even more severe, including harsh criticism from Southern white liberals, such as Ralph McGill and Lillian Smith, whose anti-communism competed with their commitment to equal rights for Blacks.
I was SNCC's Communications Director, and when I appeared to take the oath of office on January 10, 1966, hostility from white legislators was palpable and nearly absolute. They prevented me from taking the oath, declared my seat vacant, and ordered another election to fill the vacancy.
I won that election and was expelled again; by the time I approached a third election, this time for a two-year term, I had filed suit in federal court.
Federal Judge Griffin Bell wrote the majority decision for the three judge court which refused to overturn the Georgia Legislature's decision to deny me the seat I already had won twice.
His decision was overruled by a unanimous United States Supreme Court, and a year after my first election, I became a member of the Georgia House of Representatives.
I had never been to the Supreme Court; as I sat and listened to Georgia's Attorney General Arthur Bolton argue that Georgia had a right to refuse to seat me, I found myself hypnotically nodding in agreement. My lawyer, Victor Rabinowitz, elbowed
5
me and whispered, ""Stop that!""
During Bolton's argument, the Justices asked a few questions. When Justice Byron White said, ""Is that all you have? You've come all this way, and that's all you have?"" I knew we had won.
Chief Justice Earl Warren's decision in Bond v. Floyd was more than a victory for the First Amendment; it was a voting rights victory, a reaffirmation of my constituents' right to free choice in casting their votes.
I ran afoul of Judge Bell again in 1971. Once more the unfettered right to vote was at issue; once again, Judge Bell ruled against me.
In Bond v. Fortson8, Andrew Young and I challenged Georgia's run-off primary vote provision for members of Congress. Judge Bell granted summary judgment to the defendants on the ground that the issue was not ripe for review, since neither Young nor I knew if we would ever run for Congress. Eventually, we both did. [A handwritten X mark appears in the right margin, pointing out the revision to the previous paragraph.]
Finally, I was a party to a suit in 1981 in which the Voting Rights Act's protections were invoked to help create a majority Black congressional district in Georgia.
Busbee v. Smith9 stands as an important landmark in voting rights litigation.
In Busbee, a federal court found impermissible racial intent in a voting rights case, requiring creation of a majority Black district for the first time.
Busbee grew from my legislative attempts to create a majority Black congressional district in Georgia.
Georgia's 5th Congressional District, encompassing Fulton County and most of the city of Atlanta, was 50.33% Black according to the 1980 Census.
Andrew Young had been elected to the United States Congress from Georgia's 5th in what voting rights lawyer Laughlin McDonald called ""the bi-racial afterglow of the civil rights movement"" in 1972; he served there until he was appointed United States Ambassador to the United Nations by President Jimmy Carter in 1977.
The 5th District from which Young was elected was drawn only after the Attorney General of the United States had imposed a Section 5 objection to pre-clearance of the 1970 reapportionment plan drawn by the Georgia General Assembly.
That plan had fragmented concentrations of Black persons and had placed the residences of potential Black congressional candidates outside and the residences of
6
potential white candidates inside the 5th District. For example, the homes of Andrew Young and Maynard Jackson were placed outside the boundary of the 5th District.
In a special 1981 session of the Georgia General Assembly, called to consider reapportionment of legislative congressional districts, I made several attempts to introduce and pass a reapportionment plan which would create a majority Black congressional district.
My white colleagues in the Senate and House introduced a variety of plans — in each one of the plans submitted by white legislators, the 5th Congressional District followed the lines drawn in 1971. The Black population percentage in the 5th District remained between 51 and 52 percent.
On August 12, 1981, the House Reapportionment Committee adopted a plan which gave the 5th District a Black population of 51.73 %.
Five days later, I introduced in the Senate Reapportionment Committee a plan which would have created a 73.38% Black congressional district. I had waited until disputes involving eight of Georgia's ten Congressional districts were resolved. The eight — Districts 1 through 3 and 6 through 10 — surrounded Fulton and DeKalb Counties, creating a predominantly white doughnut around two heavily Black counties. The hole in the doughnut would be my playground and battlefield.
After the Bond Plan was introduced, the Chairman of the Senate Reapportionment Committee adjourned the meeting without seeking a vote. On the next day, the Committee adopted a Reapportionment Plan which included the Bond Plan. The Chairman cast the sole vote against the plan, in violation of Senate rules, under which he could vote only to break a tie. On the Senate floor, the Chairman of the Reapportionment Committee — at the urging of then Lt. Governor Zell Miller — introduced an amendment to the Committee plan. The Chairman's amendment accomplished two tasks: it split prosperous Gwinnett County between two districts so the county would not overshadow the 9th, or mountain district where the Lt. Governor lived, and it drew a 5th District with a 55.74% Black population.
I moved to amend the Chairman's plan, creating a 5th District that was 69.01% Black; my amendment was adopted, the Senate adopted a final plan encompassing my amendment, and the entire plan was sent to the House for consideration.
After the House adopted a plan which created a 51.74% Black 5th District which was rejected by the Senate, a Conference Committees were was appointed. [Two handwritten X marks appear in the right margin, pointing out the revisions to the previous sentence.] Eventually, the
7
General Assembly agreed to a plan with a 57.28 Black population 5th District.
I knew a 57% Black population majority meant a 46% Black voting minority; because Blacks are, on the whole, a younger population than whites, equal numbers of Blacks and whites will not produce equal numbers in both races old enough to vote.
I knew too — and subsequently proved in court — that voting in Atlanta had become more, not less, racially polarized in the years since Andrew Young had been elected to Congress. The election of a Black mayor in Atlanta in 1972 had decreased the possibility that white voters would cross the color line.
Atlanta's first taste of Black power had reinforced the racial tribalism of many white voters, solidifying their tendency to bloc vote.
With the assistance of Georgia's Republican Senator Mack Mattingly, I sought a meeting with William Bradford Reynolds, the Assistant Attorney General for Civil Rights.
When Senator Mattingly was unable to arrange such a meeting, I turned to State Senator Paul Coverdell (R. - Fulton), the minority leader of the state Senate. He secured a meeting with Reynolds, and Coverdell and I flew to Washington.
Reynolds received us graciously, heard our arguments, and imposed a Section 5 objection against the Georgia plan. Georgia sought a declaratory judgment against his decision in the Federal District Court in Washington.
With a number of other legislators, I intervened, and Busbee v. Smith was joined.
During the legislative debate and the court fight which followed, the proponents of a majority Black 5th District were abused and scorned in the media.
An Atlanta Constitution editorial accused me of creating a ""ghetto district"" whose representative would be ""ineffective."" Senator Paul Coverdell was shown in an editorial cartoon in a graveyard, unearthing segregation's coffin.
Coverdell and legislative Republicans were accused in the media of trying to ""pack"" Blacks from the 4th District into the 5th, solidifying the already Democratic strength of the 5th while increasing Republican hopes in the 4th.
Republicans, then as now, were willing to help Black legislators — all Democrats — create a blacker 5th by ""packing"" it with black voters and ""cracking"" and ""stacking"" concentrations of black voters elsewhere; Blacks were eager to accept whatever assistance was offered, and little was forthcoming from the members of our own party.10
8
After trial, the district court concluded that ""the 5th Congressional District was drawn to suppress black voting strength in Georgia.""11
Because the evidence of racially discriminatory intent was overwhelming, the court denied Georgia the pre-clearance it sought.
Twenty years later, the Georgia legislature ""unpacked"" the most heavily majority black districts and created so called ""influence"" districts, where blacks would be a significant, but not decisive force.
The same Supreme Court that decided Bush v. Gore ruled, by the same 5 to 4 margin, that this time Georgia was entitled to pre-clearance.12 In dissent, Justice Souter wrote that the Act's ""requirement that voting change be non-retrogressive is substantially diminished and left practically un-administrable.""
This, of course, is not the first time that the Court has undermined rights protected by the Act. In 1980, the Court required proof of discriminatory intent to successfully challenge election laws. This pernicious requirement was undone by Congress when it renewed the Act in 1982.
Beginning with Shaw v. Reno,13 in 1993, the current Court ""adopted a set of special rules and standards — amounting to an elaborate system of affirmative action for the majority — which will allow white voters to reassert their control of the political process.…""14
The Court codified white privilege just as the Act had begun to chip it away.
Among the new rules for white voters brought to us by the Supreme Court is the liberalization of ""standing"" — or who may bring a federal court case. White plaintiffs have been granted standing in redistricting cases because they alleged they were being ""stereotyped"" or ""stigmatized"" by a racial classification15 — precisely the kind of
9
injury the Court previously had rejected as sufficient for standing.
The Court also ""discovered a new constitutional right enabling white voters in North Carolina to challenge"" a congressional district ""based on its odd and irregular shapes.""16
Prior to Shaw v. Reno, the court had held that the Constitution did not require compactness, or a 'regular' shape. Suddenly, shape became suspect.
What the Court hasd done is create a constitutional right for whites not to be represented by a black person. [A handwritten X mark appears in the right margin highlighting the revision in the previous sentence.]
The Voting Rights Act of 1965 had begun to level the playing field for America's racial minorities in politics. It would be foolish to imagine that the passage of just four decades has lifted the heavy hand of white supremacy from any aspect of American life.
Critics claim that race-conscious districting diminishes democracy, but as Professor Lani Guinier has written, ""In a society as deeply cleaved by issues of racial identity as ours, there is no one race. In the presence of racial differences, a system of representation that fails to protect group representation loses legitimacy.""17
How does my story end?
Georgia subsequently passed a reapportionment plan the Justice Department found met pre-clearance standards. In an election in the 4th and 5th Districts held a month later than the general election elsewhere in Georgia, Wyche Fowler was re-elected to the United States House of Representatives from the new 5th and Rep. Elliot Levitas was re-elected from the new 4th.
Fowler was elected to the United States Senate in 1986, defeating incumbent Mattingly. He later became United States Ambassador to Saudi Arabia.
I became the first candidate in 1986 to announce for the 5th District seat but lost in a primary run-off to Atlanta City Council member John Lewis, who holds the seat today.
10
Judge Bell became Attorney General in the Carter Administration. I had the opportunity to testify against his nomination, and he took the occasion to apologize for writing the decision which kept me out of office for a year.
Maynard Jackson, who saw the 1970 Georgia legislature set the 5th District line one block past his house, served as Mayor of Atlanta from 1972 to 1980; in November 1989, he was elected Mayor again. He succeeded Andrew Young, who served from 1981 until 1990, and who was a candidate for Governor in Georgia's 1990 Democratic Primary. One of his opponents was Lt. Governor Miller who won that election and later became Georgia's Governor. You know what he has done of late. [A handwritten X mark appears in the right margin highlighting the revision in the previous sentence.]
State Senator Paul Coverdell was named Director of the Peace Corps by President George Bush and was elected to the United States Senate, defeating Wyche Fowler, in 1992. When Senator Coverdell died in office, then-retired Governor Zell Miller was named to succeed him, and later won election in his own right. You know what he has done of late.
And I have become a history teacher.
How will the Voting Rights Act end? It remains to be seen.
In the pre-1965 one-party South, voter intimidation, often lethal, was the exclusive handiwork of the nearly all-white Democratic Party. When he signed the Voting Rights Act into law, President Lyndon Johnson was prescient when he told an Aide, ""We are delivering the South to the Republicans for a generation.""
After the Act's passage and initial application, as resistant whites fled the Democratic Party and found a sympathetic home in the Republican Party and newly Ffranchised blacks joined the Democrats, these menacing and threatening practices have become the exclusive province of Republicans. [A handwritten X mark appears in the right margin highlighting the revision in the previous sentence.]
The NAACP and People for the American Way released a report last month that documents these practices over decades, up to and including the present day.
They have posted armed guards and real and make-believe policemen at the polls. They have told voters they could cast their votes on alternate days, even after the election was over. They have demanded forms of identification not required by law. They have told voters outstanding warrants or unpaid utility bills would prevent them from voting. They have said immigration officials would haunt the polls, checking on voters' immigration status. They have constructed phony purge lists which included the names of long-time legitimate voters. They have loosed the FBI and state police on elderly voters. They have set up so-called ""ballot security"" and ""ballot integrity"" programs, based on the racist presumption that minority voters are inveterate Election
11
Day cheaters, and they have harassed and intimidated those voters at will.
John Ashcroft owed his political success and eventual demise in Missouri to opposition to civil rights. As Governor, he vetoed bills that would have promoted voter registration in St. Louis, a black political stronghold. As Attorney General, Ashcroft launched the ""Voting Access and Integrity Initiative"" in 2002. The emphasis is on ""integrity"", which means intimidation of minority voters in the guise of preventing fraud in the voting process.
Now the Department of Homeland Security has even gotten into the act, attempting this month to ban a nonpartisan voter registration operation outside a naturalization ceremony in Florida.
Democracy is in trouble, my friends, and I'm not talking about Iraq.

I never met Chief Justice Earl Warren, but I sat in the Surpreme Court one day in 1965 and watched him preside as the Court heard arguments about whether or not I could take my place in the Georgia House of Representatives.
I had been elected and then expelled because of my opposition to the Vietnam War, and then elected and expelled again.
Earl Warren later announced the unanimous decision — upholding my right to free speech and my right to the seat to which my constituents had elected me.
But long before that time, I already knew of him.
On May 17th, 1954, under his leadership, the United States Supreme Court, in Brown v. Board of Education, unanimously declared that segregated schools violated the Constitution's promise of equal protection.
As we commemorate this year the 50th anniversary of that landmark decision, it is easy to cast a cynical eye on the sorry state of American race relations and minimize the significance of Brown. That is a grave mistake, for Brown — by destroying segregation's legality, gave a nonviolent army the power to destroy segregation's morality as well.
2
Thus it is no coincidence that this year we also celebrate the 40th anniversary of the passage of the 1964 Civil Rights Act — the most sweeping civil rights legislation before or since, and our democracy's finest hour.
As we have commemorated these anniversaries, 2004 has been a time to examine our present in relation to our past. And, as we prepared for and then engaged in national elections, 2004 has been a time for an examination of our present in relation to our future.
As we analyze this year's election results, one lesson is the extent to which the body politic continues to feed off race.
Karl Rove may have predicted this year's outcome, but so did Lyndon Johnson. When he signed the Civil Rights Act of 1964, Johnson told his young aide Bill Moyers, ""I think we delivered the South to the Republican Party for your lifetime and mine.""i
That year, despite his national landslide, Johnson lost five southern states, including four that the Democrats had not lost in 84 years. Now the Republicanization of the former slave states is complete. This year George W. Bush won the old Confederacy by five million votes, meaning that he lost the rest of the country by a million-and-a-half votes.
Bush's base of white fundamentalists continues in the tradition of those who ""have cut off their economic noses to spite black faces since the end of the Civil War.""ii
As the song says, ""Yesterday's just a memory, tomorrow's not what it's supposed to be."" As this election proves, history never ends.
Electoral College arithmetic means that the 55% of black voters who live in the South were as effectively disenfranchised this year as when they had no right to vote at all. The same is true of Latinos in the Southwest and Indian voters in the heartland.
3
People of color were 35% of new voters, and in their diversity were remarkably united. They were 23% of all voters, as opposed to 19% in 2000.
In 2000, Bush won the white vote by 12 points, 54 to 42; in 2004, he won white votes by 17 points, 58 to 41, turning a 500,000 vote loss four years ago into a 3.5 million winning margin this year.
We can look back on the years between Brown in 1954 and the passage of the Civil Rights Act in 1964 with some pride.
Martin Luther King's first national address was at a 1957 Prayer Pilgrimage on the third anniversary of Brown at the Lincoln Memorial.
In 1963 alone, the year that King — fresh from the battlefields of Birmingham — told the nation of his dream at the March on Washington, there were more than 10,000 anti-racist demonstrations.
King was the most famous and well known of the modern movement's personalities, but it was a people's movement. It produced leaders of its own; but it relied not on the noted but the nameless, not on the famous but the faceless. It didn't wait for commands from afar to begin a campaign against injustice. It saw wrong and acted against it; it saw evil and brought it down.
Those were the days when women and men of all races and creeds worked together in the cause of civil rights.
Those were the days when good music was popular and popular music was good. Those were the days when the President picked the Supreme Court and not the other way around.
Those were the days when we had a war on poverty, not a war on the poor. Those were the days when patriotism was a reason for open-eyed disobedience, not an excuse for blind allegiance.
4
Those were the days when the news media really was ""fair and balanced"" and not just an echo chamber for the powerful.
But those were not ""the good old days.""
In those days, ""(t)he law, the courts, the schools, and almost every institution ... favored whites. This was white supremacy.""iii
Martin Luther King described it for those who did not understand in 1962. He said then:
""When you have seen vicious mobs lynch your mothers and fathers at will and drown your sisters and brothers at whim; when you have seen hate-filled policemen curse, kick, and even kill your black brothers and sisters; when you see the vast majority of your twenty million Negro brothers smothering in an airtight cage of poverty in the midst of an affluent society; when you suddenly find your tongue twisted and your speech stammering as you seek to explain to your six-year-old daughter why she can't go to the public amusement park that has just been advertised on television, and see tears welling up in her eyes when she is told that Funtown is closed to colored children, and see ominous clouds of inferiority beginning to form in her little mental sky, and see her beginning to distort her personality by developing an unconscious bitterness toward white people; when you have to concoct an answer for a five year-old son who is asking: ""Daddy, why do white people treat colored people so mean?"" ... when you are harried by day and haunted by night by the fact that you are a Negro, living constantly on tip-toe stance, never quite knowing what to expect next, and are plagued with inner fears and outer resentments; when you are forever fighting a degenerating sense of 'nobodiness' — then,"" King concluded, ""you will understand.""

[Marginal comment using copyediting term that indicates reversing the previous paragraph's strikethrough.] stet
You would understand that most southern Blacks could not vote. They attended inadequate, segregated schools, if they went at all, and many attended only a few months each year. Most could not hope to gain an education beyond high school. Most worked as farmers, or semi-skilled
5
laborers. Few owned the land they farmed, or even the homes in which they lived.
When Earl Warren's Supreme Court announced that the white South could make haste slowly in dismantling segregated schools, I was a year older than Emmet Till.
His death three months after Brown II in 1955 was more immediate to me than the Supreme Court's decision had been. We were nearly the same age when he was murdered, in Money, Mississippi, for whistling at a white woman. His death and the black newspapers that came into my Pennsylvania home had created a great vulnerability and fear of all things southern in my teenaged mind, and when my parents announced in 1957 that we were relocating to Atlanta, I was filled with dread.
Emmett Till's death had terrified me. But in the fall of 1957 a group of black teenagers encouraged me to put that fear aside. These young people — the nine young women and men who integrated Central High School in Little Rock, Arkansas — set a high standard of grace and courage under fire as they dared the mobs who surrounded their school.
Here, I thought, is what I hope I can be, if ever the chance comes my way.
The chance to test and prove myself did come my way in 1960, as it came to thousands of other black high school and college students across the South. First through the sit-ins, then in Freedom Rides, and then in the voter registration and political organizing drive in the rural South, we joined an old movement against white supremacy that had deep, strong roots; for many of us, however, it was the recent Brown decisions that had created the opportunity for young people to play active roles, to seize and share leadership in the movement for social justice.
6
Brown was the movement's greatest legal victory. It changed the legal status of black Americans, and made challenges to the established movement's narrow reliance on legal action possible. 
As Richard Kluger has written:
""Not until the Supreme Court acted in 1954 did the nation acknowledge it had been blaming the black man for what it had done to him. His sentence to second class citizenship had been commuted; the quest for meaningful equality — equality in fact as well as in law — had begun.""iv

I believe in an integrated America — jobs, homes, and schools. I believe in it enough to have spent most of my life in its elusive pursuit. I think it is a legal, moral and political imperative for America — a matter of elemental justice, simple right waged against historical wrong.
I not only have spent most of my life in the cause of integration, in 1947 — when I was seven years old — I was a plaintiff in a lawsuit in rural Pennsylvania against segregated schools.
It never came to trial. The school board had segregated schools by giving students achievement tests which all blacks failed and all whites passed, but when the two dumb sons of the local white political boss failed the test, they closed the black school, and all of Lincoln University Village's children went to a one-room school together.
Last year I visited Berea College in Kentucky, opened by abolitionists as an integrated school in 1855. It was closed by the Civil War, but opened again in 1866 with 187 students — 96 blacks and 91 whites. It dared to provide a rare commodity in the former slave states — an education open to all — blacks and whites, women and men.
One of those early students was my grandfather, James Bond.
7
Like many others, I am the grandson of a slave. My grandfather was born in 1863, in Kentucky; freedom didn't come for him until the 13th Amendment was ratified in 1865.
He and his mother were property, like a horse or a chair. As a young girl, she had been given away as a wedding present to a new bride, and when that bride became pregnant, her husband — that's my great-grandmother's owner and master — exercised his right to take his wife's slave as his mistress.
That union produced two children, one of them my grandfather.
At age 15, barely able to read and write, he hitched his tuition — a steer — to a rope and walked across Kentucky to Berea College and the college took him in.
My grandfather belonged to a transcendent generation of black Americans, a generation born into slavery, freed by the Civil War, determined to make their way as free women and men. From Berea, he studied for the ministry, married, and had six children — one of them my father, Horace Mann Bond.
My father graduated from Pennsylvania's Lincoln University and earned a doctorate in education from the University of Chicago. For him, too, education was a means to a larger end — the uplift of his people and the salvation of his race.
How, fitting, then, that he would be asked to help the NAACP in its legal campaign against school segregation — the campaign that culminated in Brown v. Board of Education.
There can be no mistake — those fifty years since Brown have seen the fortunes of black America advance and retreat, but the decision is always cause for sober celebration, not impotent dismay.
8
We celebrate the brilliant legal minds who were the architects of Brown v. Board; we celebrate the brave families who were its plaintiffs; and we celebrate the legal principle that remains its enduring legacy — that in the words of Chief Justice Earl Warren, ""the doctrine of separate but equal has no place.""v
That the quest for meaningful equality — political and economic equity — remains unfulfilled today is no indictment of past efforts. It is testament to our challenge.
When my grandfather graduated from Berea, in 1892, the college asked him to deliver the commencement address.
He said then:
""The pessimist from his corner looks out on the world of wickedness and sin, and blinded by all that is good or hopeful in the condition and progress of the human race, bewails the present state of affairs and predicts woeful things for the future.""
""In every cloud he beholds a destructive storm, in every flash of lightning an omen of evil, and in every shadow that falls across his path a lurking foe.""
""He forgets that the clouds also bring life and hope, that lightning purifies the atmosphere, that shadow and darkness prepare for sunshine and growth, and that hardships and adversity nerve the race, as the individual, for greater efforts and grander victories.""vi

""Greater efforts and grander victories."" That was the promise made by the generation born in slavery more than 140 years ago. That was the promise made by the generation that won the great world war for democracy almost six decades ago. That was the promise made by those who brought democracy to America's darkest corners four decades ago, and that is the promise we must all seek to honor today.
9
We meet on the heels of a Presidential election which, among other things, gives credence to the old adage, ""the more things change, the more they remain the same.""
In the face of momentous events and changes in our national lives since 2000, voting patterns and results were remarkably unchanged from that election to this one. With the exception of three states whose razor-thin margins reversed, the electoral map in 2004 was identical to the electoral map in 2000.
More people voted against George W. Bush than any Presidential candidate in American history, giving him ""the narrowest win for a sitting president since Woodrow Wilson in 1916.vii He received a smaller share of black votes than Nixon, Ford, Dole, or Ronald Reagan in 1980.
Both sides mobilized their supporters, but Republicans did it better — fostering division with precision.
Just as ""weapons of mass destruction"" morphed into ""weapons of mass destruction program related activities,"" yesterday's ""family values"" morphed into ""moral values"" — because there are some families they don't like.
""Moral values"" trumped terrorism, war, the economy and jobs for 20% of voters, 80% of whom supported George W. Bush. A shift of 70,000 votes in Ohio would have cost Bush the Presidency. But Ohio, the state that suffered the greatest job loss in the nation, went to Bush, thanks to a same-sex marriage amendment on the ballot.
Vote totals show an America divided: men versus women, whites versus non-whites, married versus unmarried, straight versus gay, old versus young, conservatives versus liberals, Protestants versus Jews, rural Americans versus urbanites.
10
So we have a country divided roughly 50/50 but a government held entirely by one side. And each side believes the other leads down the road to perdition, giving new meaning to Woody Guthrie's famous refrain — ""this land is your land, this land is my land.""
I would rather have had the election turn on issues of war and peace than on issues of race and sex. I thought we had 10 commandments. What happened to the ones against lying, stealing, and killing?
The NAACP opposed unilateral war against Iraq, but we are as one with all Americans in supporting our fighting forces. We pray for their swift return to America's shores and a just and lasting peace at home and abroad.
Iraq has been turned into a terrorist's playground. The war has increased the threats we face and decreased our ability to meet them.
When Martin Luther King spoke out against the war in Vietnam in 1965, he was revolted at the hypocrisy of America's claims for freedom overseas when blacks enjoyed few freedoms here. War abroad, he said, stole from Americans at home.
""The pursuit of widened war,"" he said, ""has narrowed domestic welfare programs, making the poor, white and Negro, bear the heaviest burdens at the front and at home.""

In 1976, a year to the day before he was killed, King delivered a speech at New York's Riverside Church condemning the war in Vietnam.
Substitute ""Iraq"" for ""Vietnam"" and ""terrorism"" for ""communism"" and listen as he speaks to us today. He said:
""The war in Iraq is but a symptom of a far deeper malady in the American spirit. ... I am convinced that if we are to get on the right side of the world revolution, we as a nation must undergo a radical revolution of values. We must rapidly begin the shift from a ""thing-oriented"" society to a ""person-oriented"" society. When machines and computers, profit motives and
11
property rights are considered more important than people, the giant triplets of racism, materialism, and militarism are incapable of being conquered.""
""America, the richest and most powerful nation in the world, can well lead the way in this revolution of values. There is nothing, except a tragic death wish, to prevent us from reordering our priorities, so that the pursuit of peace will take priority over the pursuit of war. ... This kind of positive revolution of values is our best defense against terrorism.""viii

We know America's twin towers — freedom and justice — are still standing. It remains our job to keep upright what others would weaken and destroy. America is strongest when she is just; she is fiercest when her people are free.
Less than a week after the September 11 attacks, President George W. Bush went to the Washington Islamic Center. Standing in his stockinged feet, the President vowed to prevent hate crimes and discrimination against Arabs and Muslims in the wake of the attacks. A year later on the first anniversary of the attacks, he renewed this vow.
The goals the President stated — retaliation against terrorists abroad and promotion of tolerance at home — are reminiscent of the 'Double V' campaign waged by blacks during World War II: it then symbolized victory against fascism abroad and racism at home.
Today we realize we have not achieved either victory — not yet against tyranny abroad — not yet against racism here at home.
Just as this enemy — terrorism — is more difficult to identify and punish, so is discrimination a more elusive target today.
12
No more do signs read ""white"" and ""colored."" The law now requires the voters' booth and schoolhouse door to swing open for everyone. No longer are they closed to those whose skins are black.
But despite impressive increases in the numbers of black people holding public office, despite our ability to sit, eat, ride, vote, and go to school in places that used to bar black faces, in some important ways nonwhite Americans face problems more difficult to attack now than in the years that went before.
We believe these problems, old ones and new ones, have their root in race and racial discrimination.
So when we are asked why the NAACP doesn't focus on social service, and why we don't surrender to the great tutorial instinct so prominent among blacks in the middle class, the urge to instruct our less fortunate brothers and sisters and their children in the proper way of doing things, of saving, or learning and speaking, we respond that we are an organization that fights racial discrimination. There are thousands of organizations in America which deliver social service, and properly so. The NAACP is one of the few which concentrates on social justice.
We believe that racial discrimination is a prime reason why the gaps between black and white life chances remain so wide. And we believe that to the degree we are able to reduce discrimination and close these race-caused gaps, we will see the economic and educational lives of our people improve and their prosperity increase. We believe when our people have social justice, they won't need social service.
13
If you think that racial discrimination and white supremacy no longer reign in America, consider this. While America was deciding who would be President, Alabama voters also had an amendment on their ballots which would have eliminated segregationist language from their state's constitution. It was defeated. This is the same state in which forty percent of voters, more than half-a-million people, voted against interracial marriage in 2002. This is also the same state that this year elected to its Supreme Court a man who drew his support from the pro-secession and pro-Confederacy Alabama League of the South — and who handed out small Confederate flags. Of course, the League of the South is not confined to Alabama — and neither are Confederate flags and the sentiments — and the values — of the hands that hold them.
The NAACP, whose Board I chair, has always been non-partisan, but that doesn't mean we're non-critical. And it doesn't mean we're non compos mentis. [non compos mentis translates to ""of unsound mind.""]
While the election's losers — rightly — will be encouraged to examine their mistakes, the winners ought to ponder their failure to penetrate the black political consensus.
The passage of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and the Voting Rights Act of 1965 marked the beginning of the dependence of one of our political parties on the politics of racial division to win elections and gain power. By playing the race card in election after election, they've appealed to the dark underside of American culture, to the minority of Americans who reject democracy and equality.
They preach racial neutrality and practice racial division. They celebrate Martin Luther King and misuse his message.
14
Their idea of reparations is to give war criminal Jefferson Davis a pardon.
Their idea of a pristine environment is a parking lot before the lines are painted in.
Their idea of equal rights is the American and Confederate flags flying side by side.
We believe in the Golden Rule; they believe he who has the gold should rule.
Their idea of compassion is to ask the guests at the millionaires' banquet if they want an extra helping and a second dessert.
They've tried to patch the leaky economy — and every other domestic problem — with duct tape and plastic sheets.
They draw their most rabid supporters from the Taliban wing of American politics.
They write a new Constitution for Iraq and try to re-write the Constitution here at home.
Now they want to write bigotry into the Constitution; they want to make one group of Americans outsiders to our common heritage. They want to do what has never been done before — to amend the Constitution to create a group of second-class citizens. The Constitution is the last hope of freedom; it cannot become a carrier of prejudice and intolerance.
And what about the opposition party? Too often they're not an opposition, they're an amen corner. While one party has been whistling Dixie, the other has been whistling in the dark.
With some notable exceptions, they have been absent without leave from this battle for America's soul.
15
When one party is shameless, the other party cannot afford to be spineless.
If one party runs on values, the other party cannot run on policy alone. Tolerance is a value. Inclusion is a value. Respect for difference is a value. Stewardship of the air and water is a value. Concern for the poor and disadvantaged is a value.
The Democrats rolled over on tax cuts for the wealthy and on the war in Iraq. They failed to campaign in the South, and when Al Sharpton and Carol Mosley Braun left the campaign, so did any concern for urban issues. After a challenging primary season, the Democrats chose ideological disarmament, embracing many of their opponents' positions.
So successful has the right wing been in labeling discussions of economic inequality as class warfare that most have not noticed that the war is on and the working class is losing. Longer hours, lower pay, vanishing health care, outsourcing jobs — this is the new economy.
Our economic imbalances not only mean difficult times for many, they also undermine democratic values. The danger is that plutocracy will prevail over democracy, and the free market will rule over the free citizen.
The reason for the current deficit and the vanished surplus can be placed squarely on the tax giveaways to the rich. They constitute a massive transfer of the costs of government further and further down the income scale.
To make up for just the initial tax cuts, we would have to cut spending by $5 billion dollars 5 days a week for over a year. That was the whole point — to further enrich the already wealthy and to starve the government, making it unable to meet human needs, signing a death warrant for social programs
16
for decades to come. It is nothing less than organized looting of the public purse.
If black Americans wanted to close the wealth gap between blacks and whites, they would have to go without food, shelter, clothing and all other expenses for more than a decade.
We have a President who talks like a populist and governs for the privileged.
We were promised compassionate conservatism; instead, we got crony capitalism.
We have an Attorney General — thankfully retiring — who is a cross between J. Edgar Hoover and Jerry Falwell.
We have a Senate Majority Leader who has voted consistently against labor rights, against civil rights, and against women's rights. And he's the one who replaced the bad guy!
Only one Senator — Russell Feingold of Wisconsin — voted against the first hastily prepared and ill-considered terrorism measure proposed after September 11.
He explained his vote this way:
""If we lived in a country that allowed the police to search our home at any time for any reason; if we lived in a country that allowed the government to open your mail, eavesdrop on your phone conversations, or intercept your email communications; if we lived in a country that allowed the government to hold people indefinitely in jail based on what they write or think, or based on mere suspicion that they are up to no good, then the government would no doubt discover and arrest more terrorists. But that probably would not be a country in which we would want to live.""ix

17
Nor do we want to live in country that permits infiltration and surveillance of religious and political organizations. Yet, the new FBI guidelines proposed by J. Edgar Ashcroft do just that.
Just as we remember J. Edgar Hoover, we remember his counter-intelligence program, called COINTELPRO.
And whose intelligence did they want to counter? In a program called ""Racial Matters"", the FBI tried to disrupt the civil rights movement. They tried to smear Martin Luther King, Jr. They not only wanted him discredited, they wanted him dead. They threatened him with the release of damaging information if he did not take his own life.
We thought we had put a stop to Hoover's programs of spies and lies in the 1970s after these abuses were exposed. Now, under the guise of fighting terrorism, the FBI is going back to spying on law-abiding citizens.
War and fear often cause hasty mistakes, costly both in economic and human terms. We need to remember what we are fighting for.
In the summer of 1918, on the eve of America's entry into World War I, one of the NAACP's founders, W. E. B. Du Bois, urged blacks to:
""...forget our special grievances and close ranks shoulder to shoulder with our fellow citizens and the allied nations that are fighting for democracy.""

The criticism he faced then was immediate and loud. He quickly reversed his position and realized then — as we must now — that calls for a retreat from our rights are always wrong.
He understood then — as we must now — that when wars are fought to claim to save democracy, the first casualty is usually democracy itself.
That is why we must be vigilant against the steady erosion of American values and the basic rights we hold dear.
18
We ought to remember the words of President Theodore Roosevelt, who said in 1918,
""To announce there must be no criticism of the President, or to stand by the President, right or wrong, is not only unpatriotic and servile, but is morally treasonous to the American public.""

And the words of Ohio Senator Robert Taft, who said two weeks after Pearl Harbor had been attacked:
""I believe there can be no doubt that criticism in time of war is essential to the maintenance of any kind of democratic government.""

The FBI and the CIA kept files on me in the 1960s, and thanks to the ACLU, we'll soon know how extensive their spying is today. They may be keeping files on me today. I know the IRS is. But while they were watching and following and photographing and wiretapping those of us working nonviolently in the freedom movement, a wave of white terrorism was sweeping across the South unchallenged. It has taken 40 years and more to bring a pitiful few of those terrorists to justice.
And it has taken 40 years and more to put in place a framework for civil rights enforcement, now threatened on several fronts.
The Administrations's judicial nominees are hostile to the basic principles of civil rights law and civil rights enforcement. They oppose the core constitutional principle of ""one person, one vote."" They've supported federal funding for racially discriminatory schools. They've tried to re-write anti-discrimination laws from the bench, and they've eroded Congressional authority to pass laws that protect civil rights.x
Organizations dedicated to overturning the gains of the civil rights movement are now dictating public policy.
19
Their very names are fraudulent and their aims are frightening.
They have already stolen our vocabulary, and they want to steal the just spoils of our righteous war. Sophisticated and well funded, over the past decade they have won several victories in the plot to dismantle justice and fair play.
For more than a decade, they have waged ideological war against moderation in the federal judiciary and then squeal the loudest when the extremists they support are rejected.
Now they have ascended to unprecedented positions of power within the federal government. Small wonder that a recent study concluded that ""federal enforcement of civil rights law has dropped sharply since 1999.""xi
There is a right wing conspiracy, and it controls the administration, both houses of Congress, much of the judiciary, and a major portion of the media.
They want to make any government consideration of race illegal, and thereby do away with our rights and much of the legacy of the civil rights movement, including affirmative action. They say they believe in a colorblind America, where race doesn't count. Sadly, in America, equal opportunity is color-coded. What they really want is a color-free America, and they think they'll get there by not counting race. But as long as race counts, we've got to count race.
Affirmative action was created to fight what Supreme Court Justice Sandra Day O'Connor has called ""the unhappy persistence of both the practice and the lingering effects of racial discrimination."" Affirmative action has been under attack not because it has failed but because it has succeeded.
20
It created the sizeable middle class that now constitutes one-third of all black Americans. In the late 1960s, the wages of black women in the textile industry tripled. From 1970 to 1990, the number of black police officers, lawyers, and doctors doubled. Black electricians and college students tripled; black bank tellers more than quadrupled.
The opponents keep telling us affirmative action carries a stigma which attaches to all blacks — as if none of us ever felt any stigma in the days before the words ""affirmative action"" were ever spoken.
Why don't they ever make this argument about the millions of whites who got into Harvard or Yale because Dad was president of the company — or President of the United States?
You never see them walking around, heads held low, moaning that everyone in the executive washroom is whispering about how they got their jobs.
Most of our entire elite professions have long been the near-exclusive preserve of white men. I seriously doubt if a single one of these men is suffering low self-esteem because he knows — everyone knows — his race and gender helped him win his job.
Look at it this way — it is the fourth quarter in a football game between the black team and the white team. The white team is ahead 145 to 3. They own the ball, the uniforms, the field, the goalposts, and the referees. All of a sudden the white quarterback, who feels badly about things that happened before he entered the game, turns to the black team and says: ""Hey fellows, can't we just play fair?""
Of course, playing fair in this game is double-speak for freezing the status quo in place, permanently fixing inequality as part of American life.
21
Affirmative action is not about preferential treatment for blacks; rather, it is about removing the preferential treatment whites have received for centuries, giving equal treatment to people previously denied equality.
Without it, both white and blue collars around black and brown necks would shrink, with a huge depressive effect on income, education, home ownership, and life chances.
As quiet as it is kept by those who declare themselves 'colorblind' in his name, Martin Luther King supported affirmative action. He said in 1963:
""It is impossible to create a formula for the future which does not take into account that society has been doing something special against the Negro for hundreds of years. How then can he be absorbed into the mainstream of American life if we do not do something special for him now, in order to balance the equation and equip him to compete on a just and equal basis?""xii

[Marginal comment using copyediting term that indicates reversing the previous paragraph's strikethrough.] stet
President Bush chose Martin Luther King's birthday last year to announce that, even though he admits society continues to do something special against racial minorities,xiii his administration would not do anything special for them; he opposed the University of Michigan's efforts to promote diversity among its student body.
That is so ironic — after all, the Bush family has enjoyed generations of preferences at Yale University: preferences for first daughter, for her father before her, and for his father before him.
The Bush Administration likes to use Secretary of State Colin Powell and National Security Adviser Condoleezza Rice as human shields against any criticism of its record on civil rights. After all, Bush is proud of boasting, his Administration is more diverse than any in history — except the one that preceded it.
22
But the day after the administration filed its brief in the Michigan cases, Ms. Rice issued a rare statement on a domestic issue, saying, ""(I)t is appropriate to use race as one factor among others in achieving a diverse student body.xiv And Ms. Rice has acknowledged that affirmative action was responsible for her employment at Stanford University.xv
Secretary Powell, for his part, has long been an outspoken advocate for affirmative action and specifically said he hoped the University of Michigan would prevail in court.
The Civil War that freed my grandfather was fought over whether blacks and whites shared a common humanity. Less than ten years after it ended, the nation chose sides with the losers and agreed to continue black repression for almost 100 years. The freed slaves found that their former masters once again controlled their fate.
American slavery was a human horror of staggering dimensions, a crime against humanity. The profits it produced endowed great fortunes and enriched generations, and its dreadful legacy embraces all of us today.
As John Hope Franklin writes:
""All whites ... benefited from American slavery. All blacks had no rights they could claim as their own. All whites, including the vast majority who owned no slaves, were not only encouraged but authorized to exercise dominion over all slaves, thereby adding to the system of control.""
""... even poor whites benefited from the legal advantage they enjoyed over all blacks as well as from the psychological advantage of having a group beneath them.""
""Most living Americans do have a connection with slavery. They have inherited the preferential advantage, if they are white, and the loathsome disadvantage, if they are black, and these positions are virtually as alive today as they were in the 19th Century.""xvi

23
That is inherited white privilege — it is truly the gift that keeps on giving.
Two hundred and forty-six years of slavery were followed by 100 years of state-sanctioned discrimination, reinforced by public and private terror, ending only after a protracted struggle in 1965.
Thus it has been only a short 39 years that all black Americans have been allowed to exercise the full rights of citizens, only 39 years since legal segregation was ended nationwide, only 39 years since the protections of the law and Constitution were officially extended to all.
And now some are telling us those 39 years have been enough.
To believe that is the victory of hope over experience.
To believe that is the victory of self-delusion over common sense.
The removal, over the decades since the 1960s, of the more blatant forms of American apartheid, has made it too easy for too many to believe today that all forms of discrimination have disappeared.
Opinion polls reveal that a majority of whites believe that racial discrimination is no longer a major impediment for people of color. In one study, 75 percent of whites said that blacks face no discrimination in obtaining jobs or housings even as such discrimination becomes more severe. In another poll, two-thirds of whites said they were ""personally satisfied"" with the way black Americans are treated in society.
Polls show that most white Americans believe equal educational opportunity exists right now, even as our schools become more, not less segregated, across the country. xvii
24
The successful strategies of the modern movement for civil rights were litigation, organization, mobilization and coalition, all aimed at creating a national constituency for civil rights.
Sometimes the simplest of ordinary, everyday acts — sitting at a lunch counter, going to a new school, applying for a marriage license — can have unforeseen results.
It can change the universe, it can challenge the way we think and act.
The movement marched and picketed and protested against state-sanctioned segregation, and brought that system crashing to its knees.
Today's times require no less, and in fact insist on more.
Now as we find ourselves re-fighting old battles we thought already won and facing new problems we have barely begun to acknowledge, we ought to take heart. If there is more to be done, we have more to do it with, much more than those who came before us and who brought us along this far.
As a nation, we have a history of aggressive self-help and voluntarism, in church and civic club and neighborhood association, providing scholarships, helping the needy, promoting social service.
But volunteering for social service alone does little to change the status quo. Creating change requires challenging power.
It is never enough just to ignore evil. It is never enough just to do good. It is never enough just to feed the hungry and house the homeless, as commendable as these deeds are.
It may be helpful to think about our task in this way:
25
Two men are sitting by a river and see, to their great surprise, a helpless baby floating by. They rescue the child, and to their horror, another baby soon comes floating down the stream. When that child is pulled to safety, another baby comes along. As one man plunges into the river a third time, the other rushes upstream.
""Come back!"" yells the man in the water. ""We must save this baby!""
""You save it,"" the other yells back. ""I'm going to find out who is throwing babies in the river and I'm going to make them stop!""
I recently heard Professor Lani Guinier say that minorities are like the canaries that miners used to carry to warn them when the underground air was becoming too toxic to breathe.
But too many people want to put gas masks on the canaries instead of eliminating the poison in the air. Too many want to put life preservers on the babies, instead of stopping them from being thrown into a treacherous, dangerous flood.
We have a long and honorable tradition of social justice in this country. It still sends forth the message that when we act together we can overcome.
And we have a revitalized NAACP prepared for the challenges that lie ahead.xviii
It is a serious mistake — both tactical and moral — to believe this is a fight that must be waged by black Americans alone. That has never been so in centuries past; it ought not to be so in the century unfolding now.
Black, yellow, red and white — all are needed in this fight.
All of us are implicated in the continuation of inequality — it will require our common effort to bring it to an end.
26
The election doesn't change the task before us. If it makes it more difficult, it also makes it more imperative.
A progressive-agenda for this new century must include continuing to litigate, to organize, to mobilize, forming coalitions of the caring and concerned, joining ranks against the comfortable, the callous and the smug.
We must fight discrimination, wherever it raises its ugly head — in the halls of government, in corporate suites or in the streets.
We must demand fair treatment for people with HIV/AIDS. This disease strikes African-American women more than any other group. It doesn't happen to ""others"" — it happens to all of us.
We must demand that ""criminal justice"" cease being an oxymoron. We know race, more than any other factor, determines who is arrested, who is tried and for what crime, who receives what length of sentence, and who receives the ultimate punishment — and we are determined that it stop.
We must insure that our children — in inner city and suburban and rural schools — receive the best education, an education that prepares them for the century just begun.
We must provide health care, protect Social Security, and promote peace.
There is much more — none of it easy work, but we have never wished our way to freedom. Instead, we have always worked our way.
By the year 2050, blacks and Hispanics together will be 40% of the nation's population.
Whenever there are others who share our condition or concerns, we must make common cause with them. In the NAACP, we believe colored people come in all colors — anyone who shares our values is more than welcome.
27
The growth in immigration and the emergence of new and vibrant populations of people of color hold great promise and great peril. The promise is that the coalition for justice has grown larger and stronger, as new allies join the fight.
The peril comes from real fears that our common foes will find ways to separate and divide us. It doesn't make sense if blacks and Latinos fight over which group has less power; together we can constitute a mighty force for right.
Racial justice, economic equality, and world peace — these were the themes that occupied King's life; they ought to occupy ours today.
We know our world and our lives have changed since September 11, 2001. We don't know by how much even yet. But we know we have a job to do at home as much as abroad.
When I started working four decades ago, there were five workers paying into the national retirement system for every retiree.
I can't possibly know who my five were, but their names could easily have been Carl, Ralph, Bob, Steve, and Bill.
When I retire, there will only be three workers paying into the retirement system — their names could easily be Tamika, Maria, and Jose.
We need to insure they have the best schools, the best health care, the best jobs, and the strongest protections against discrimination we possibly can.

He was twenty-five years old.
One month later, on May 17th, 1954, the United States Supreme Court, in Brown v. Board of Education, unanimously declared that segregated schools violated the Constitution's promise of equal protection.
Two months later, on July 17, 1954, construction began at Disneyland. Sadly, today Brown's promise is still lost in fantasy land. The Magic Kingdom remains closed to children of color in America.
There can be no mistake — those fifty years since Brown have seen the fortunes of black America advance and retreat, but the decision is always cause for sober celebration, not impotent dismay.
We celebrate the brilliant legal minds who were the architects of Brown v. Board; we celebrate the brave families who were its plaintiffs; and we celebrate the legal principle that remains its enduring legacy — that, in the words of Chief Justice Earl Warren, ""the doctrine of separate but equal has no place.""i
That the quest for meaningful equality — political and economic equity — remains unfulfilled today is no indictment of past efforts. It is testament to our challenge.
2
As we commemorate the 50th anniversary of that landmark decision, it is easy to cast a cynical eye on the status of school desegregation in America today — or the sorry state of race relations — and minimize the significance of Brown. That is a grave mistake, for Brown — by destroying segregation's legality, gave a nonviolent army the power to destroy segregation's morality as well.
Thus it is no coincidence that this year we also celebrate the 40th anniversary of the passage of the 1964 Civil Rights Act — the most sweeping civil rights legislation before or since, and our democracy's finest hour.
We look back on the years between Brown and the passage of the 1964 Civil Rights Act with some pride.
In those years, Brown's anniversary became a celebratory signpost, as major events focused on commemorating the date.
The year after Brown, Rosa Parks sat down to stand up for her rights, and the Montgomery bus boycott began.
Martin Luther King's first national address was at a 1957 Prayer Pilgrimmage on the third anniversary of Brown at the Lincoln Memorial.
Later that same year the Little Rock Nine successfully integrated Little Rock's Central High School.
Sit-ins at segregated lunch counters burst out across the South in 1960, followed by the Freedom Rides of 1961 and the forcible integration of Old Miss in 1962.
In 1963 alone, the year that King — fresh from the battlefields of Birmingham — told the nation his dream at the March on Washington, there were more than 10,000 anti-racist demonstrations.
King was the most famous and well known of the modern movement's personalities, but it was a people's movement. It produced
3
leaders of its own, but it relied not on the noted but the nameless, not on the famous but the faceless. It didn't wait for commands from afar to begin a campaign against injustice. It saw wrong and acted against it; it saw evil and brought it down.
Those were the days when women and men of all races and creeds worked together in the cause of civil rights.
Those were the days when good music was popular and popular music was good.
Those were the days when the President picked the Supreme Court and not the other way around.
Those were the days when we had a war on poverty, not a war on the poor. Those were the days when patriotism was a reason for open-eyed disobedience, not an excuse for blind allegiance.
Those were the days when the news media really was ""fair and balanced"" and not just cheerleaders for the powerful.
But those were not ""the good old days.""
Then, the American social order was rigidly stratified and racially codified.
In those days, ""(t)he law, the courts, the schools, and almost every institution ... favored whites. This was white supremacy.""ii
Martin Luther King described it in 1962. He said then:
""When you have seen vicious mobs lynch your mothers and fathers at will and drown your sisters and brothers at whim; when you have seen hate-filled policemen curse, kick, and even kill your black brothers and sisters; when you see the vast majority of your twenty million Negro brothers smothering in an airtight cage of poverty in the midst of an affluent society; when you suddenly find your tongue twisted and your speech stammering as you seek to explain to your six-year-old
4
daughter why she can't go to the public amusement park that has just been advertised on television, and see tears welling up in her eyes when she is told that Funtown is closed to colored children, and see ominous clouds of inferiority beginning to form in her little mental sky, and see her beginning to distort her personality by developing an unconscious bitterness toward white people, when you have to concoct an answer for a five-year-old son who is asking, ""Daddy, why do white people treat colored people so mean?"" ... when you are harried by day and haunted by night by the fact that you are a Negro, living constantly on tip-toe stance, never quite knowing what to expect next, and are plagued with inner fears and outer resentments, when you are forever fighting a degenerating sense of 'nobodiness' — then,"" King concluded, ""you will understand.""
You would understand that most southern Blacks could not vote. Most attended inadequate, segregated schools, if they went at all, and many attended only a few months each year. Most could not hope to gain an education beyond high school. Most worked as farmers, or semi-skilled laborers. Few owned the land they farmed, or even the homes in which they lived.
This was a massive system of racial preferences, a vast affirmative action plan for whites — enforced by law and terror. It had one name and one aim — crush the human development of a whole population. It began with slave-catching in Africa, and it continues on to the present day.
Only by acknowledging the name, nature and scope of the problem can we measure the magnitude of our successes — and the costs of our failures.
The day Brown was decided, the NAACP held a news conference to announce an ambitious new agenda. To Thurgood Marshall, Brown was the Magna Carta of black America, a declaration of our rights. School
5
segregation would be eliminated, he thought, within five years. He was right about the former; he was obviously wrong about the latter.
Within a year, in Brown II, the Supreme Court allowed desegregation to proceed ""with all deliberate speed."" For the first time, the Court had declared a right and delayed its implementation.
Three months after Brown II, Emmett Till, who was nearly my age, was murdered in Money, Mississippi, for whistling at a white woman. His death and the black newspapers that came into my Pennsylvania home created a great vulnerability and fear of all things southern in my teenaged mind. When my parents announced in 1957 that we were relocating to Atlanta, I was filled with dread.
Emmett Till's death had frightened me. But in the fall of 1957 a group of black teenagers encouraged me to put that fear aside. These young people — the nine young women and men who integrated Central High School in Little Rock, Arkansas — set a standard of grace and courage under fire as they dared the mobs who surrounded their school.
Here, I thought, is what I hope I can be, if ever the chance comes my way.
The chance to test and prove myself did come my way in 1960, as it came to thousands of other black high school and college students across the South. First through the sit-ins, then in Freedom Rides, and then in the voter registration and political organizing drives in the rural South, we joined an old movement against white supremacy that had deep, strong roots; for many of us, however, it was the recent Brown decision that had created the opportunity for young people to play active roles, to seize and share leadership in the movement for social justice.
6
Brown was the movement's greatest legal victory. It changed the legal status of black Americans, and ironically made challenges to the established movement's narrow reliance on legal action possible.
As Richard Kluger has written:
""Not until the Supreme Court acted in 1954 did the nation acknowledge it had been blaming the black man for what it had done to him. His sentence to second class citizenship had been commuted; the quest for meaningful equality — equality in fact as well as in law — had begun.""iii

I believe in an integrated America — integrated jobs, homes and schools. I believe in it enough to have spent most of my life in its elusive pursuit. I think it is a legal, moral and political imperative for America — a matter of elemental justice, simple right waged against historical wrong.
As Jack Greenberg, one of the attorneys for the Brown plaintiffs, put it:
""The other side's briefs talked about federalism, separation of powers, textualism.
Ours talked about right and wrong.""iv

And black and white. Brown was about black inequality, what Lyndon Johnson called ""the one huge wrong of the American nation.""v
""The Supreme Court said nothing about Latinos until nineteen years after Brown and there never was any significant enforcement of desegregation for Latinos.""vi
Today, ""U. S. schools are becoming more segregated in all regions for both African-American and Latino students.""vii
By contrast, Asian students are the most integrated.viii
7
I not only have spent most of my life in the cause of integration, in 1947 — when I was seven years old — I was a plaintiff in a lawsuit in rural Pennsylvania against segregated schools.
It never came to trial. The school board had segregated schools by giving students achievement tests which all blacks failed and all whites passed, but when the two dumb sons of the local white political boss failed the test, they closed the black school, and all of Lincoln University Village's children went to a one-room school together.
Last year I visited Berea College in Kentucky, open by abolitionists as an integrated school in 1855. It was closed by the Civil War, but opened again in 1866 with 187 students — 96 blacks and 91 whites. It dared to provide a rare commodity in the former slave states: an education open to all — blacks and whites, women and men.
One of those early students was my grandfather, James Bond.
Like many others, I am the grandson of a slave. My grandfather was born in 1863, in Kentucky; freedom didn't come for him until the 13th Amendment was ratified in 1865.
He and his mother were property, like a horse or a chair. As a young girl, she had been given away as a wedding present to a new bride, and when that bride became pregnant, her husband — that's my great-grandmother's owner and master — exercised his right to take his wife's slave as his mistress.
That union produced two children, one of them my grandfather.
At age 15, barely able to read and write, he hitched his tuition — a steer — to a rope and walked across Kentucky to Berea College and the college took him in.
My grandfather belonged to a transcendent generation of black
8
Americans, a generation born into slavery, a generation freed from servitude by the Civil War, a generation determined to make their way as free women and men. From Berea, he studied for the ministry, married, and had six children — one of them my father, Horace Mann Bond.
My father graduated from Pennsylvania's Lincoln University and earned a doctorate in education from the University of Chicago. For him, too, education was a means to a larger end — the uplift of his people and the salvation of his race.
How fitting, then, that he would be asked to help the NAACP in its legal campaign against school segregation — the campaign that culminated in Brown v. Board of Education.
When Brown was before the Supreme Court, both its presenters and the Justices who heard it understood clearly its historic potential. In an unusual, but not unheard of procedure, the case — actually four cases combined, from Kansas, South Carolina, Virginia and Delaware — was argued first in the 1952 term and reargued the next. A fifth case, from Washington, DC, was argued separately.
Among other issues, the Court struggled with the meaning of the Fourteenth Amendment, that portion of the Constitution adopted after the Civil War, guaranteeing equal protection of the laws, as well as due process.
In the earliest cases defining the Fourteenth Amendment, the Court had said:
""It ordains that no state shall deprive any person of life, liberty or property without due process of law, or deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws.
""What is this but declaring that the law in the States shall be the same for the black as for the white; that all persons, whether colored or white, shall stand equal before the laws of the States, and, in regard to the colored race, for whose
9
protection the amendment was primarily designed, that no discrimination shall be made against them by law because of their color?""ix
From this hopeful beginning there emerged, only a few years later, the disgraceful doctrine of ""separate but equal"" in Plessy v. Ferguson.x
In ""laboring with the doctrine for over half a century"" before Brown, the Supreme Court examined how ""separate but equal"" applied in a number of contexts, including education. But not until Brown was the continuing validity of the doctrine squarely presented.
In scheduling Brown for re-argument, the Court asked the lawyers to prepare written responses to five questions, two of them dealing with the history of the Fourteenth Amendment and public education. The lawyers turned to historians and constitutional experts, including my father, for assistance.
While C. Vann Woodward and John Hope Franklin were studying post-Reconstruction policies regarding race relations in the South and Alfred Kelley and Howard J. Graham were working on the intent of the framers of the Fourteenth Amendment, my father was researching the intentions of the ratifying states with respect to school segregation.
Some scholars, like Henry Steele Commager, declined to help the NAACP in this work; they believed the facts would not support the NAACP's position. My father, knew, however, that both the historical record and the political goals could be pursued without sacrificing either. In the end, the Court regarded the historical evidence as ""inconclusive"", xi a ""draw"", which may have meant victory for the NAACP. It may have allowed the Court to overcome Plessy's flat statement that Congress condoned segregation. Free to look for guidance elsewhere, the Court was able to
10
speak for what one historian has called ""the American conscience.""xii
Perhaps, having done the right thing by denouncing ""separate but equal"", the Court then felt free to delay the implementation of what it had announced. Whatever the reason, the phrase ""with all deliberate speed"" was added to the lexicon of ignominious judicial pronouncements less than a year after one of the most shameful judicial doctrines had been discarded.
The Court, a year after announcing its decision on the merits, ordered the nation to make haste slowly in desegregating the system of separate and unequal schools. The defendants were required, in a masterpiece of ambiguity, ""to admit to public schools on a racially nondiscriminatory basis with all deliberate speed the parties in these cases.""xiii
For the first ten years after Brown, the emphasis was more on ""deliberate"" than on ""speed."" The focus was on dismantling the dual school systems in the South, the products of de jure segregation, and in southern accents, all deliberate speed meant any conceivable delay. Actual integration was more a legal fiction than fact. President Dwight Eisenhower had lobbied Chief Justice Warren to rule for the Southern states and segregated schools; he never endorsed the Brown decision, and the resistant white South, emboldened by his rectitude, reacted with evasion and delay. Their tactics included violence, expansion of private schools, state support for fleeing white students, proposals to abolish public education, repeal of compulsory attendance laws, and the long discarded theories of interposition and nullification. Prince Edward County, Virginia, simply closed its public schools for five years, believing that uneducated children were preferable to integrated ones. Where massive resistance failed, aggressive resistance succeeded.
By the end of 1964, ten years after Brown, more than 97% of all
11
Southern black children still attended segregated schools. There was far too much deliberation and far too little speed.
When the '64 Civil Rights Act was being debated and finally became law, most in the civil rights community concentrated on the public accommodations section of the Act — on lunch counters and restaurants, and on provisions affecting employment discrimination.
Overlooked, for many, were provisions of the Act dealing with education, and overlooked today is how important the Act could have been in making Brown's promise a reality.
When Congress was debating the 1964 Civil Rights Act, in all of Alabama, only 29 black students attended formerly white schools, only 9 in South Carolina, and none in Mississippi.
The four years following the passage of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 represent the only period in the 50-year-history of Brown when there was active support for desegregation from both the executive branch and the courts.
For the first time, under a southern President, Lyndon Johnson, the Federal government began to take an active role. This period saw the percentage of black children in school with white ones more than quadrupled, rising from 3 to 13%.
But still there were costs. Surrendering to caution, the integration process became a one-way street as a few black students and fewer black teachers and even fewer administrators were admitted to formerly all-white schools. Thousands of black schoolteachers lost their jobs as black and white schools merged. Lost too was history — revered school names, mottoes, mascots, traditions. Plaques, trophy cases, school colors — all the artifacts that honored black achievement disappeared. Black students found
12
themselves in formerly all-white school buildings that retained the character and identity acquired in the segregated past — Booker T. Washington High School vanished, Robert E. Lee High School persevered.
In President Lyndon Johnson's last year in office, the federal government reviewed 28 communities for compliance with desegregation guidelines; in President Richard Nixon's first year, the figure dropped to 16. By the second year it stood at 15; the third year at 11; the fourth year at 9; the first year of his second term at 1, and by the next year, the number dropped to none.
The years 1968-73, however, represent the most active period of Supreme Court intervention on behalf of school desegregation. The court that 13 years earlier had been content to see desegregation proceed ""with all deliberate speed"" ordered segregation removed ""root and branch"" in 1968.xiv
To that end, it permitted busing in 1971.xv
Johnson's commitment to civil rights had sustained enforcement efforts in the South in the face of widespread white opposition. When Republicans captured the White House, the process was politicized, and the principle sanction available to enforce desegregation, cutting off federal funds, was renounced.
Within months of Nixon's election, what was then known as the Department of Health, Education and Welfare (HEW) was under orders to end the threat of funding cut-offs as a prod to integration; enforcement was transferred from HEW to the Department of Justice, which under Attorney General John Mitchell, argued in the Supreme Court for less desegregation, not more, establishing a pattern adopted by the Ford, Reagan, and Bush Administrations.
Nixon's HEW Secretary took the extraordinary steps of writing to the
13
Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals to say that desegregation plans prepared by his own department's experts form Mississippi would cause ""chaos, confusion, and catastrophic educational setbacks.""
The Carter Administration attempted to revive fund cutoff enforcement. Cut-off action was begun in Kansas City. But the only limiting amendment adopted by Congress to the '64 Civil Rights Act was pushed by liberal Democrats Thomas Eagleton of Missouri and Joseph Biden of Delaware, when schools in their home states faced desegregation efforts.
The Reagan Administration launched an attack on school desegregation. They invited school districts to reverse existing desegregation orders and intervened in court cases even where school boards had not requested it. They asked the Supreme Court to authorize tax exemptions for private segregated schools. They settled cases with remedies that had failed elsewhere. They eliminated the major desegregation aid program.
What distinguished the Administrations of Ronald Reagan and George H. W. Bush was their attacks on virtually all components affecting segregation and discrimination in American education.
After passage of the 1964 Civil Rights Act, the first President Bush, then a House member, told his fellow Texans, ""The new Civil Rights Act was passed to protect 14% of the people. I'm worried about the other 86%.""xvi
The percentage of black students at majority white schools in the South went from zero in 1954 to a peak of 43.5 percent in 1988, proving there is nothing wrong with Brown's premise. It is Brown's promise that has been broken — betrayed by a failure of Presidential leadership, defeated by a lack of Congressional oversight and action, ruined by a retreat by the federal bureaucracy charged with enforcement, and crushed by a series of
14
unfavorable court rulings, ranging from the adverse to the hostile.
When William Rehnquist joined the Supreme Court, courtesy of Richard Nixon, all major desegregation cases since Brown had been unanimous. Rehnquist, as a clerk to Justice Jackson during the Brown case, had written a memo arguing that the Court should uphold Plessy v. Ferguson. Then he lied about it at his confirmation hearing. As a Justice himself, Rehnquist cast the first dissenting vote in a post-Brown desegregation case in 1973, setting the stage for what would become a new anti-desegregation majority in the 1990s after he became Chief Justice.
So today we have a Chief Justice who has consistently opposed school desegregation and an Attorney General who built his political career on attacking the efforts of the federal courts to desegregate St. Louis and Kansas City schools. As Missouri's Attorney General and then Governor, John Ashcroft continually attacked the federal courts managing school integration in his state, and when the courts found the state to be ""the primary constitutional violator,"" he fought to limit the state's contribution to the remedy the court imposed.xvii
It is hardly a surprise, then, that when the current state of school integration is examined, discouraging results abound.
If the years since Brown have not succeeded in dismantling segregated schools, those years have seen American preferences for segregated education shrink.xviii
That constitutes modest achievement for black Americans. For us and other minorities, separate has never been equal, not then, not now.
America's history tells us that has always been true.
There are few matters on which experts in any given field agree. Educational experts, however, agree that no school district in America has
15
managed to create equal education on a large scale in segregated schools, be they black or Hispanic schools. This is not to say that one-race schools are never successful. A few are — particularly on the elementary level. But the bottom line is that students who attend schools that are segregated by race and income consistently rank lower in educational achievement, especially at the secondary school level.xix In short, the United States can't afford separate schools.
The educational damage done by racial segregation does not grow from the relationship between blacks and whites alone; it grows from the relationship between blacks and whites and green. In America, the education dollar follows the white child. The students who are most likely to find themselves in schools of concentrated poverty today are not white; they are black and Latino.xx
Compared with poor whites, poor blacks are more likely to live in neighborhoods where a high percentage of the residents are poor. They interact mainly with others who are poor, who share their disadvantage.
They live, squeezed together, in less than standard housing, in neighborhoods denuded of essential services. They shop at stores owned by merchants geared to do business with a poor clientele. Their neighborhoods are economically and racially segregated, bereft of opportunity, out of sight and out of mind.
Their children attend schools only with other poor, minority children. As the New Jersey Supreme Court said, ""They face, through no fault of their own, a life of poverty and isolation that most of us cannot begin to understand and appreciate.""xxi
Fewer dollars in the parents' pockets mean fewer dollars in the school board's treasury. Children in high poverty schools read less, get lower
16
grades, and miss more days of school.xxii
Economic and racial integration are preconditions for equal opportunity. Once achieved, they permanently alter the pattern of minority-majority relationships.
In cities where school integration exists, it is not only the most visible form of desegregation, but the only one that impacts personally on the lives of millions of whites.xxiii This is why many whites have so strongly resisted it; it is also why blacks and other minorities must continue to insist upon it.
I recently heard Minnie Jean Brown reflect on her experiences as one of the heroic Little Rock Nine who integrated Central High School in 1957. Someone asked why she kept coming back to school day after day, despite the daily harassment and intimidation that would have driven most people away.
From the ferocity of her enemies, she said, ""I knew there was something precious inside that school,"" and she was more determined to get it than they were to keep it from her grasp.
There are those who scoff at Brown as if the advantages to black children were to be gained simply by sitting next to white ones in a classroom, as if a skin-to-skin transfer of knowledge and education could occur. These critics miss the point of integrated schools.
They are, as one expert said, ""truly radical.""xxiv A public educational system that is fully integrated and treats minorities and whites equally, is the antithesis of the larger society, which is profoundly segregated and unequal. The goal of putting minorities and whites in the same classrooms is not only to equalize education, but also to change the formative racial experiences of the next generation.
Today minority children face inequalities in school spending, and more — they face what Jonathan Kozol calls ""punitive testing and accountability
17
agendas"" imposed by the No Child Left Behind Act. Schools have adopted a ""grill and drill curriculum"" that substitutes learning by rote and teaching to the test for the transmission of critical thinking from teacher to pupil.xxv
Our schools present two faces to American society. In one, they are our most important democratic institution, pathways to class mobility and generational progress, and their success or failure impacts the lives and prospects of millions of families and children every day.
The other face is an instrument for reproducing the class and race privilege of the larger society, reinforcing the very inequality they are designed to overcome.xxxi
On our present course, we are formalizing two school systems: one filled with middle class children, most of them white, and one filled with low-income minorities. For too many, the latter schools have become a conveyor belt to prison.
Our future as a nation depends on our willingness to continue to reach into the racial cleavage that define American society and change the racial contours of our world.
In 1954, the Federal government's brief in Brown argued that school desegregation was a Cold War imperative, a necessary weapon to win America's battles overseas. Current events give us the same imperative — to prove to enemy and ally alike that our commitment to justice is sincere.
School segregation and unequal education are issues everywhere — issues here in the commonwealth of Virginia.
African-American students are less than a third of the public school population here, but exactly half of all students suspended, and one-third of those in special education. White students here are 10 times more likely than African-Americans to be placed in gifted and talented programs. White
18
students here outperform African-Americans by 20 percentage points in reading and math. Virginia spends twice as much money to keep her citizens in jail for a year than it costs to send a student to the University of Virginia.xxvii
What, then, is to be done? Do we continue to slide backward toward Plessy and segregation, or can we make Brown's promise at last come true? The brave Americans who fought and won Brown fifty years ago faced obstacles we cannot imagine and had few resources and little public support with which to do the job. We can do no less.
This fall, we have the opportunity to elect a pro-Brown president and Congress that will appoint judges and enforcement officials who understand the Supreme Court was right then and that the job is far from over.
We can revive the federal aid program of the Nixon and Carter Administrations that helped multiracial schools deal positively with issues of race relations, multicultural curricula, and more effective classroom operation.
We can recruit young people, especially young people of color, into the education profession, and insure they receive full and fair employment opportunities from all school districts, not just minority schools.
We can mount a real fight against housing segregation, and insure minority parents and their children have access to middle class schools. We can use choice programs — public magnet and charter schools — if they are enacted in a strict pro-integration mode, forbidding transfers that increase segregation and rewarding those that diminish it.
We can amend the No Child Left Behind Act and provide financial incentives and positive recognition to segregated suburbs that accept significant numbers of minority students from failing schools.xxviii

When my grandfather graduated from Berea, he was asked to deliver the commencement address. He said then:
""The pessimist from his corner looks out upon the world of wickedness and sin, and blinded to all that is good or hopeful in the condition and progress of the human race, bewails the present state of affairs and predicts woeful things for the future.""
""In every cloud he beholds a destructive storm, in every flash of lightning an omen for evil and in every shadow that falls across his path a lurking foe.""
""He forgets that clouds also bring life and hope, that the lightning purifies the atmosphere, that shadow and darkness prepare for sunshine and growth, and that hardships and adversity nerve the race, as the individual, for greater efforts and grander victories.xxix

""Greater efforts and grander victories."" That was the promise made by the generation born in slavery a century and a half ago. That was the promise made by the generation that won the great World War for democracy six decades ago. That was the promise made by the generation that brought democracy to America's darkest corners four decades ago, and that is the promise we must all seek to honor today.

We are here to announce, ""The race is on! The gloves are off! We are in a fight for our lives, and we are here to commit to winning it!""
It is fitting that we commit ourselves to this fight for democracy in the city where our democracy was born.
This is also the place where, more than a hundred years ago, one of our founders, Dr. W. E. B. DuBois, conducted his landmark study that became The Philadelphia Negro, published in 1899.
Invited by the University of Pennsylvania to research ""the Negro problem,"" DuBois wrote candidly of black behavioral problems and of ""a spirit of self-help,""i exhorting,
""Against prejudice, injustice and wrong the Negro ought to protest energetically and continuously, but he must never forget that he protests because those things hinder his
3
own efforts, and that those efforts are the key to his future.""ii
[The typed page numbers omit 2; the editors do not believe any content is missing.]
In the spirit of DuBois, the NAACP is today one of the largest self-help groups in the country. It is no accident that, for 95 years, we've led the way in taking personal responsibility for making right America's wrongs.
DuBois understood, as do we, that poverty's symptoms must not be confused with poverty's causes. He said:
""(M)en have a right to object to a race so poor and ignorant and inefficient as the mass of Negroes; but if their policy in the past is the parent of much of this condition, and if today by shutting black boys and girls out of most avenues of decent employment they are increasing pauperism and vice, then they must hold themselves largely responsible for the deplorable results.""iii

DuBois arrived here in Philadelphia in 1896, the same year the United States Supreme Court ratified separate and unequal lives for black and white Americans in Plessy v. Ferguson.
We meet 50 years after the Court overruled Plessy and unanimously declared, in Brown v. Board of Education, that segregated schools violate the Constitution's promise of equal protection.
There can be no mistake — those fifty years since Brown have seen the fortunes of black America advance and retreat, but the decision is always cause for sober celebration, not impotent dismay.
We celebrate the brilliant legal minds who were architects of Brown v. Board; we celebrated the brave families who were its plaintiffs; and we celebrate the legal principle that remains its enduring legacy — that, in the words of Chief Justice Earl Warren, ""the doctrine of
4
separate but equal has no place.""iv
That the quest for meaningful equality — political and economic equity — remains unfulfilled today is no indictment of past efforts. It is testament to the challenge before us.
As we commemorate the 50th anniversary of that landmark decision, it is easy to cast a cynical eye on the status of school desegregation in America today — or the sorry state of race relations — and minimize the significance of Brown. That is a grave mistake, for Brown, by destroying segregation's legality, gave a nonviolent army the power to destroy segregation's morality as well.
Thus it is no coincidence that this year we also celebrate the 40th anniversary of the passage of the 1964 Civil Rights Act — the most sweeping civil rights legislation before or since, and our democracy's finest hour.
When he sent what would become the 1964 Civil Rights Act to Congress, President John F. Kennedy said:
""When Americans are sent to Viet Nam or West Berlin, we do not ask for whites only.""

Today, when Americans are being sent to Afghanistan and Iraq, we do not ask for whites only.
So this convention, as we commemorate these anniversaries, is a time to examine our present in relation to our past. And as we prepare for national elections this fall, this convention will be a time for an examination of our present in relation to our future.
We look back on the years between Brown and the passage of the 1964 Civil Rights Act with some pride.
5
In those years, Brown's anniversary became a celebratory signpost, as major events focused on commemorating the date.
The year after Brown, Rosa Parks sat down to stand up for her rights, and the Montgomery bus boycott began.
Martin Luther King's first national address was at a 1957 Prayer Pilgramage on the third anniversary of Brown at the Lincoln Memorial.
Later that same year the Little Rock Nine successfully integrated Little Rock's Central High School.
Sit-ins at segregated lunch counters burst out across the South in 1960, followed by the Freedom Rides of 1961 and the forcible integration of Ole Miss in 1962.
In 1963 alone, the year that King — fresh from the battlefields of Birmingham — told the nation of his dream at the March on Washington, there were more than 10,000 anti-racist demonstrations.
King was the most famous and well known of the modern movement's personalities, but it was a people's movement. It produced leaders of its own; but it relied not on the noted but the nameless, not on the famous, but the faceless. It didn't wait for commands from afar to begin a campaign against injustice. It saw wrong, and it acted against it.
Those were the days when women and men of all races and creeds worked together in the cause of civil rights.
Those were the days when good music was popular and popular music was good.
Those were the days when the President picked the Supreme Court and not the other way around.
6
Those were the days when we had a war on poverty, not a war on the poor. Those were the days when patriotism was a reason for open-eyed disobedience, not an excuse for blind allegiance.
Those were the days when the news media really was ""fair and balanced"" and not just cheerleaders for the powerful.
But those were not ""the good old days.""
Then, the American social order was rigidly stratified and racially codified.
In those days, ""(t)he law, the courts, the schools, and almost every institution ... favored whites. This was white supremacy.""v
This was a massive system of racial preferences, enforced by law and terror. It began with slave-catching in Africa, and it continues on to the present day.
Only when we acknowledge the name, nature and scope of the problem can we measure the magnitude of our successes — and the costs of our failures.
The day Brown was decided, the NAACP held a news conference to announce an ambitious new agenda. To Thurgood Marshall, Brown was the Magna Carta of black America, a declaration of our rights. School segregation would be eliminated, he thought, within five years. He was right about the former; he was obviously wrong about the latter.
Within a year, in Brown II, the Supreme Court allowed desegregation to proceed ""with all deliberate speed."" For the first time, the Court had declared a right and delayed its implementation.
Three months after Brown II, Emmett Till, who was nearly my age, was murdered in Money, Mississippi, for whistling at a white woman. His death and the black newspapers that came into my
7
Pennsylvania home created a great vulnerability and fear of all things southern in my teenaged mind. When my parents announced in 1957 that we were relocating to Atlanta, I was filled with dread.
Emmett Till's death had frightened me. But in the fall of 1957 a group of black teenagers encouraged me to put that fear aside. These young people — the nine young women and men who integrated Central High School in Little Rock, Arkansas — set a high standard of grace and courage under fire as they dared the mobs who surrounded their school.
Here, I thought, is what I hope I can be, if ever the chance comes my way.
The chance to test and prove myself did come my way in 1960, as it came to thousands of other black high school and college students across the South. First through the sit-ins, then in Freedom Rides, and then in the voter registration and political organizing drives in the rural South, we joined an old movement against white supremacy that had deep, strong roots; for many of us, however, it was the recent Brown decision that had created the opportunity for young people to play active roles, to seize and share leadership in the movement for social justice.
Brown was the movement's greatest legal victory. It changed the legal status of black Americans, and ironically made challenges to the established movement's narrow reliance on legal action possible.
As Richard Kluger has written:
""Not until the Supreme Court acted in 1954 did the nation acknowledge it had been blaming the black man for what it had done to him. His sentence to second class citizenship had been commuted; the quest for meaningful equality — equality in fact as well as in law — had begun.""vi

8
I believe in an integrated America — integrated jobs, homes and schools. I believe in it enough to have spent most of my life in its elusive pursuit. I think it is a legal, moral, and political imperative for America — a matter of elemental justice, simple right waged against historical wrong.
Brown was about black inequality, what Lyndon Johnson called ""the one huge wrong of the American nation.""vii
""The Supreme Court said nothing about Latinos nineteen years after Brown and there never was any significant enforcement of desegregation for Latinos.""viii
Today, ""U.S. schools are becoming more segregated in all regions for both African-American and Latino students.""ix
By contrast, Asian students are most integrated.x
I not only have spent most of my life in the cause of integration, in 1947 — when I was seven years old — I was plaintiff in a lawsuit in rural Pennsylvania against segregated schools.
It never came to trial. The school board had segregated schools by giving students achievement tests which all blacks failed and all whites passed, but when the two dumb sons of the local white political boss failed the test, they closed the black school, and all of Lincoln University Village's children went to a one-room school together.
This year I visited Berea College in Kentucky, opened by abolitionists as an integrated school in 1855. It was closed by the Civil War, but opened again in 1866 with 187 students — 96 blacks, and 91 whites. It dared to provide a rare commodity in the former slave states: an education open to all — blacks and whites, women and men.
9
One of those early students was my grandfather.
Like many others, I am the grandson of a slave. My grandfather was born in 1863, in Kentucky; freedom didn't come for him until the 13th Amendment was ratified in 1865.
He and his mother were property, like a horse or a chair. As a young girl, she had been given away as a wedding present to a new bride, and when that bride became pregnant, her husband — that's my great-grandmother's owner and master — exercised his right to take his wife's slave as his mistress.
That union produced two children, one of them my grandfather.
At age 15, barely able to read and write, he hitched his tuition — a steer — to a rope and walked across Kentucky to Berea College and the college took him in.
Today, some call us pessimists. How dare they? We are the ones who believed in the American dream even while we lived a nightmare. We not only believed in it, we fought for it. Many died for it. They ought to call us patriots.
When my grandfather graduated from Berea, he was asked to deliver the commencement address. He said then:
""The pessimist from his corner looks out upon the world of wickedness and sin, and blinded to all that is good or hopeful in the condition and progress of the human race, bewails the present state of affairs and predicts woeful things for the future.""
""In every cloud he beholds a destructive storm, in every flash of lightening an omen of evil and in every shadow that falls across his path a lurking foe.""
""He forgets that the clouds also bring life and hope, that the lightening purifies the atmosphere, that shadow and darkness prepare for sunshine and growth, and that
10
hardships and adversity nerve the race, as the individual, for greater efforts and grander victories.xi
Greater efforts and grander victories — that is the promise we expect to fulfill at the ballot box this fall.
My grandfather belonged to a transcendent generation of black Americans, a generation freed from servitude by the Civil War, a generation determined to make their way as free women and men. From Berea, he studied for the ministry, married, and had six children — one of them my father, Horace Mann Bond.
My father graduated from Pennsylvania's Lincoln University and earned a doctorate in education from the University of Chicago. For him, too, education was a means to a larger end — the uplift of his people and the salvation of his race.
How fitting, then, that he would be asked to help the NAACP in its legal campaign against school segregation — the campaign that culminated in Brown v. Board of Education.
Perhaps, having done the right thing by denouncing ""separate but equal"", the Court then felt free to delay the implementation of what it had announced. Whatever the reason, the phrase ""with all deliberate speed"" was added to the lexicon of ignominious judicial pronouncements less than a year after one of the most shameful judicial doctrines had been discarded.
For the first ten years after Brown, the emphasis was more on ""deliberate"" than on ""speed."" The focus was on dismantling the dual school systems in the South, the products of de jure segregation, and in
11
southern accents, all deliberate speed meant any conceivable delay. President Eisenhower had lobbied Chief Justice Warren to rule for the Southern states and segregate schools; he never endorsed the Brown decision, and the resistant white South, emboldened by his rectitude, reacted with evasion and delay. Their tactics included violence, expansion of private schools, state support for fleeing white students, proposals to abolish public education, repeal of compulsory attendance laws, and the long discarded theories of interposition and nullification. Prince Edward County, Virginia, simply closed its public schools for five years, believing that uneducated children were preferable to integrated ones. Where massive resistance failed, aggressive resistance succeeded.
By the end of 1964, ten years after Brown, more than 97% of all Southern black children still attend segregated schools. There was far too much deliberation and far too little speed.
When Congress was debating the 1964 Civil Rights Act, in all of Alabama, only 29 black students attended formerly white schools, only 9 in South Carolina, and none in Mississippi.
The four years following the passage of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 represent the only period in the 50-year-history of Brown when there was active support for desegregation from both the executive branch and the courts.
For the first time, under a southern President, Lyndon Johnson, the Federal government began to take an active role. This period saw the percentage of black children in school with white ones more than quadruple, rising from 3 to 13%.
But still there were costs. Surrendering to caution, the integration
12
process became a one-way street as a few black students and fewer black teachers and even fewer administrators were admitted to formerly all-white schools. Thousands of black schoolteachers lost their jobs as black and white schools merged. Lost too was history — revered school names, mottoes, traditions. Plaques, trophy cases, school colors — all the artifacts that honored black achievement disappeared. Black students found themselves in formerly all-white school buildings that retained the character and identity acquired in the segregated past — Booker T. Washington High School vanished; Robert E. Lee High School persevered.
In President Lyndon Johnson's last year in office, the federal government reviewed 28 communities for compliance with desegregation guidelines; by President Richard Nixon's second term the number had dropped to none.
The years 1968-73, however, represent the most active period of Supreme Court intervention on behalf of school desegregation. The Court that 13 years earlier had been content to see segregation proceed ""with all deliberate speed"" ordered segregation removed ""root and branch"" in 1968.
To that end, it allowed busing in 1971.
Jonson's commitment to civil rights had sustained enforcement efforts in the South in the face of widespread white opposition. When Republicans captured the White House, the process was politicized, and the principle sanction available to enforce desegregation, cutting off federal funds, was renounced.
The Carter Administration attempted to revive fund cutoff enforcement. Cut-off action was begun in Kansas City. But the only
13
limiting amendment adopted by Congress to the '64 Civil Rights Act was pushed by liberal Democrats Thomas Eagleton of Missouri and Joseph Biden of Delaware, when schools in their home states faced desegregation efforts.
The Reagan Administration launched an attack on school desegregation. They invited school districts to reverse existing school desegregation orders and intervened in court cases even where school boards had not requested it. They asked the Supreme Court to authorize tax exemptions for private segregated schools. They settled cases with remedies that had failed elsewhere. They eliminated the major desegregation aid program.
What distinguished the Administrations of Ronald Reagan and George H. W. Bush was their attacks on virtually all components affecting segregation and discrimination in American education.
After passage of the 1964 Civil Rights Act, the first President Bush, then a House member, told his fellow Texans, ""The new Civil Rights Act was passed to protect 14% of the people. I'm worried about the other 86%.""
The percentage of black students at majority white schools in the South went from zero in 1954 to a peak of 43.5 percent in 1988, proving there is nothing wrong with Brown's premise. It is Brown's promise that has been broken — betrayed by a failure of Presidential leadership, by a lack of Congressional oversight and action, by a retreat by the federal bureaucracy charged with enforcement, and by a series of unfavorable court rulings.
When William Rehnquist joined the Supreme Court, courtesy of Richard Nixon, all major desegregation cases since Brown had been
14
unanimous. Rehnquist, as a clerk to Justice Jackson during the Brown case, had written a memo arguing that the Court should uphold Plessy v. Ferguson. Then he lied about it at his confirmation hearing. As a Justice himself, Rehnquist cast the first dissenting vote in a post-Brown desegregation case in 1973, setting the stage for what would become a new anti-desegregation majority in the 1990s after he became Chief Justice.
So today we have a Chief Justice who has consistently opposed school desegregation and an Attorney General who built his political career on lambasting the efforts of the federal courts to desegregate St. Louis and Kansas City schools. As Missouri's Attorney General and then Governor, John Ashcroft continually attacked the federal courts managing school integration in his state and, when the courts found the state to be ""the primary constitutional violator,"" he fought to limit the state's contribution to the remedy the court imposed.xv
It is hardly a surprise, then, that when the current state of school integration is examined, discouraging results abound.
If the years since Brown have not succeeded in dismantling segregated schools, those years have seen American support for segregated education shrink.xvi
That is modest achievement for black Americans. For us and other minorities, separate has never been equal, not then, not now.
America's history tells us that has always been true.
There are few matters on which experts in a given field agree. Educational experts, however, agree that no school district in America has managed to create equal education on a large scale in segregated schools, be they black or Hispanic. This is not to say that one-race
15
schools are never successful. A few are — particularly on the elementary level. But the bottom line is that students who attend schools that are segregated by race and income consistently rank lower in educational achievement, especially at the secondary school level.xvii In short, the United States can't afford separate schools.
The educational damage done by racial segregation does not grow from the relationship between blacks and whites alone; it grows from the relationship between blacks and whites and green. In America, the education dollar follows the white child. The students who are most likely to find themselves in schools of concentrated poverty today are not white; they are black and Latino.xviii
Compared with poor whites, poor blacks are more likely to live in neighborhoods where a high percentage of the residents are poor. They interact mainly with others who are poor, who share their disadvantage.
They live, squeezed together, in less than standard housing, in neighborhoods denuded of essential services. Their neighborhoods are economically and racially segregated, bereft of opportunity, out of sight and out of mind.
Their children attend schools only with other poor, minority children. As the New Jersey Supreme Court said, ""They face, through no fault of their own, a life of poverty and isolation that most of us cannot begin to understand and appreciate.""xix
Fewer dollars in the parents' pockets mean fewer dollars in the school board's treasury. Children in high poverty schools read less, get lower grades, and miss more days of school.xx
Economic and racial integration are preconditions for equal opportunity. Once achieved, they permanently alter the pattern of
16
minority-majority relationships.
In cities where school integration exists, it is not only the most visible form of desegregation, but the only one that impacts personally on the lives of millions of whites. xxi This is why many whites have so strongly resisted it; it is also why blacks and other minorities must continue to insist upon it.
I recently heard Minnie Jean Brown reflect on her experiences as one of the heroic Little Rock Nine who integrated Central High School in 1957. Someone asked why she kept coming back to school day after day, despite daily harassment and intimidation that would have driven most people away.
From the ferocity of her enemies, she said, ""I knew there was something precious inside that school,"" and she was even more determined to get it than they were to keep it from her grasp.
There are those who scoff at Brown as if the advantages to black children were to be gained simply by sitting next to white ones in a classroom, as if skin-to-skin transfer of knowledge and education could occur. These critics miss the point of integrated schools.
Integrated schools are, as one expert said, ""truly radical.""xxii A public educational system that is fully integrated and treats minorities and whites equally, is the antithesis of the larger society, which is profoundly segregated and unequal. The goal of putting minorities and whites in the same classrooms is not only to equalize education, but also to change the formative racial experiences of the next generation.
Today minority children face inequalities in school spending, and more — they face what Jonathan Kozol calls ""punitive testing and accountability agendas"" imposed by the No Child Left Behind Act.

Schools have adopted a ""grill and drill curriculum"" that substitutes learning by rote and teaching to the test for the transmission of critical thinking from teacher to pupil.xxiii
On our present course, we are formalizing two school systems: one filled with middle class children, most of them white, and one filled with low-income minorities. For too many, the latter schools have become conveyor belts to prison.
There were an estimated 98,000 blacks imprisoned on the day Brown was decided in 1954. Today there are 884,500. More than half of black men in their early 30s who are high school dropouts also have a prison record.
Here in Pennsylvania, 2 in 3 black fifth graders do not read on grade level, compared to 1 in 3 whites. Four in 5 black eighth graders do not do math on grade level, compared to 2 in 5 of their white counterparts.
Not surprisingly, there is a graduation gap, too. Three in 10 blacks from Pennsylvania's high school class of 2002 did not graduate, compared to only 1 in 10 whites.
Pennsylvania spends more than $27,000 annually per prison inmate. That's more than twice the cost of a year's tuition at Pennsylvania State University.
Our future as a nation depends on our willingness to continue to reach into the racial cleavage that defines American society and change the racial contours of our world. In 1954, the Federal government's brief in Brown argued that school desegregation was a cold war imperative, a necessary weapon to win America's battles overseas. Current events give us the same imperative — to prove to enemy and ally
18
alike that our commitment to justice is sincere.
We meet while an unwise war of occupation continues in Iraq, a war without reason or necessity. It was not about weapons of mass destruction, but rather the crass obstruction of the truth.
Now the war has created the very terrorist training camp in Iraq its sponsors said was its cause.
The war's defenders have tried to stifle political debate — if you oppose the war, they say, you don't support our troops.
That's nonsense. If it was up to us, every man and woman stationed in Iraq would be safely at home right now.
When Martin Luther King spoke out against the war in Vietnam in 1965, he was revolted at the hypocrisy of America's claims for freedom overseas when blacks enjoyed few freedoms here. War abroad, King said, stole from Americans at home.
""The pursuit of widened war,"" he said in 1966, ""has narrowed domestic welfare programs, making the poor, white and Negro, bear the heaviest burdens at the front and at home.""
How sadly true those words ring today.
The NAACP has always been non-partisan, but that doesn't mean we're non-critical. For as long as we've existed, whether Democrats or Republicans have occupied the White House, we've spoken truth to power.
When his friends asked Harry Truman, ""Mr. President, why do you give the other side so much hell?"" Truman said, ""I just tell the truth and they think it's hell!"" When any political party places politics over principle, we're going to give them non-partisan hell!
19
When we were founded in 1909, Theodore Roosevelt was ending his second term. He shared traits with many of today's Negrophobes — he liked individual African-Americans but believed the mass were less than human.
His successor, William Howard Taft, said his ""little brown brothers"" — that's us — would need ""fifty to 100 years"" to become equal with whites.
Woodrow Wilson, who institutionalized segregation in the federal bureaucracy, succeeded Taft. The NAACP's James Weldon Johnson said of him, ""My distrust and dislike ... came nearer to constituting keen hatred for an individual than anything I have ever felt.""
Warren Harding, who followed, joked with Johnson about the rumor Harding had African-American blood; where have we heard that before? Whatever kind of blood he had, Harding had neither the heart nor courage to right the wrongs that afflicted people of color.
NAACP Executive Secretary Walter White was prescient in the Calvin Coolidge years when he said, ""The Republicans will absorb the anti-Negro south and become ... the relatively anti-Negro party, while the Negro will find refuge in the Democratic Party.""
White said the next President, Herbert Hoover, showed nothing ""to indicate he regarded Negroes as citizens and human beings.""
Franklin Roosevelt served almost four terms. By the time he died in 1945 his economic policies and the personality and politics of first lady Eleanor Roosevelt had hastened black conversion to the Democratic Party.
Harry Truman became the first President to speak to an NAACP audience.
20
The next President, Dwight Eisenhower, told ""nigger jokes"" in the White House. But he made some black appointments, and his reward was 60% of the black vote against Adlai Stevenson in 1956, temporarily reversing the black slide to the Democrats that Franklin Roosevelt had begun.
John F. Kennedy's 1960 campaign reversed the Eisenhower shift toward Republicans when he pledged to eliminate housing segregation ""with the stroke of a pen"" and when he made a famous telephone call — ignored in the mainstream press — to the wife of the jailed Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.
An assassin's bullet brought Lyndon Johnson to office — and he pursued civil rights as had no president before him and no president since. The Civil Rights Act of 1964 and the Voting Rights Act of 1965 are part of his legacy.
But the passage of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and the Voting Rights Act of 1965 marked the beginning of the dependence of the Republican Party on the politics of racial division to win elections and gain power. By playing the race card in election after election, they've appealed to the dark underside of American culture, to the minority of Americans who reject democracy and equality.
They preach racial neutrality and practice racial division. Apparently they really do think we all look alike — to hear them, Martin Luther King and Clarence Thomas are the same man.
They've tried to patch the leaky economy — and every other domestic problem — with duct tape and plastic sheets.
They write a new Constitution for Iraq and ignore the Constitution here at home.
21
They say giving health care to all Iraqis is sound policy; they say giving health care to all Americans is socialism.
If a president lies about having an affair, they say ""Impeach him!"" If a president lies about going to war, the say ""Re-elect him!""
If you're a drug addict on the street, they say it's a crime, but if you're a right wing radio talk show host, they say it's an illness.
They use our troops for photo ops while cutting veterans' benefits and combat pay.
They operate a perpetual motion attack machine and squeal like pigs if you answer back.
Overdosed on testosterone, they've descended into the very vulgarity they say they want to keep off the airwaves.
They believe in the politics of fear; we believe in the politics of hope.
Now they want to write bigotry back into the Constitution; they want to make one group of Americans outsiders to our common heritage. They want to do what has never been done before — to amend the Constitution to create a group of second-class citizens. Our Constitution is the last hope of freedom; it cannot become a carrier of prejudice and intolerance.
And what about the opposition party? Too often they're not an opposition; they're an amen corner.
With some notable exceptions, they have been absent without leave from this battle for America's soul.
When one party is shameless, the other party cannot afford to be spineless.
22
Our economic imbalances not only mean difficult times for many, they also undermine democratic values. The danger is that plutocracy will prevail over democracy, and the free market will rule over the free citizen.
The reason for the current deficit and the varnished surplus can be placed squarely on the tax giveaways to the rich.
To make up for just the initial tax cuts, we would have to cut spending by $5 billion dollars 5 days a week for over a year. That was the whole point — to further enrich the already wealthy and to starve the government, making it unable to meet human needs, signing a death warrant for social programs for decades to come.
War and fear often cause hasty mistakes, costly both in economic and human terms. We need to remember what we are fighting for.
As Justice Sandra Day O'Connor wrote just two weeks ago in the case of ""enemy combatant"" Yaser El Hamdi:
""It is during our most challenging and uncertain moments that our Nation's commitment to due process is most severely tested; and it is in those times that we must preserve our commitment at home to the principles for which we fight abroad.""

We ought to remember the words of President Theodore Roosevelt, who said in 1918,
""To announce there must be no criticism of the President, or to stand by the President, right or wrong, is not only unpatriotic and servile, but is morally treasonous to the American public.""

And the words of Ohio Senator Robert Taft, who said two weeks after Pearl Harbor had been attacked:
23
""I believe there can be no doubt that criticism in time of war is essential to the maintenance of any kind of democratic government.""

And the words of the United States Supreme Court two weeks ago: ""A state of war is not a blank check for the President.""
President Bush chose Martin Luther King's birthday last year to announce that, even though he admitted society continues to do something special against racial minorities,xxiv his administration would not do anything special for them; he opposed the University of Michigan's efforts to promote diversity among its student body.
Bush chose Martin Luther King's birthday this year to unilaterally elevate Charles Pickering to the federal bench — in the face of Pickering's hostility to civil rights and leniency to cross burners.
I was afraid to listen to Bush's speech at the Brown commemoration in Topeka two months ago — afraid he'd announce he was going to repeal the 14th Amendment.
The election this fall is a contest between two widely disparate views of who we are and what we believe. One view wants to march us backward through history — surrendering control of government to special interests, weakening democracy, giving religion veto power over science, curtailing civil liberties, despoiling the environment.
The other view promises expanded democracy and giving the people, not plutocrats, control over their government.
John Kerry accepted our invitation to speak at this convention; President Bush did not. Two days ago, President Bush made his 30th visit to Pennsylvania, his most visited state outside his home territory of Texas, Virginia, and Maryland. Yet he couldn't come to Pennsylvania to
24
speak to us. No doubt he thinks he'll take care of colored people by speaking only to our sister organization, the National Urban League.
Of course, Vice President Cheney is having trouble speaking at all — they're still washing his mouth out with soap. He is now known as ""the Veep of bleep!""
The differences between the candidates this year are neither incremental nor inconsequential.
Yes — the stakes are high, higher than ever in recent memory, and the consequences of loss almost too dire to bear. Fortunately, the race is on!
African-Americans are our nation's largest racial minority, and will remain so for years to come. Their centrality to victory in 2004 cannot be overlooked or left to last-minute afterthoughts or early November drive-by politics.
We must insure every citizen registers and votes. So far, the NAACP and the NAACP National Voter Fund together have registered 100,000 voters in 11 key states.
Let me give some examples of what Reverend Nelson Rivers might call ""the big dogs"" among NAACP Branches.
These will be just the thousandaires. These figures may not be up to-date, but they set an example for us all.
2.494 registered by the Las Vegas Branch. 1.947 in Reno. 6,333 in Detroit. 1,000 by the College Chapter of Alabama A & M. 5,400 in Tallahassee. 4,393 at Volusia County/Daytona Beach. 1,079 in Cincinnati.
2,398 in Columbus, Georgia. 3,083 in Savannah. 2,977 in Atlanta.
1,444 in Charlotte-Mecklenburg. 4,765 in Wendell-Wake.
25
4,323 in Spartanburg. 1,200 in Jackson, Mississippi. 1,514 in Grambling, Louisiana. 3,429 in Houston. 2,834 in Dallas. 1,500 in San Antonio. 1,200 in Huntsville.
4,405 in Albuquerque.
18,046 in Memphis, Tennessee.
Any NAACP Branch that isn't registering voters ought to turn in its charter.
All history is worth remembering; not all history is worth repeating. We must guarantee the irregularities, suppression, nullification, and outright theft of black votes that happened on Election Day 2000 never, ever happen again.
There's a poignant scene in Michael Moore's extraordinary movie, ""Farenheit 9/11."" It takes place on the January day in 2001 when the combined House and Senate have met to certify the winner of the Electoral College vote. Vice President Al Gore is presiding. One by one, members of the Congressional Black Caucus come to the well of the House to ask for an investigation of the stolen and suppressed votes in Florida, and to each, Vice President Gore asks a question, ""Has a member of the Senate signed?""
And one by one the Black Caucus members say, ""No.""
No member of the United States Senate would sign a petition to investigate the larceny that took place in Florida.
Election 2000 confirmed our deep national divisions. Not only did Al Gore receive 90% of the black vote and George W. Bush a majority of the white vote, whites made up 95 percent of Bush's total votes.
Although 57 percent of voters with incomes under $15,000 voted for Gore, even poor whites cast a majority of their votes for Bush.
26
Similarly, 54 percent of women voted for Gore, but white women slightly favored Bush. In politics, as in life, race trumps class and race trumps gender.
The election revelated a cultural, as well as a racial divide. Gore won every major city and almost all suburbs, while Bush took every small town on a straight line from Redding, California to Springfield, Illinois — giving new meaning to Woody Guthrie's old song — ""This Land Is Your Land, This Land Is My Land.""
The only demographic groups that cast a unified vote were blacks, Latinos, Jews, union members, and residents of large cities — all of whom voted 60 percent or more for Gore, and white males, who voted 60 percent for Bush.
Having voted along racial lines, not surprisingly blacks and whites were also divided in the post-election fight, with blacks far more alienated from the process and the results.
The NAACP's unprecedented voter registration and education drive four years ago was an unparalleled success. Two million more black voters cast ballots in 2000 than in 1996.
The African-American share of the total vote increased 25 percent or more in four states, but we know that the black share of the vote could have been higher — and the consequences could not have been greater.
I'll say it again — any Branch in the Association that is not registering voters ought to turn in its charter.
The sorry story of voter suppression and nullification in Florida was told by witness after witness at NAACP hearings after the 2000 election. They described police stops near polling places, racially
27
motivated voter purges, demands for multiple forms of identification from persons who had voted for decades, long-time voters’ names missing from the rolls, and other examples of black votes not being cast and not being counted.
What isn’t as well known is these tactics were not limited to Florida, and weren’t restricted to black precincts. Other minority voters elsewhere in the country suffered as well. We can expect more of the same this year.
Florida already is at it again. We’ve had to ask the Attorney General of the United States to stop Florida from using another soiled list on Election Day. And that may be like asking the fox to guard the chicken coop.
Our response to these tactics must not be cynicism and despair. If you don’t vote because you fear your vote won’t count, you’re absolutely right – if you don’t vote, you won’t count! You’ll be letting the bad guys win. Our response must be determination – to flood the polls and cast our votes in such large numbers that there will be no doubt. That’s letting the good guys win.
Any long-suffering Red Sox fan ought to know – your team won’t win if you don’t touch the base – or if you run too far outside the base path.
The race is on!
You cannot win this race by ignoring race.
We know that if whites and non-whites vote in the same percentages as they did in 2000, Bush will be re-defeated by 3 million votes.
28
And we know that blacks are increasingly angry about the economy and the war. The nation has lost more than 2.5 million jobs in the last three years. The black unemployment rate is double that for whites. A recent poll in six key states – here and in Ohio, Missouri, Florida, Michigan, and Nevada – found that 73 percent of blacks believe Iraq was not worth fighting for and a whopping 77 percent believe that Bush intentionally mislead the nation about the war.
These are voters ready to turn anger into action, to work for regime change here at home. But they have to be asked. They have to be registered, organized, and mobilized. That job must be done by our existing grassroots organizations. We have a track record and we have earned our community’s trust.
I told you about my grandfather a few minutes ago. Let me tell you about my father-in-law, Ernie Horowitz, as I close. These two men were very different – and so much alike.
Their families came here from foreign lands, one seeking freedom, the other in slavery’s chains.
Both faced irrational prejudice; one because of his religion, the other because of his race.
My father-in-law grew up as poor as poor can be. When World War II began, he was the first man in Minnesota called for the draft. He landed on Utah Beach in Normandy two days after D-Day, and several days after that, was shot by a German sniper. That ended his war, but it didn’t end his life. He became a successful restaurateur, and we buried him with military honors on June 9th.
What unites these two men the most is that, like most of us, they worshiped at the altar of the American ideal, believing deeply in
29
participatory democracy. They were determined, in the words of the poet Langston Hughes, as are we, to:
""Let America be America again.
Let it be the dream it used to be.
Let it be the pioneer on the plain,
Seeking a home where he himself is free.
O, let my land be a land where liberty
Is crowned with no false patriotic wreath,
But opportunity is real, and life is free,
Equality is in the air we breathe.
O, yes,
I say it plain,
American never was America to me,
And yet I swear this oath —
America will be!""

This is also the place where, more than a hundred years ago, one of our founders, Dr. W. E. B. DuBois, conducted his landmark study that became The Philadelphia Negro, published in 1899.
Invited by the University of Pennsylvania to research ""the Negro problem,"" DuBois wrote candidly of black behavioral problems and of ""a spirit of self-help""i exhorting,
""Against prejudice, injustice and wrong the Negro ought to protest energetically and continuously, but he must never forget that he protests because those things hinder his own efforts, and that those efforts are the key to his future.""ii

3
[The typed page numbers omit 2; the editors do not believe any content is missing.]
In the spirit of DuBois, the NAACP is today one of the largest self-help groups in the country. It is no accident that, for 95 years, we've led the way in taking personal responsibility for making right America's wrongs.
DuBois understood, as do we, that poverty's symptoms must not be confused with poverty's causes. He said:
""(M)en have a right to object to a race so poor and ignorant and inefficient as the mass of Negroes; but if their policy in the past is parent of much of this condition, and if today by shutting black boys and girls out of most avenues of decent employment they are increasing pauperism and vice, then they most hold themselves largely responsible for the deplorable results.""iii

DuBois arrived here in Philadelphia in 1896, the same year the United States Supreme Court ratified separate and unequal lives for black and white Americans in Plessy v. Ferguson.
We meet 50 years after the Court overruled Plessy and unanimously declared, in Brown v. Board of Education, that segregated schools violated the Constitution's promise of equal protection.
There can be no mistake — those fifty years since Brown have seen the fortunes of black America advance and retreat, but the decision is always cause for sober celebration, not impotent dismay.
We celebrate the brilliant legal minds who were the architects of Brown v. Board; we celebrate the brave families who were its plaintiffs; and we celebrate the legal principle that remains its enduring legacy — that, in the words of Chief Justice Earl Warren, ""the doctrine of separate but equal has no place.""iv
4
That the quest for meaningful equality — political and economic equity — remains unfulfilled today is no indictment of past efforts. It is testament to the challenge before us.
As we commemorate the 50th anniversary of that landmark decision, it is easy to cast a cynical eye on the status of school desegregation in America today — or the sorry state of race relations — and minimize the significance of Brown. That is a grave mistake, for Brown — by destroying segregation's legality, gave a nonviolent army the power to destroy segregation's morality as well.
Thus it is no coincidence that this year we also celebrate the 40th anniversary of the passage of the 1964 Civil Rights Act — the most sweeping civil rights legislation before or since, and our democracy's finest hour.
When he sent what would become the 1964 Civil Rights Act to Congress, President John F. Kennedy said:
""When Americans are sent to Viet Nam or West Berlin, we do not ask for whites only.""

Today, when Americans are being sent to Afghanistan and Iraq, we do not ask for whites only.
So this convention, as we commemorate these anniversaries, is a time to examine our present in relation to our past. And as we prepare for national elections, this fall, this convention will be a time for an examination of our present in relation to our future.
We look back on the years between Brown and the passage of the 1964 Civil Rights Act with some pride.
In those years, Brown's anniversary became a celebratory signpost, as major events focused on commemorating the date.
5
The year after Brown, Rosa Parks sat down to stand up for her rights, and the Montgomery bus boycott began.
Martin Luther King's first national address was at a 1957 Prayer Pilgrimage on the third anniversary of Brown at the Lincoln Memorial.
Later that same year the Little Rock Nine successfully integrated Little Rock's Central High School.
Sit-ins at segregated lunch counters burst out across the South in 1960, followed by the Freedom Rides of 1961 and the forcible integration of Ole Miss in 1962.
In 1963 alone, the year that King — fresh from the battlefields of Birmingham — told the nation of his dream at the March on Washington, there were more than 10,000 anti-racist demonstrations.
King was the most famous and well known of the modern movement's personalities, but it was a people's movement. It produced leaders of its own; but it relied not on the noted but the nameless, not on the famous but the faceless. It didn't wait for commands from afar to begin a campaign against injustice. It saw wrong and acted against it; it saw evil and brought it down.
Those were the days when women and men of all races and creeds worked together in the cause of civil rights.
Those were the days when good music was popular and popular music was good.
Those were the days when the President picked the Supreme Court and not the other way around.
Those were the days when we had a war on poverty, not a war on the poor. Those were the days when patriotism was a reason for open-eyed disobedience, not an excuse for blind allegiance.
6
Those were the days when the news media really was ""fair and balanced"" and not just cheerleaders for the powerful.
But those were not ""the good old days.""
Then, the American social order was rigidly stratified and racially codified.
In those days, ""(t)he law, the courts, the schools, and almost every institution ... favored whites. This was white supremacy.""v
This was a massive system of racial preferences, a vast affirmative action plan for whites — enforced by law and terror. It began with slave-catching in Africa, and it continues on to the present day.
Only when we acknowledge the name, nature and scope of the problem can we measure the magnitude of our successes — and the cost of our failures.
The day Brown was decided, the NAACP held a news conference to announce an ambitious new agenda. To Thurgood Marshall, Brown was the Magna Carta of black America, a declaration of our rights. School segregation would be eliminated, he thought, within five years. He was right about the former; he was obviously wrong about the latter.
Within a year, in Brown II, the Supreme Court allowed desegregation to proceed ""with all deliberate speed."" For the first time, the Court had declared a right and delayed its implementation.
Three months after Brown II, Emmett Till, who was nearly my age, was murdered in Money, Mississippi, for whistling at a white woman. His death and the black newspapers that came into my Pennsylvania home created a great vulnerability and fear of all things southern in my teenaged mind. When my parents announced in 1957 that we were relocating to Atlanta, I was filled with dread.
7
Emmett Till's death had frightened me. But in the fall of 1957 a group of black teenagers encouraged me to put that fear aside. These young people — the nine young women and men who integrated Central High School in Little Rock, Arkansas — set a high standard of grace and courage under fire as they dared the mobs who surrounded their school.
Here, I thought, is what I hope I can be, if ever the chance comes my way.
The chance to test and prove myself did come my way in 1960, as it came to thousands of other black high school and college students across the South. First through the sit-ins, then in Freedom Rides, and then in the voter registration and political organizing drives in the rural South, we joined an old movement against white supremacy that had deep, strong roots; for many of us, however, it was the recent Brown decision that had created the opportunity for young people to play active roles, to seize and share leadership in the movement for social justice.
Brown was the movement's greatest legal victory. It changed the legal status of black Americans, and ironically made challenges to established movement's narrow reliance on legal action possible.
As Richard Kluger has written: ""Not until the Supreme Court acted in 1954 did the nation acknowledge it had been blaming the black man for what it had done to him. His sentence to second class citizenship had been commuted; the quest for meaningful equality — equality in fact as well as in law — had begun.""vi
I believe in an integrated America — integrated jobs, homes and schools. I believe in it enough to have spent most of life its elusive
8
pursuit. I think it is a legal, moral and political imperative for America — a matter of elemental justice, simple right waged against historical wrong.
Brown was about black inequality, what Lyndon Johnson called ""the one huge wrong of the American nation.""vii
""The Supreme Court said nothing about Latinos until nineteen years after Brown and there never was any significant enforcement of desegregation for Latinos.""viii
Today, ""U.S. schools are becoming more segregated in all regions for both African-American and Latino students.""ix
By contrast, Asian students are the most integrated.x
I not only have spent most of my life in the cause of integration, in 1947 — when I was seven years old — I was a plaintiff in a lawsuit in rural Pennsylvania against segregated schools.
It never came to trial. The school board had segregated schools by giving students achievement tests which all blacks failed and all whites passed, but when the two dumb sons of the local white political boss failed the test, they closed the black school, and all of Lincoln University Village's children went to a one-room school together.
This year I visited Berea College in Kentucky, opened by abolitionists as an integrated school in 1855. It was closed by the Civil War, but opened again in 1866 with 187 students — 96 blacks and 91 whites. It dared to provide a rare commodity in the former slave states: an education open to all — blacks and whites, women and men.
One of those early students was my grandfather.
Like many others, I am the grandson of a slave. My grandfather was born in 1863, in Kentucky; freedom didn't come for him until the
9
13th Amendment was ratified in 1865.
He and his mother were property, like a horse or a chair. As a young girl, she had been given away as a wedding present to a new bride, and when that bride became pregnant, her husband — that's my great-grandmother's owner and master — exercised his right to take his wife's slave as his mistress.
That union produced two children, one of them my grandfather.
At age 15, barely able to read and write, he hitched his tuition — a steer — to a rope and walked across Kentucky to Berea College and the college took him in.
Today, some call us pessimists. How dare they? We are the ones who believed in the American dream even while we lived a nightmare. We not only believed in it, we fought for it. Many died for it. They ought to call us patriots.
When my grandfather graduated from Berea, he was asked to deliver the commencement address. He said then:
""The pessimist from his corner looks out upon the world of wickedness and sin, and blinded to all that is good or hopeful in the condition and progress of the human race, bewails the present state of affairs and predicts woeful things for the future.""
""In every cloud he beholds a destructive storm, in every flash of lightning an omen of evil and in every shadow that falls across his path a lurking foe.""
""He forgets that the clouds also bring life and hope, that the lightning purifies the atmosphere, that shadow and darkness prepare for sunshine and growth, and that hardships and adversity nerve the race, as the individual, for greater efforts and grander victories.xi

10
Greater efforts and grander victories — that is the promise we expect to fulfill at the ballot box this fall.
My grandfather belonged to a transcendent generation of black Americans, a generation born into slavery, a generation freed from servitude by the Civil War, a generation determined to make their way as free women and men. From Berea, he studied for the ministry, married, and had six children — one of them my father, Horace Mann Bond.
My father graduated from Pennsylvania's Lincoln University and earned a doctorate in education from the University of Chicago. For him, too, education was a means to a larger end — the uplift of his people and the salvation of his race.
How fitting, then, that he would be asked to help the NAACP in its legal campaign against school segregation — the campaign that culminated in Brown v. Board of Education.
Perhaps, having done the right thing by denouncing ""separate but equal"", the Court then felt free to delay the implementation of what it had announced. Whatever the reason, the phrase ""with all deliberate speed"" was added to the lexicon of ignominious judicial pronouncements less than a year after one of the most shameful judicial doctrines had been discarded.
For the first ten years after Brown, the emphasis was more on ""deliberate"" than on ""speed."" The focus was on dismantling hhe dual school systems in the South, the products of de jure segregation, and in southern accents, all deliberate speed meant any conceivable delay. Actual integration was more a legal fiction than fact. President Dwight Eisenhower had lobbied Chief Justice Warren to rule for the Southern
11
states and segregated schools; he never endorsed the Brown decision, and the resistant white South, emboldened by his rectitude, reacted with evasion and delay. Their tactics included violence, expansion of private schools, state support for fleeing white students, proposals to abolish public education, repeal of compulsory attendance laws, and the long discarded theories of interposition and nullification. Prince Edward County, Virginia, simply closed its public schools for five years, believing that uneducated children were preferable to integrated ones. Where massive resistance failed, aggressive resistance succeeded.
By the end of 1964, ten years after Brown, more than 97% of all Southern black children still attended segregated schools. There was far too much deliberation and far too little speed.
When Congress was debating the 1964 Civil Rights Act, in all of Alabama, only 29 black students attended formerly white schools, only 9 in South Carolina, and none in Mississippi.
The four years following the passage of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 represent the only period in the 50-year-history of Brown when there was active support for desegregation from both the executive branch and the courts.
For the first time, under a southern President, Lyndon Johnson, the Federal government began to take an active role. This period saw the percentage of black children in school with white ones more than quadruple, rising from 3 to 13%.
But still there were costs. Surrendering to caution, the integration process became a one-way street as a few black students and fewer administrators were admitted to formerly all-white schools. Thousands of black schoolteachers lost their
12
jobs as black and white schools merged. Lost too was history — revered school names, mottoes, mascots, traditions. Plaques, trophy cases, school colors — all the artifacts that honored black achievement disappeared. Black students found themselves in formerly all-white school buildings that retained the character and identity acquired in the segregated past — Booker T. Washington High School vanished; Robert E. Lee High School persevered.
In President Lyndon Johnson's last year in office, the federal government reviewed 29 communities for compliance with desegregation guidelines; in President Richard Nixon's first year, the figure dropped to 16. By the second year it stood at 15; the third year at 11; the fourth year at 9; the first year of his second term at 1, and by the next year, the number dropped to none.
The years 1968-73, however, represent the most active period of Supreme Court intervention on behalf of school desegregation. The court that 13 years earlier had been content to see desegregation proceed ""with all deliberate speed"" ordered segregation removed ""root and branch"" in 1968.xii
To that end, it allowed busing in 1971.xiii
Johnson's commitment to civil rights had sustained enforcement efforts in the South in the face of widespread white opposition. When Republicans captured the White House, the process was politicized, and the principle sanction available to enforce desegregation, cutting off federal funds, was renounced.
The Carter Administration attempted to revive fund cutoff enforcement. Cut-off action was begun in Kansas City. But the only limiting amendment adopted by Congress to the '64 Civil Rights Act
13
was pushed by liberal Democrats Thomas Eagleton of Missouri and Joseph Biden of Delaware, when schools in their home states faced desegregation efforts.
The Reagan Administration launched an attack on school desegregation. They invited school districts to reverse existing desegregation orders and intervened in court cases even where school boards had not requested it. They asked the Supreme Court to authorize tax exemptions for private segregated schools. They settled cases with remedies that had failed elsewhere. They eliminated the major desegregation aid program.
What distinguished the Administrations of Ronald Reagan and George H. W. Bush was their attacks on virtually all components affecting segregation and discrimination in American education.
After passage of the 1964 Civil Rights Act, the first President Bush, then a House member, told his fellow Texans, ""The new Civil Rights Act was passed to protect 14% of the people. I'm worried about the other 86%.""xiv
The percentage of black students at majority white schools in the South went from zero in 1954 to a peak of 43.5 percent in 1988, proving there is nothing wrong with Brown's premise. It is Brown's promise that has been broken — betrayed by a failure of Presidential leadership, defeated by a lack of Congressional oversight and action, ruined by a retreat by the federal bureaucracy charged with enforcement, and crushed by a series of unfavorable court rulings, ranging form the adverse to the hostile.
When William Rehnquist joined the Supreme Court, courtesy of Richard Nixon, all major desegregation cases since Brown had been
14
unanimous. Rehnquist, as a clerk to Justice Jackson during the Brown case, had written a memo arguing that the Court should uphold Plessy v. Ferguson. Then he lied about it at his confirmation hearing. As a Justice himself, Rehnquist cast the first dissenting vote in a post-Brown desegregation case in 1973, setting the stage for what would become a new anti-desegregation majority in the 1990s after he became Chief Justice.
So today we have a Chief Justice who has consistently opposed school desegregation and an Attorney General who built his political career on lambasting the efforts of the federal courts to desegregate St. Louis and Kansas City schools. As Missouri's Attorney General and then Governor, John Ashcroft continually attacked the federal courts managing school integration in his state and, when the courts found the state to be ""the primary constitutional violator,"" he fought to limit the state's contribution to the remedy the court imposed.xv
It is hardly a surprise, then, that when the current state of school integration is examined, discouraging results abound.
If the years since Brown have not succeeded in dismantling segregated schools, those years have seen American support for segregated education shrink.xvi
That is modest achievement for black Americans. For us and other minorities, separate has never been equal, not then, not now.
America's history tells us that has always been true.
There are few matters on which experts in any given field agree. Educational experts, however, agree that no school district in America has managed to create equal education on a large scale in segregated schools, be they black or Hispanic. This is not to say that one-race
15
schools are never successful. A few are — particularly on the elementary level. But the bottom line is that students who attend schools that are segregated by race and income consistently rank lower in educational achievement, especially at the secondary school level.xvii In short, the United States can't afford separate schools.
The educational damage done by racial segregation does not grow from the relationship between blacks and whites alone; it grows from the relationship between blacks and whites and green. In America, the education dollar follows the white child. The students who are most likely to find themselves in schools of concentrated poverty today are not white; they are black and Latino.xviii
Compared with poor whites, poor blacks are more likely to live in neighborhoods where a high percentage of the residents are poor. They interact mainly with others who are poor, who share their disadvantage.
They live, squeezed together, in less than standard housing, in neighborhoods denuded of essential services. Their neighborhoods are economically and racially segregated, bereft of opportunity, out of sight and out of mind.
Their children attend schools only with poor, minority children. As the New Jersey Supreme Court said, ""They face, through no fault of their own, a life of poverty and isolation that most of us cannot begin to understand and appreciate.""xix
Fewer dollars in the parents' pockets mean fewer dollars in the school board's treasury. Children in high poverty schools read less, get lower grades, and miss more days of school.xx
Economic and racial integration are preconditions for equal opportunity. Once achieved, they permanently alter the pattern of
16
minority-majority relationships.
In cities where school integration exists, it is not only the most visible form of desegregation, but the only one that impacts personally on the lives of millions of whites.xxi This is why many whites have so strongly resisted it; it is also why blacks and other minorities must conitnue to insist upon it.
I recently heard Minnie Jean Brown reflect on her experiences as one of the heroic Little Rock Nine who integrated Central High School in 1957. Someone asked why she kept coming back to school day after day, despite daily harassment and intimidation that would have driven most people away.
From the ferocity of her enemies, she said, ""I knew there was something precious inside that school,"" and she was more determined to get it than they were to keep it from her grasp.
There are those who scoff at Brown as if the advantages to black children were to be gained simply by sitting next to white ones in a classroom, as if a skin-to-skin transfer of knowledge and education could occur. These critics miss the point of integrated schools.
Integrated schools are, as one expert said, ""truly radical.""xxii A public educational system that is fully integrated and treats minorities and whites equally, is the antithesis of the largest society, which is profoundly segregated and unequal. The goal of putting minorities and whites in the same classrooms is not only to equalize education, but also to change the formative racial experiences of the next generation.
Today minority children face inequalities in school spending, and more — they face what Jonathan Kozol calls ""punitive testing and accountability agendas"" imposed by the No Child Left Behind Act.
17
Schools have adopted a ""grill and drill curriculum"" that substitutes learning by rote and teaching to the test for the transmission of critical thinking from teacher to pupil.xxiii
On our present course, we are formalizing two school systems: one filled with middle class children, most of them white, and one filled with low-income minorities. For too many, the latter schools have become conveyor belts to prison.
There were an estimated 98,000 blacks imprisoned on the day Brown was decided in 1954. Today there are 884,500. More than half of black men in their early 30s who are high school dropouts also have a prison record.
Here in Pennsylvania, 2 in 3 black fifth graders do not read on grade level, compared to 1 in 3 whites. Four in 5 black eighth graders do not do math on grade level, compared to 2 in 5 of their white counterparts.
Not surprisingly, there is a graduation rate gap, too. Three in 10 blacks from Pennsylvania's high school class of 2002 did not graduate, compared to only 1 in 10 whites.
Pennsylvania spends more than $27,000 annually per prison inmate. That's more than twice the cost of a year's tuition at Pennsylvania State University.
Our future as a nation depends on our willingness to continue to reach into the racial cleavage that defines American society and change the racial contours of our world. In 1954, the Federal government's brief in Brown argued that school desegregation was a cold war imperative, a necessary weapon to win America's battles overseas. Current events give us the same imperative — to prove to enemy and ally
18
alike that our commitment to justice is sincere.
We meet while an unwise war of occupation continues in Iraq, a war without reason or necessity. It was not about weapons of mass destruction, but rather the crass obstruction of the truth.
Now the war has created the very terrorist training camp in Iraq its sponsors said was its cause.
The war's defenders have tried to stifle political debate — if you oppose the war, they say, you don't support our troops.
That's nonsense. If it was up to us, every man and woman stationed in Iraq would be safely at home right now.
When Martin Luther King spoke out against the war in Vietnam in 1965, he was revolted at the hypocrisy of America's claims for freedom overseas when blacks enjoyed few freedoms here. War abroad, King said, stole from Americans at home.
""The pursuit of widened war,"" he said in 1966, ""has narrowed domestic welfare programs, making the poor, white and Negro, bear the heaviest burdens at the front and at home.""
How sadly true those words ring today.
The NAACP has always been non-partisan, but that doesn't mean we're non-critical. For as long as we've existed, whether Democrats or Republicans have occupied the White House, we've spoken truth to power.
When his friends asked Harry Truman, ""Mr. President why do you give the other side so much hell?"" Truman said, ""I just tell the truth and they think its hell!"" When any political party places politics over principle, we're going to give them non-partisan hell!
19
When we were founded in 1909, Theodore Roosevelt was ending his second term. He shared traits with many of today's Negrophobes — he liked individual African-Americans but believed the mass were less than human,
His successor, William Howard Taft, said his ""little brown brothers"" — that's us — would need ""fifty to 100 years"" to become equal with whites.
Woodrow Wilson, who institutionalized segregation in the federal bureaucracy, succeeded Taft. The NAACP's James Weldon Johnson said of him, ""My distrust and dislike ... came neared to constituting keen hatred for an individual than anything I have ever felt.""
Warren Harding, who followed, joked with Johnson about the rumor Harding had African-American blood; where have we heard that before? Whatever kind of blood he had, Harding had neither the heart nor courage to right the wrongs that afflicted people of color.
NAACP Executive Secretary Walter White was prescient in the Calvin Coolidge years when he said, ""The Republicans will absorb the anti-Negro south and become ... the relatively anti-Negro party, while the Negro will find refuge in the Democratic Party.""
White said the next President, Herbert Hoover, showed nothing ""to indicate he regarded Negroes as citizens and human beings.""
Franklin Roosevelt served almost four terms. By the time he died in 1945 his economic policies and the personality and politics of first lady Eleanor Roosevelt has hastened black conversion to the Democratic Party.
Harry Truman became the first President to speak to an NAACP audience.
20
The next President, Dwight Eisenhower, told ""nigger jokes"" in the White House. But he made some black appointments, and his reward was 60% of the black vote against Adlai Stevenson in 1956, temporarily reversing the black slide to the Democrats that Franklin Roosevelt had begun.
John F. Kennedy's 1960 campaign reversed the Eisenhower shift toward Republicans when he pledged to eliminate housing segregation ""with the stroke of a pen"" and when he made a famous telephone call — ignored in the mainstream press — to the wife of jailed Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.
An assassin's bullet brought Lyndon Johnson to office — and he pursued civil rights as had no president before him and no president since. The Civil Rights Act of 1964 and the Voting Rights Act of 1965 are part of his legacy.
But the passage of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and the Voting Rights Act of 1965 marked the beginning of the dependence of the Republican Party on the politics of racial division to win elections and gain power. By playing the race card in election after election, they've appealed to the dark underside of American culture, to the minority of Americans who reject democracy and equality.
They preach racial neutrality and practice racial division. Apparently they really do think we all look alike — to hear them, Martin Luther King and Clarence Thomas are the same man.
They've tried to patch the leaky economy — and every other domestic problem — with duct tape and plastic sheets.
They write a new Constitution for Iraq and ignore the Constitution here at home.
21
[Four handwritten X marks and a delete symbol appear in the right margin, corresponding with inline revisions.]
They say giving health care to all Iraqis is sound policy; they say giving health care to all Americans is socialism.
If a president lies about having an affair, they say ""Impeach him!"" If a president lies about going to war, they say ""Re-elect him!""
If you're a drug addict on the street, they say it's a crime, but if you're a right wing radio talk show host, they say it's an illness.
They said Saddam Hussein was a good guy when President Reagan gave him arms. Then he was a bad guy when the first President Bush went to war with him. Then he was a good guy when Dick Cheney did business with him. He's a bad guy now when they can't find Osama bin Laden.
They say the best way to raise morale in the military is to give them speeches and the American flag use the troops for photo ops while cutting veteran'ss' benefits and combat pay.
They operate a perpetual motion attack machine and squeal like stuck pigs if you answer back.
Overdosed on testosterone, they've descended into the very vulgarity they say they want to keep off the airways.
They believe in the politics of fear; we believe in the politics of hope.
Now they want to write bigotry back into the Constitution; they want to make one group of Americans outsiders to our common heritage. They want to do what has never been done before — to amend the Constitution to create a group of second-class citizens. Our Constitution is the last hope of freedom; it cannot become a carrier of prejudice and intolerance.
22
And what about the opposition party? Too often they're not an opposition; they're an amen corner.
With some notable exceptions, they have been absent without leave from this battle for America's soul.
When one party is shameless, the other party cannot afford to be spineless.
Our economic imbalances not only mean difficult times for many, they also undermine democratic values. The danger is that plutocracy will prevail over democracy, and the free market will rule over the free citizen.
The reason for the current deficit and the vanished surplus can be placed squarely on the tax giveaways to the rich.
To make up for just the initial tax cuts, we would have to cut spending by $5 billion dollars 5 days a week for over a year. That was the whole point — to further enrich the already wealthy and to starve the government, making it unable to meet human needs, signing a death warrant for social programs for decades to come.
War and fear often cause hasty mistakes, costly both in economic and human terms. We need to remember what we are fighting for.
As Justice Sandra Day O'Connor wrote just two weeks ago in the case of ""enemy combatant"" Yasser El Hamdi:
""It is during our most challenging and uncertain moments that our Nation's commitment to due process is most severely tested; and it is in those times that we must preserve our commitment at home to the principles for which we fight abroad.""

We ought to remember the words of President Theodore Roosevelt, who said in 1918,
23
""To announce there must be no criticism of the President, or to stand by the President, right or wrong, is not only unpatriotic and servile, but is morally treasonous to the American public.""

And the words of Ohio Senator Robert Taft, who said two weeks after Pearl Harbor had been attacked:
""I believe there can be no doubt that criticism in time of war is essential to the maintenance of any kind of democratic government.""

And the words of the United States Supreme Court two weeks ago: ""A state of war is not a blank check for the President.""
President Bush chose Martin Luther King's birthday last year to announce that, even though he admitted society continues to do something special against racial minorities,xxiv his administration would not do anything special for them; he opposed the University of Michigan's efforts to promote diversity among its student body.
Bush chose Martin Luther King's birthday this year to unilaterally elevate Charles Pickering to the federal bench — in the face of Pickering's hostility to civil rights and leniency to cross burners.
I was afraid to listen to Bush's speech at the Brown commemoration in Topeka two months ago — afraid he'd announce he was going to repeal the 14th Amendment.
The election this fall is a contest between two widely disparate views of who we are and what we believe. One view wants to march us backward through history — surrendering control of government to special interests, weakening democracy, giving religion veto power over science, curtailing civil liberties, despoiling the environment.
24
The other view promises expanded democracy and giving the people, not plutocrats, control over their government.
John Kerry accepted our invitation to speak at this convention; President Bush did not. About a week ago, President Bush made his 30th visit to Pennsylvania, his most visited state outside his home territory of Texas, Virginia, and Maryland. Yet he couldn't come to Pennsylvania to speak to us. No doubt he thinks he'll take care of colored people by speaking only in our sister organization, the National Urban League.
Of course, Vice President Cheney is having trouble speaking at all — they're still washing his mouth out with soap. He is now knows as ""the Veep of bleep!""
The differences between the candidates this year are neither incremental nor inconsequential.
Yes — the stakes are high, higher than ever in recent memory, and the consequences of loss almost too dire to bear. Fortunately, the race is on!
African-Americans are our nation's largest racial minority, and will remain so for years to come. Their centrality to victory in 2004 cannot be overlooked or left to last-minute afterthoughts or early November drive-by politics.
We must insure every citizen registers and votes. So far, the NAACP and the NAACP National Voter Fund together have registered 100,000 voters in 11 key states.
Let me give some examples of what Reverend Nelson Rivers might call ""the big dogs"" among NAACP Branches.
These will be just the thousandaires. These figures may not be up-to-date, but they set an example for us all.
25
[Three handwritten X marks appear in the right margin, corresponding with inline revisions.]
2,494 registered by the Las Vegas Branch. 1,947 in Reno. 6,333 in Detroit. 1 , 000 by the Branch at Alabama A & M. 5,400 in Tallahassee. 4,393 at Volusia County/Daytona Beach. 1,079 in Cincinnati.
2, 398 in Columbus, Georgia. 3,083 in Savannah. 2,977 in Atlanta.
1,444 in Charlotte-Mecklenburg. 4,765 in Wendell-Wake.
4,323 in Spartanburg. 1,200 in Jackson, Mississippi. 1514 in Grambling, Louisiana. 3,429 in Houston. 2,834 in Dallas. 1,500 in San Antonio. 1,200 in Huntsville.
4,405 in Albuquerque.
18,046 in Memphis, Tennessee.
Any NAACP Branch that isn't registering voters ought to turn in its charter.
All history is worth remembering; not all history is worth repeating. We must guarantee the irregularities, suppression, nullification, and outright theft of black votes that happened on Election Day 2000 never, ever happen again.
There's a poignant scene in Michael Moore's extraordinary movie, ""Fahrenheit 9/11 . "" It takes place on the January day in 2001 when the combined House and Senate have met to certify the winner of the Electoral College vote. Vice President Al Gore is presiding. One by one, members of the Congressional Black Caucus come to the well of the House to ask for an inivestigation of the stolen and suppressed votes in Florida, and to each, Vice President Gore asks a question. , ""Has a member of the Senate signed?""
And one by one the Black Caucus members say ""No.""
No member of the United States Senate would sign a petition to investigate the larceny that took place in Florida.
26
Election 2000 confirmed our deep national divisions. Not only did Al Gore receive 90% of the black vote and George W. Bush a majority of the white vote, whites made up 95 percent of Bush's total votes.
Although 57 percent of voters with incomes under $15,000 voted for Gore, even poor whites cast a majority of their votes for Bush. Similarly, 54 percent of women voted for Gore, but white women slightly favored Bush. In politics, as in life, race trumps class and race trumps gender.
The election revealed a cultural, as well as a racial divide. Gore won every major city and almost all suburbs, while Bush took every small town on a straight line from Redding, California to Springfield, Illinois — giving new meaning to Woody Guthrie's old song — ""This Land is Your Land, This Land is My Land.""
The only demographic groups that cast a unified vote were blacks, Latinos, Jews, union members, and residents of large cities — all of whom voted 60 percent or more for Gore, and white males, who voted 60 percent for Bush.
Having voted along racial lines, not surprisingly blacks and whites were also divided in the post-election fight, with blacks far more alienated from the process and the results.
The NAACP's unprecedented voter registration and education drive four years ago was an unparalleled success. Two million more black voters cast ballots in 2000 than in 1996.
The African-American share of the total vote increased 25 percent or more in four states, but we know that the black share of the vote could have been higher — and the consequences could not have been greater.
27
I'll say it again-any Branch in the Association that is not registering voters ought to turn in its charter.
The sorry story of voter suppression and nullification in Florida was told by witness after witness at NAACP hearings after the 2000 election. They described police stops near polling places, racially motivated voter purges, demands for multiple forms of identification from persons who had voted for decades, long-time voters' names missing from the rolls, and other examples of black votes not being cast and not being counted.
What isn't as well know is these tactics were not limited to Florida, and weren't restricted to black precincts. Other minority voters elsewhere in the country suffered as well. We can expect more of the same this year.
Florida already is at it again. We've had to ask the Attorney General of the United States to stop Florida from using another soiled list on Election Day. And that may be like asking the fox to guard the chicken coop.
Our response to these tactics must not be cynicism and despair. If you don't vote because you fear your vote won't count, you're absolutely right — if you don't vote, you won't count! You'll be letting the bad guys win. Our response must be determination — to flood the polls and cast our votes in such large numbers that there will be no doubt. That's letting the good guys win.
Any long-suffering Red Sox fan ought to know — your team won't win if you don't touch the base — or if you run too far outside the base path.
The race is on!
28
You cannot win this race by ignoring race.
We know that if whites and non-whites vote in the same percentages as they did in 2000, Bush will be re-defeated by 3 million votes.
And we know that blacks are increasingly angry about the economy and the war. The nation has lost more than 2.5 million jobs in the last three years. The black unemployment rate is double that for whites. A recent poll in six key states — here and in Ohio, Missouri, Florida, Michigan and Nevada — found that 73 percent of blacks believe Iraq was not worth fighting for and a whopping 77 percent believe that Bush intentionally mislead the nation about the war.
These are voters ready to turn anger into action, to work for regime change here at home. But they have to be asked. They have to be registered, organized, and mobilized. That job must be done by our existing grassroots organizations. We have a track record and we have earned our community's trust.
Black Americans have alway worshiped at the alter of the American ideal, believing deeply in participatory democracy. Together with other minorities and like-minded whites, we can, in the words of the poet Langston Hughes:
""Let America be America again.
Let it be the dream it used to be.
Let it be the pioneer on the plain,
Seeking a home where he himself is free.
O, let my land be a land where liberty
Is crowned with no false patriotic wreath,
But opportunity is real, and life is free,
Equality is in the air we breathe.
29
O, yes,
I say it plain,
America never was America to me,
And yet I swear this oath —
America will be!""

Wade.
In the NAACP, we not only believe colored people come in all colors; we've always known they come in both genders, and we have made it our business for 95 years to insure that everyone — regardless of race, ethnicity or gender —receives the equal protection of the law.
One of the most important protections is guaranteeing the right to reproductive freedom and choice.
Open and equal access to family planning has been NAACP policy since 1968i.
And I am more than proud to be married to Pamela Horowitz, who successfully argued Relf vs. Weinberger, the case which ended the involuntary sterilization practices of what was then the Department of Health, Education and Welfare. She also helped win an early anti-trust case on behalf of a women's health center in Tallahassee, Florida, involved in a fight with the local medical establishment over the provision of abortions.
The right to reproductive freedom is as basic as the right to eat at a lunch counter or to cast a vote — or the right of two humans to marry. If a woman cannot control her own body, she doesn't have equal protection of the law.
Reproductive rights have deep roots in African-American history and in the history of the NAACP. Enslaved women, victims of sexual exploitation by their masters, used crude methods to abort unwanted children.
Early in the 20th Century, the National Urban League asked Planned Parenthood's forerunner to open a clinic in the Bronx to serve women of color. Black newspapers
2
promoted family planning and championed black doctors arrested for performing illegal abortions.ii
In the 1960s, one of the few physicians providing safe, illegal abortions in Chicago was Dr. T. R. M. Howard, a black man who had been run out of Mississippi because of his civil rights activism.
More than eight decades ago the NAACP's most distinguished founder, Dr. W. E. B. DuBois, understood that making birth control available to poor women helped them gain control over their lives. He wrote an essay on birth control for Margaret Sanger. He attended a house-warming for her clinic in Harlem. He not only believed in full economic rights for women, but in a woman's right to control her body and her life. Every woman, he wrote in 1920, must have the right of procreation ""at her own discretion"".iii
And black women today exercise that precious right at a rate far exceeding their percentage in the population, and large majorities identify themselves as pro-choice.
Just as some people mistakenly believe that Brown v. Board of Education ended segregation in education, some think that Roe v. Wade ended the unavailability of abortion. They are wrong — as you know — the right to choose is under vigorous and widespread attack.
From parental notification legislation to clinic regulation to prohibitions on contraception, the enemies of choice are ever active, always eager to deny equal protection of the law. Their antagonism toward women exercising free agency would make the Taliban blush.
Abortion providers around the country are forced to pay a cruel terrorism tax to protect themselves from murderers and assassins. The national climate in which they operate is forbidding — when one of our political parties is shameless, the other cannot afford to be spineless.
We are just past the annual celebration of the life and legacy of Dr. King.
Those were the days when good music was popular and popular music was good. Those were the days when the President picked the Supreme Court and not the other way around.
3
Those were the days when we had a war on poverty, not a war on the poor. Those were the days when patriotism was a reason for open-eyed disobedience, not an excuse for blind allegiance.
These are very different days — in some ways more difficult days — we face today. Who among us in those days would ever believe we'd fear the day when Chief Justice Rehnquist might retire?
Among the many outrages we face — large and small - is the plan to replace the eight minute film shown to visitors at the Lincoln Memorial. Today it features marches for abortion rights, civil rights, and gay rights. Now, declaring it presents a ""leftist political agenda"", they propose to remake the film and write us out of our nation's history at one of our most sacred national monuments.
It is sacred— which is why it should not be faith-based.
This year is also the 40th anniversary year of the passage of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and the 50th anniversary of the Supreme Court's ruling in Brown v. Board of Education. We realize there's been tremendous progress but much, much more remains to be done to make the promise of the Brown decision and the '64 Civil Rights Act real. And to make the protections of Roe secure.
Great disparities of opportunity still shame and disgrace our nation — vast disparities between whites and people of color, and between women and men.
These anniversaries ought to be occasions for reflection and commemoration, but they cannot be cause for celebration. But we do celebrate the principles involved and vow that, one day, those principles will be observed and honored by all.

The taint comes from centuries of sell-outs, from broken promises and pledges, from the violation of oaths, the disregard of platforms and public declarations.
The taint is well earned. It is not the purpose of this discussion to argue that politics is pure or that politics is the best method of solving the white problem in America.
Here I intend to suggest that in the future properly practiced politics can win rewards. Properly applied political pressure can pave streets, get garbage picked up, make schools better, bring jobs to the jobless and homes to the homeless.
It should not be assumed that politics will solve every social ill or even attempt to rectify three and one-half centuries of brutality and insensitivity. It should not be assumed that a Stokes in Cleveland or Hatcher in Gary make life immediately more liveable for the black citizens of those cities.
It should be assumed, however, that we have not tried politics as we should and it should be assumed that politics for us ought to mean the art of deciding who gets how much of what from whom.
2
Given that definition and the restrictions mentioned above, politics ought to mean for us a chance — and a good chance — of having something to say about what is being done to us. It is no more than that and no less; a hand in the solution of the white problem in America.
With the elections of Richard Hatcher in Gary, Indiana, and Carl Stokes in Cleveland, Ohio, there is a great deal of speculation about political potentials for Negroes across the nation.
A survey conducted by Mrs. Almena Lomax in her magazine, the Tribune, estimated that fair elections and proportional representation based on one-man-one-vote, would give Negroes 61 additional congressional seats. Her estimates are of course based on the assumption that in addition to being fair and proportional, the elections of 1968 will find Negroes in all of the states of the United States in a condition unlike any condition we have ever approached before, the condition of being unified across lines of party and class.
The lack of unity that frustrates Negro political aspirations has its roots in 100 years of dealings with the most frustrating of all the arts, the art of politics.
3
Almost 100 years ago, a Negro Georgian wrote about the political prospects and a political program for Negroes in the United States.
""The black man, who was betrayed by his party and murdered by the opponents of his party, is absolved from all allegiances which gratitude may have dictated, and is today free to make conditions the best possible with any faction which will insure him in his right to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.""
In the years since then, his brothers in the South discovered — until recently — that politics was not for them. For 100 years, North and South, East and West, Negroes have been caught between the definitions of politics that declare politics is the art of the possible and the art of compromise. For Negroes, the compromise has been the compromise of his right to live, and the possible has been for him the realization that under present politics, most things are impossible.
A writer in the 1960's, Lerone Bennett, has described the Negro's situation as radical, and his usual means of seeking redress — the art of politics — as a moderate solution. Thus, he writes, the ""black man has been condemned to seek radical ends within a political framework which was designed to prevent sudden and radical social and economic changes.""
4
For above all else, politics is the art practiced by insiders for insiders on behalf of other insiders. And North and South, East and West, the American Negro has always been an outsider.
It would be better to let Mr. Bennett's words speak for him here. He asks:
""Is politics relevant to our contemporary crisis which cannot be resolved without political programs of depth and dimension never before attempted in American? Is politics relevant to the question of the redistribution of income and the restructuring of the fundamental institutions of this society? Is politics relevant to black reality? Beyond all that, beyond the specific problems of black people, we must ask whether politics is relevant to white people? Is it relevant to the emptiness and hysteria and the unresolved social and economic problems in the white community? Watts and Newark and Detroit put these questions on the agenda of American life. In a very real sense, these rebellions were devastating critiques of the American Way of Politics. In rebellion, the black people of America said they were voting more and enjoying it less.""
The history of the involvement of American Negroes with politics is not a very bright one. It is a history of a virtual castration of all Negro political life in the South
5
and the building of white-controlled black political colonies in the big cities of the North and West.
Throughout this history, black men have played the dual role of actors and the acted-upon for manipulators of black communities. The Negro as a political animal has had little to do with politics from the inside; as a creature of action, action often violent and bloody, he has managed some slight shoves toward entering the political system and becoming a small, small part of the inside.
When black men first came to this country, we faced a system that allowed certain advances won by ambition and hard work. Some of us owned land and slaves. We lived and worked with whites through the 13 colonies, and voted in 11 of them.
But the introduction of slavery by race — instead of slavery by class — ended what might have become the first interracial democracy in the West. Through the entire period of slavery, we became the acted upon instead of actors inside the political system.
The is not to say that we did not vote for we did without casting ballots. The presence of this dark, looming mass, poised dangerously near every white in the Southern region at least, presented an overwhelming reminder that the politics of that era must by nature have been repressive, arbitrary and discriminatory not only against the blacks who
6
were completely excluded but against poor whites, the majority white population of the Southern states, who were as effectively cut out of politics as though none had ever held a ballot in his hands.
We might also say that such men as Nat Turner and Denmark Vesey voted; silently, swiftly in the dark of night, voted their violent disapproval of a political system whose ghosts still haunt us today.
The Civil War broke this pattern for a second; the Reconstruction Era that followed marked the first — and in fact only — real political participation by black men in politics in a meaningful way.
In the beginning, black men were again the acted upon, recipients of the benefits of the 14th and 15th Amendments and a Civil Rights Act which makes those discussed and defeated in Congress today appear like tissue paper dreams in comparison.
But while Reconstruction gave the South its free public schools and instituted many other reforms, it escaped the economic revolution that could have meant, 100 years later, a quiet summer for residents of Watts, Detroit and Newark.
Instead, reconstruction gave us the most infamous use of politics as the art of compromise — the compromise of 1877 — the high point in dirty deals which gave Rutherford B. Hayes the presidency in return for the nation turning its back on the helpless, hopeful Negro citizens of the South. Inside
7
ten years, they were still helpless, not quite so hopeful, and no longer citizens.
Again, in the years following Reconstruction, Southern black men voted without votes — this time with their feet. They swelled into the cities of the North and West, building — and having built around them — black ghettoes that 75 years later, in 1964, 1965 and 1966 and 1967 are exploding with all of the force and misery built up over 75 years.
For Reconstruction had worked, for a while, for ten years. It had held out the promise that the American dilemma could be resolved and that the American dream could come true.
When those ten years ended, a dream had been deferred. And the late Langston Hughes wrote that a dream deferred is like a raisin in the sun — it will fester, then explode.
As Disillusioned Negroes by the tens of thousands arrived in Detroit or Chicago or New York, they saw a certain sort of politics beckoning. It was a politics of machines and and politics of favors, a politics that allowed black men to operate — but not to control — their own communities.
Despite this machinery, the machinery that has produced the most entrenched and the most corrupt of all Negro politicians, a sort of politics that made black voters partial actors again; there were some gains. When Negroes
8
made the big shift from the Republican to Democratic party with the New Deal, individual Negro politicans began to flex their muscles. It seemed as though the temper of America had changed. The Supreme Court declared segregation was illegal. The Negro vote in the South peeked out on the world again, and what we then believed was a second Reconstruction had begun.
But we soon discovered that while things had vastly improved for some few of us, for most of us they were the same or worse.
Listen to President Johnson describing the plight of America's Negroes in 1965:
""In 1948, the President said, 'the 8% unemployment rate for Negro teenage boys was actually less than that of whites.' By 1964, the rate had grown to 23 per cent, as against 13 per cent for whites. Between 1949 and 1959, the income of Negro men relative to white men declined in every section of the country. From 1952 and 1963, the median income of Negro families compared to white actually dropped from 57 per cent to 53 per cent. Since 1947, the number of white families living in poverty has decreased 27 per cent, while the number of poor nonwhite families decreased only 3 per cent. The infant mortality of nonwhites in 1940 was 70 per cent greater than whites. In 1962, it was 90 per cent greater.""

11
Or ought we not examine what our situation is, discover where we are and where we will be in 10 or 15 years, and begin to behave in a manner calculated to give us the maximum political relief.
We have become, with the rest of America, an urban population. In Washington, D. C., where we can't elect even a dogcatcher, much less a mayor, we are over 60 % of the population. To mention a few cities — Richmond, Nashville, New Orleans, Jacksonville and Birmingham, Negro populations are over 40 %.
Atlanta will have a Negro majority soon, but like the city fathers in Nashville and Jacksonville and countless other near-black-majority cities, this political potential is being diluted through city-county mergers, removing real power from the Negro bloc until the Negro birth rate catches fast expanding municipal limits.
Compton, California; Gary, Indiana; Baltimore, St. Louis, Newark, Detroit and Trenton will have near majority Negro populations by 1970.
To understand what these figures do not mean, one must understand what life in the ghetto of Newark, or Baltimore, or Trenton must mean in 1967 and in 1970.
Dr. Kenneth Clark has described it well:
[Manuscript pages do not include page 12. See Speech on Black People and Politics, May 1968 for a version of this speech including that page.]
13
cannot match, but narrowly wins the general election with only 20 % of the white votes.
A Negro runs for mayor of Memphis, Tennessee. Again, he is qualified, possessing an admiral record in his state's legislature, but is defeated in the primary when members of his own community decide that what white people have told them for so many years must be correct — Negroes have never done, therefore this Negro can't do.
Negroes win several seats in a Southern legislature. The complete refusal of white legislators to extend any cooperation frustrates their every attempt to promote progressive legislation.
A Negro congressman, with a legislative record of progress and liberalism that wins the praises of two presidents, is caught performing acts that make him appear as a sticky-fingered saint in a dean of thieves. A collection of men whose own affairs would, if lightly studied, crumple like paper houses take upon themselves the right heretofore reserved for the electorate alone to decide that this man cannot sit in Congress's hallowed halls.
A Negro city councilwoman in the enlightened Northwest introduces a fair housing bill before her council four times. Each time, her vote is the only one that keeps it from being unanimously defeated. Frustrated, she joins Negro militants in street demonstrations, is arrested and jailed.
14
Will these patterns be repeated when Negroes in Shreveport, Oakland, Chattanooga, Camden, Kansas City and a host of other cities really flex their political muscles? Will there be established a pattern so familiar to all American Negroes, the pattern that gives us Jackie Robinson to hit home runs for all Negroes whose race — not their talent kept them out, that gives us Ralph Bunch to sit in a position of prominence for all Negroes whose skin, not their lack of intelligence, kept them out, a pattern that gives us Edward Brooke to get elected for all Negroes whose race, not their politics or platform kept them out?
That pattern is a mix of the saying that once spelled the difference between race relations North and South — in the North, you could get as big as you wanted to but not too close, and in the South, Negroes could get as close as they wanted to, but not too big. Today's pattern allows Negroes to push as hard as they wish, but does not allow resistance to slacken in proportion to the amount of the demand.
In the Southern part of the United States, there are experiments being conducted with politics by Negroes.
One, in Mississippi, has separated Negroes from the all-white state Democratic party in favor of ties with the national Democratic party. The national party refused in Atlantic City four years ago to accept this gift of Negro votes
15
and Negro favor, and there is some question as to how long the hand of friendship will be extended.
The other experiment is in Lowndes County, Alabama, where independent politics are beginning to have real meaning. The Lowndes County Freedom Organization, known more popularly as the original Black Panther party, has hopefully began to make a real dent on a political structure that has survived Kissing Jim Folsom and is starting its second dose of Wallaces.
Neither of these two experiments can be expected to be transferred, wholesale, to other Negro communities in other regions of the United States. But both examples do spell out what a popular song has called the theory of ""different strokes for different folks.""
That theory is that American Negroes, in spite of their being subjected to the same discriminations and hardships, are different folks. We have our Republicans and Democrats and Independents and too many of our own Facists.
We have our communities which apparently have never the news of Lincoln's assassination, and have voted Republican since his Presidency, and our communities — North and South — where voting is still ""white folks business.""
We have our communities where political gains could be won tomorrow, if we ever got the courage to fight white people as successfully as we fight ourselves.
And we have our political leaders who, through

In 1776, the British Royal Navy gave preference to ""cripples and infirm persons"" as cooks on its ships. So — affirmative action may be just one of the many American ideas inherited from the British. It took the former colony about 200 years to expand and implement the Royal Navy's concept.
Today, although even the definition of affirmative action is the subject of intense debate, in the United States it broadly means ""any effort to expand equal opportunity for women or racial, ethnic and national origin minorities by using membership in those groups which have been subject to discrimination as a consideration.""1
Language matters, of course. In the United States, opponents of affirmative action have succeeded in making it synonymous with ""preferential treatment"" for minorities and disfavor for whites.
In Great Britain, as I understand it, similar confusion exists between ""positive action,"" which is allowed, and ""positive discrimination,"" which generally is not.
""Equal opportunity,"" another term which encompasses a myriad of practices, has become a global phenomenon. IBM, for example, does business in about 178 countries, and fully a third
2
of them require equal opportunity in employment.
Just last month the International Labor Organization (ILO) Issued its first global report on workplace discrimination.2 The study warns of a persistent ""equality gap,"" especially for women and people of color.
Your government recently announced that it is in the process of assembling a list of racist employers in an effort to end discrimination in the workplace within ten years.3
The EU Treaty Directives that govern the 15 member states effective by the end of this year, generally cover gender, ethnicity, national origin, language, sexual orientation, and disability. In many jurisdictions, employers are being required to take affirmative steps in support of the new legislation.
The global reach of affirmative action is illustrated by, of all places, South Korea. Seoul National University, which is South Korea's most prestigious, is now engaged in a debate over affirmation action every bit as contentious as the one about the University of Michigan, one of the United States' most prestigious universities.4
At Seoul National University, where almost all of the students are not only Korean but also named Kim or Lee or Park, the debate is over region of origin.
At the University of Michigan, of course, the debate is over race. Two cases argued jointly before the United States Supreme Court in April challenge the constitutionality of the University's use of race in undergraduate and law school
3
admissions.
Because these are the first affirmative action cases to reach the highest court in recent years, and because the court has been highly divided on equality issues, usually ruling 5 to 4 against inclusion policies, the outcome is being closely watched.
This is not the first time that affirmative action has been under assault. In 1985, Ronald Reagan's angry white men — Edwin Meese, William Bradford Reynolds, and William Bennett — attempted to gut a program requiring affirmative action by federal contractors. When word leaked to the press, public reaction saved the program.
When, soon after, Reagan attempted to elevate Reynolds from Assistant to Associate Attorney General, the Senate Judiciary Committee refused to recommend him because of his opposition to affirmative action.
In 1990, the first President Bush contemplated an executive order banning racial preferences in employment. Bush was no stranger to the argument that civil rights victories for blacks meant losses for whites. After the passage of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, Bush told Texas voters he would work to develop job opportunities for those ""displaced from jobs ... by the new Civil Rights Act"".5
""The new Civil Rights Act was passed to protect 14% of the people,"" Bush said then. ""I'm also worried about the other 86%.""6
Again, after word leaked to the press about the Bush plan, public reaction forced the abandonment of this effort.
4
In 1991, an Assistant Secretary of Education announced that henceforth, no scholarship could be reserved for black students only. Once again, this policy was reversed in response to public opinion.
The battle over affirmative action has never been just a legal fight, but a political one as well. As the political landscape in the United States has shifted rightward, support for affirmative action has diminished. Ronald Reagan and the first George Bush helped make it safe for George W. Bush to pursue an agenda once regarded as unthinkable. Among his targets: affirmative action.
This fight is not really about white women and other minorities, although they are also affirmative action's beneficiaries and will be victims with blacks if it falls.7 This is much like yesterday's battle over bussing black children to white schools — that wasn't about the bus, it was about us!
There is another reason to talk about affirmative action in the context of blacks. Many ethnic, racial, religious and other groups have real and legitimate grievances and have in the past suffered and do today suffer from grievous discrimination.
The central moral dilemma of the United States, however, is how it treats the one group whose members it enslaved. The law has a special obligation to blacks — as the sole beneficiaries of the Thirteenth Amendment to the Unites States Constitution — when it comes to defining and remeding discrimination.
When a limited number of awards are demanded by the limitless
5
number of claimants, then civil rights can be as threatened today as they were 40 years ago.
In one sense, the civil rights movement has succeeded beyond its original sponsors' wildest dreams and claims.
Racists in Congress tried to kill the 1964 Civil Rights Act by loading it down with what they thought was a laughable and ridiculous protected category — gender.
They could not have imagined how widespread their expansion of civil rights protections would become.
Today, through executive order, court decisions and legislative act, the protected classes extend to a majority of all Americans, including white ethnics, the aged, short people, the chemically dependent, the left-handed, the obese, and all religions. Someday we ought to examine how the road to civil rights became so crowded — and what the consequences are.
There is obviously something wrong when the claims of the descendants of property sold in slave markets in the American South are held equal with the claims of short, chemically dependent, left-handed white men.
A great jurist, Frank M. Johnson, Jr., told a commencement at Boston University years ago:
""Religious differences, race differences, sex differences, age differences and political differences are not the same. It is no mark of intellectual soundness to treat them as if they were. Moreover, if the life of the law has been experience, then the law should be realistic enough to treat certain issues as special; as racism is special in American history. A judiciary that cannot declare that is of little value.""

Unfortunately, today we have a Supreme Court that not only cannot declare that, it cannot even see the difference between race as a burden or a benefit. As Justice Clarence Thomas put it in a concurring opinion in a case which struck down federal minority contracting programs:
""[I]t is irrelevant whether a government's racial classifications are drawn by those who wish to oppose a race or by those who have a sincere desire to help those thought to be disadvantaged.""8

Whether race is burden or benefit is all the same to those theorists; that is what they mean when they speak of being color-blind.
They are color-blind, blind to the consequences of being the wrong color in America today.
Or, as Justice Stevens put it with some eloquence in his dissent:
""There is no moral or constitutional equivalence between a policy that is designed to perpetuate a caste system and one that seeks to eradicate racial subordination.""9

Justice Ruth Ginsburg, one of the two Clinton appointees on the court, emphasized the ""persistence of racial inequality"" and the need ""to act affirmatively, not only to end discrimination, but also to counteract discrimination's lingering effects.""10
""Bias both conscious and unconscious"", Justice Ginsburg wrote, ""reflecting traditional and unexamined patterns of thought, keeps up barriers that must come down if equal opportunity and nondiscrimination are ever genuinely to become this nation's law and practice.""11

The United States is such a young nation so recently removed from slavery that only my father's generation stands between Julian Bond and human bondage. Like many in my country, I am the grandson of a slave.
My grandfather was born in 1863, in Kentucky; freedom didn't come for him until the Thirteenth Amendment to the Constitution was ratified in 1865.
He and his mother were property, like a horse or a chair. As a young girl, she had been given away as a wedding present to a new bride, and when that bride became pregnant, her husband — that's my great grandmother's owner and master — exercised his right to take his wife's slave as his mistress.
That union produced two children — one of them my grandfather.
The Civil War that freed him from slavery was fought over whether blacks and whites shared a common humanity. Less than ten years after it ended, the nation chose sides with the losers, and agreed to continue black repression for almost 100 years.
American slavery was a human horror of staggering dimensions, a crime against humanity. The profits it produced endowed great fortunes and enriched generations, and its dreadful legacy embraces all Americans today.
As the historian John Hope Franklin has written:
""All whites ... benefited from American slavery. All blacks had no rights they could claim as their own. All whites, including the vast majority who owned no slaves, were not only encouraged but authorized to exercise dominion
8
over all slaves, thereby adding to the system of control.""
""...even poor whites benefited from the legal advantage they enjoyed over all blacks, as well as from the psychological advantage of having a group beneath them.""
""Most living Americans do have a connection with slavery. They have inherited the preferential advantage, if they are white, and the loathsome disadvantage, if they are black, and these positions are virtually as alive today as they were in the 19th Century.""

Two hundred and forty-six years of slavery were followed by 100 years of state-sanctioned discrimination, reinforced by public and private terror, ending only after a protracted struggle in 1965.
Thus it has only been a short 38 years that all black Americans could claim the full rights of citizens, only 38 years since legal segregation was ended nationwide, only 38 years since the right to register and vote was universally guaranteed, only 38 years since the protections of the law and Constitution were formally extended to all.
Affirmative action was created to fight what Supreme Court Justice Sandra Day O'Connor has called ""the unhappy persistence of both the practice and the lingering affects of racial discrimination."" It did not come into widespread use in the United States until the 1970s.
Now its opponents tell us 30 years of corrective practices are sufficient to erase nearly 400 years of persistent and entrenched white supremacy.
To believe that is the victory of hope over experience.
9
To believe that is the victory of self-delusion over common sense.
The modern movement for civil rights — which produced affirmative action — has its immediate origins in the Supreme Court's decision in Brown v Board of Education in 1954. Brown effectively ended segregation's legality, and it gave a nonviolent army license to attack segregation's morality as well.
A year after Brown, an NAACP activist in Montgomery, Alabama refused to give up her seat on a city bus so a white man could sit down. Five years after Montgomery, four young black men, college students in Greensboro, North Carolina, refused to give up their seats at a restaurant lunch counter reserved for whites.
These small acts of passive resistance to American apartheid — and the cumulative acts of tens of thousands more — created a people's movement that eliminated segregation laws in less than a decade.
Their removal has ironically made it too easy for too many to believe that all forms of racism have disappeared. Americans celebrated the end of legal discrimination and vastly underestimated racism's capacity to persevere.
Opinion polls reveal a majority of American whites belief racial discrimination is no longer an impediment for people of color. In one study, 75 percent of whites said blacks face no discrimination in obtaining jobs or housing, even as study after study reports such discrimination endures, and in some cases, is becoming more severe.
10
Polls show most white Americans believe equal educational opportunity for all races exists now, even as our schools are becoming more, not less segregated, across the county.
It is in this climate that attacks on affirmative action persist, not because the policy has failed, but because it has succeeded.
It helped create the sizeable middle class that now constitutes one-third of all black Americans. In the late 1960s, wages of black women in the textile industry tripled. From 1970 to 1990, the number of black police officers, lawyers and doctors doubled. Black electricians and college students tripled; black bank tellers more than quadrupled.
Opponents of affirmative action argue that its application carries a stigma that attaches to all blacks — as if none of us ever felt any stigma in the days before affirmative action was created.
One seldom hears this argument about the many thousands of whites who got into university because Dad was an alumnus.
Of the nine Supreme Court justices who are about to decide fate of affirmative action in the United States, five either entered university as so-called ""legacies"" or saw their children do so.
During oral arguments in the Michigan cases, one of those justices asked a lawyer for the white students, ""what is the difference"" between a university favoring the children of alumni and favoring minority applicants?12
11
President George W. Bush is the second of three generations of the Bush family to enjoy such preferences — extra boosts given to the children of Yale alumni.
One seldom hears any argument about those who got a good job because Dad was president of the company — or President of the United States.
You never see them walking around, heads held low, moaning that everyone in the executive washroom is whispering about how they got their jobs. Most of the United States' elite professions have been and remain today the near exclusive province of white men. I serious doubt that a single one of these men is suffering low self-esteem because his race and gender helped him win his job.
As one writer put it:
""Would the black student rather be at Princeton and be thought less competent, or be thought less competent and not be at Princeton?""

As quiet as it is kept by those who pronounce themselves ""colorblind"" in his name, Martin Luther King supported affirmation action.
He said in 1963:
""It is impossible to create a formula for the future which does not take into account that society has been doing something special against the Negro for hundreds of years. How then can he be absorbed into the mainstream of American life if we do not do something special for him now, in order to balance the equation and equip him to compete on a just and equal basis?""13

President Bush chose Martin Luther King's birthday to announce that even though society continues to do something
12
special against racial minorities, his administration would not do anything special for them and instead would support opponents of Michigan's efforts to promote diversity among its student body.
The President characterized Michigan's program as ""a quota"", which it is not. His use of this charged word was an attempt to disguise his failure to support justice.
The Bush Administration likes to use Secretary of State Colin Powell and National Security Advisor Condoleezza Rice as human shields against criticisms of their record on civil rights. After all, the President is proud of saying, his administration is the most diverse in history — except for the one which preceded it.
But the day after the administration filed its brief in the Michigan cases, Ms. Rice issued a rare statement on a domestic issue, saying, ""(I)t is appropriate to use race as one factor among others in achieving a diverse student body.""14
And she has acknowledged that affirmative action was responsible for her employment at Stanford University.15
Secretary Powell, for his part, has long been an outspoken advocate of affirmative action and has specifically said he hopes the University of Michigan prevails in court.
Secretary Powell is not alone among former military leaders who support affirmative action. Newly 30 of America's top former military and civilian defense officials, including three former chairmen of the Joint Chiefs of Staff and several four-star
13
generals, asked the Supreme Court to uphold the university's affirmative action policies.
Their brief was but one from more than 300 organizations across society — representing academia, corporate America, and labor — which filed briefs in support of Michigan.
What they shared in common is the belief, as Michigan's Law School Dean wrote that:
""(c)olorblindness is an ideal, not an idol, and the Constitution does not require us to sacrifice effective education and integration in its name.""16

No one can deny that the American racial scene has vastly improved since the Supreme Court spoke in Brown almost 50 years ago. But despite progress, racial division remains the rule, racial stratification the reality, and life chances assigned by race remain the certainty for too many.
""Compared with poor whites, poor blacks are more likely to live in neighborhoods where a high proportion of the residents are poor.""17

""They interact mainly with others who are poor, who share their disadvantage. They live, squeezed together, in less than standard housing, in neighborhoods that have been denuded of essential services. They shop at stores owned by merchants geared to do business with a poor clientele. Their neighborhoods are economically segregated, bereft of opportunity, out of sight and often out of mind. Their children attend schools only with other poor children.""
""They face, through no fault of their own, a life of poverty and isolation that most of us cannot begin to understand and appreciate.""18

In America today, compared with a white child, a black child is one and a half times more likely to:

grow up in a family whose head did not finish high school.

14
That child is two times as likely to:

be born to a teenaged mother, be unemployed as a teenager and unemployed as an adult.

That child is two and a half times more likely to:

be born at low birth weight and to die during the first year of life.

That child is three times more likely to:

live in a single parent home.

That child is four times more likely to:

have a mother who had no pre-natal care, or a mother who dies in childbirth, or to die from HIV infection.

That child is four and a half times as likely to live with neither parent.
That child is five times as likely to depend solely on a mother's earnings and be arrested for a violent crime.
That child is nine times as likely to be a victim of homicide as a teenager or young adult, the end of a long, winding uphill struggle to beat the social odds against success.
And when that child plays by the rules, stays in school and graduates, he or she will not earn on an equal level with whites. A black high school graduate is nearly one and a half times more likely to be unemployed than a white high school dropout, and a black college graduate is more likely to be unemployed than a white high school graduate with no college education.
Today, the income of black families in which one family member has a post-graduate degree is lower on average than white
15
families in which the highest level of education achieved is graduation from elementary school.
Whether one holds a Ph. D. degree or elementary school certificate, it is black skin, not yellowed parchment that determines life chances.
One hundred plus years ago, black Americans faced prospects eerily similar to those we face today. Then, thirty years after the Civil War and the first Reconstruction, as the 19th Century wound down, white Americans grew weary of worrying about the welfare of the new freed slaves, tired of fighting to secure their right to vote or attend a public school.
Then, as now, a race-weary nation decided these problems could best be solved if left to the individual states. Then, a reign of state-sanctioned and private terror, including ritual human sacrifice, swept across the South to reinforce white supremacy. Now, hate groups and neo-Nazis roam the land.
Then, as now, the highest court in the land refused the judicial protection that ought to be accorded to the minority in a democracy, and, ignoring reality, declared instead:
""When a man has emerged from slavery, and by the aid of beneficent legislation has shaken off the inseparable concomitant of that state, there must be some stage in the progress of this elevation when he takes the rank of mere citizen, and ceases to be the special favorite of the laws, and when his rights as a citizen, or a man, are to be protected in the ordinary modes by which other men's rights are protected.""19

One hundred and twenty years after that Supreme Court pronouncement, no one can convincingly argue that black Americans
16
have shaken off ""the inseparable concomitant"" of slavery. No one can argue that the ""ordinary modes"" are now or have been sufficient to protect minorities from invidious discrimination.
In the one hundred and twenty years since the Supreme Court's utopian declaration, we have seen just one generation of multiracial college campuses — the only such generation in our nation's history.20
That novel and radical change in American higher education occurred only because a nonviolent army, emboldened by the end of legalized segregation, arose to challenge segregation's morality as well.
""Army"" is an apt description of that cadre of women and men, because they were literally at war, and as in war, that army suffered many casualties. But it also won many battles — at lunch counters, movie theaters, bus stations and polling places — and eventually, with the passage of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and the Voting Rights Act of 1965, that army finally won the war.
As the nation emerged from the battlefield and the decades of oppression which led up to it, it understood — notwithstanding the Supreme Court pronouncement in 1863 — that the black man deserved ""to be the special favorite of the laws,"" that only in this way could the cycle of discrimination and disadvantage be ended, only in this way could we reduce inequality in income, housing, employment, education and life chances between whites and blacks.
Thus was born ""affirmative action"" — the just spoils of a
17
righteous war.
How, we must ask ourselves, was yesterday's civil rights victory transformed today into a what some argue is a civil rights violation?
First, the growing number of blacks and other minorities and women, pushing for entry into and power in the academy, the media, business, government and other traditionally white male institutions, created a backlash in the discourse over race. The previous privileged majority exploded in angry resentment at having to share space with the formerly excluded.
Opinion leaders began to reformulate and redefine the terms of the discussion. Any indictment of white America could be abandoned. Instead, black behavior — not white racism — became the reason why blacks and whites live in separate worlds. Racism retreated and pathology advanced. The burden of racial problem solving shifted from racism's creators to its victims. The failure of the lesser breeds to enjoy society's fruits became their fault alone. In a kind on nonsensical tautology we heard again and again: those people are poor because they are pathological, they are pathological because they are poor.
While reformers in Western Europe were attacking much of the poverty that afflicted single women and children, in the United States a different paradigm emerged, a different lesson was learned. One social scientist wrote of America:
""Poverty has been artfully reconfigured (there) as a social, cultural, psychological pathology, corroborated by a public discourse of deficiency and remediation.""21

18
Thus, pressure for effective civil rights laws became special pleading. America's most privileged population, white men, configured themselves as a victim class. Aggressive blacks and pushy women became responsible for America's demise.
For some, opposing affirmative action became an organizing principle of their politics.
All this occurred amid a series of public opinion polls demonstrating too many white Americans believe racial minorities are less than equal human beings, lacking in thrift, morality, industriousness and patriotism.22
An organized opposition campaign continues until this day, led by a curious mix of whites and some blacks, academics, journalists and policy makers. Its aim is the demobilization of effective insurgent politics, the depoliticizing of discussions of our gross maldistribution of income, and it uses its arguments to legitimize reactionary and punitive social policy.
Its adherents profess strong support for equal rights while they oppose every tool designed to achieve that goal. They attack and discredit affirmative action, not only because it threatens ancient white-skin privilege, but because its also serves as a handy symbol of despised government intervention.
Republicans found opposition to racial justice and the tools it required especially useful to their success. In election after election, they ""played the race card"", embracing the Confederate flag, using coded language to disparage the different, encouraging a culture of victim-hood among their
19
followers.
Now affirmative action's opponents try to tell us that it does not work, or it used to work but it does not work now, or we used to need it but we do not need it now, or that when it works, it only helps people who do not need it.
It is needed now for the same reasons expressed by Justice Thurgood Marshall twenty-five years ago. He wrote:
""It is because of a legacy of unequal treatment that we must now permit the institutions of this society to give consideration to race in making decisions about who will hold the positions of influence, affluence and prestige in America. For far too long the doors to these positions have been shut to Negroes. If we are ever to become a fully integrated society, one in which the color of a person's skin will not determine the opportunities available to him or her, we must be willing to take steps to open those doors. I do not believe that anyone can truly look into America's past and still find that a remedy for the effects of that past is impermissible.""23

Affirmative action is not about preferential treatment for blacks; it is about removing preferential treatment whites have received through centuries, giving equal treatment to people who were denied equality in the past.
The argument against so-called ""undeserving"" middle and upper class blacks benefiting from affirmative action is heard in tandem with the idea that affirmative action does nothing for the more ""deserving"" working class black population, and that affirmative action does little to help solve problems of teenage pregnancy or drug related crime, that black people's problems are about class, not race.
But affirmative action is not a poverty program and ought
20
not be blamed for failing to solve problems it was not designed to solve, although removing racial bias from employment and education decisions is a superb tool to fight poverty. But bias produced the poverty, not poverty the bias.
Race may be a proxy for poverty, but poverty is not a proxy for race.
The critics' premise is that middle class status — a college degree or a large paycheck — serves as a shield against racism. No one has ever made that same argument about women — that the discrimination they face is based on class, not gender, or that middle class status protects them from the glass ceiling.
Without affirmative action, both white and blue collars around black necks would begin to shrink, with a huge, depressive effect on black income, employment, home ownership and education.
That is because racism is alive and well in America.
In a recent experiment, 5000 resumes were sent in response to help-wanted ads in Boston and Chicago. Each resume was randomly assigned a very black-sounding name or a very white-sounding name.
The resumes from the Emily Walshes and the Brendan Bakers received 50 per cent more callbacks than did the Lakisha Washingtons and the Jamal Joneses.
No group of Americans is more physically isolated from jobs than blacks. More than 1 in 5 blacks trying to rent a home or rent an apartment face illegal discrimination.
And black people face disproportionate surveillance, arrest,
21
and incarceration. One in three black men carries the stigma of being a felon thanks to my nation's racially disparate war on drugs.
This discrimination has measurable costs. Or put another way, eliminating it would have measurable benefits.
But for discrimination, black Americans would have:

2 million more high school degrees;
2 million more college degrees;
700,000 more jobs;

and 700,000 blacks would not be behind bars.
Behind these numbers are names — and obvious benefits for the society at large.
Those who would have us believe that their opposition to affirmative action is rooted in a desire for fairness and equality are engaged in justification, rationalization and prevarication. We have long heard these arguments from white racists — black self-haters join them today too.
The most pernicious myth is that affirmative action's beneficiaries are taking jobs and school placements away from more deserving others. The truth is there are not enough black people in America to pose such a threat, except to those who need justification for their own failures.
One of the most important recent legal developments in the affirmative action arena was Hopwood v. Texas,24 in which an appellate court struck down race-conscious university admissions.
Interestingly, the district court eventually denied damages
22
to the white plaintiffs, finding that none of them would have been admitted even under a ""colorblind"" admissions policy.
And at the University of Michigan, 1400 white and Asian students with lower grade averages than the white complainant were admitted.
A 1998 study found that black students admitted to selective institutions with race-sensitive admissions policies graduate at a higher rate than their peers at less selective institutions.
At Harvard College, about nine out of 10 applicants are denied admission. Fifteen percent of the student body is black or Hispanic. ""Even if every one of these students were forced to surrender his place to a white or Asian student . . . acceptance rates for white and Asian students would increase by only one or two percentage points.""25
Harvard could accommodate more students by denying admission to some legacies, or descendants of graduates; their average entrance examination score is lower than the scores of black students, but no one seems to think they ought to be kept out because they are less deserving.
Class cannot become a substitute for race without resegregation. Again, ""(t)he problem is in the numbers.""26 Although blacks are disproportionately low income compared with whites, a majority (53 percent) of those with family incomes below $20,000 are neither black nor Hispanic.27
In college admissions, ""the main beneficiaries of a color-blind policy emphasizing class disadvantage would be low-income
23
whites and Asians.""
The most recent research
""shows that there is no good substitute for affirmative action admissions efforts targeted at historically excluded groups. Any substitute criteria will be likely to bypass any of the best prepared black and Latino students, who may face many forms of racial discrimination but are neither poor nor isolated in the weakest schools.""28

Look at it in this way: it is a fourth quarter of a football game between the white team and the black team. The white team is ahead 145 to 3. They have been cheating since the game began. The white team owns the ball, the uniforms, the field, the goals, and the referees. There are two minutes left to play. Suddenly the white quarterback, who feels badly about things that happened before he entered the game, turns to the black team and asks, ""Can't we just play fair?""
It is now too late in the game for false fairness; it means freezing the status quo in place, permanently fixing minorities at the bottom of the economic education scale.
As one expert wrote,
""The choice before us now is either the continued use of race conscious policies or the resegregation of American higher education.""

I began by mentioning that the British Navy had introduced affirmative action for cooks in 1776 — just as Britain was fighting to hold onto its colony in America.
Thirty years after the war that brought independence to the new United States, George Washington, our first
24
President, argued for diversity in a proposed national university for men.
He said:
""That which would render (a national university) of the highest importance, in my opinion, is that the Juvenal period of life, when friendships are formed, & habits established that will stick by one; the Youth or young men from different parts of the United States would be assembled together, & would by degrees discover that there was not one cause for those jealousies & prejudices which one part of the union had imbibed against another part ... prejudices are beginning to revive again, and never will be eradicated so effectually by any other means as the intimate intercourse of characters in early life, who, in all probability, will be at the head of the councils of the country in a more advanced stage of it.""29

That was true 200 years ago, and it remains true today.
I am an optimist. It runs in my family. More than 100 years ago, in 1892, my slave born grandfather said:
""The pessimist from his corner looks out on the world of wickedness and sin, and blinded by all that is good or hopeful in the condition and progress of the human race, bewails the present state of affairs and predicts woeful things for the future.""
""In every cloud he beholds a destructive storm, in every flash of lightning an omen of evil and in every shadow that falls across his path a luring foe.""
""But he forgets that the clouds also bring life and hope, that the lightning purifies the atmosphere, that shadow and darkness prepare for sunshine and growth, and that hardships and adversity nerve the race, as the individual, for greater efforts and grander victories.""30

Greater efforts and grander victories. That was his generation's promise 111 years ago. That was the promise made by the generation that won the great world war for democracy six
25
decades ago. That was the promise made by the generation that brought democracy to America's darkest corners four decades ago.
And that is the promise we must seek to honor today.

The practice of law is a profession both admired and despised. Charles Hamilton Houston, who devised the litigation strategy of the NAACP against state-sanctioned segregation and who taught Thurgood Marshall how to practice law, liked to say that a lawyer is ""either a social engineer or a parasite on society.""1
Houston said that black lawyers had five obligations:

to be ""prepared to anticipate, guide and interpret group advancement,""
to be the ""mouthpiece of the weak and a sentinel guarding against wrong,""
to ensure that ""the course of change is ... orderly with a minimum of human loss and suffering,""
to ""use ... the law as an instrument available to (the) minority ... to achieve its place in the community and nation,"" and
to engage in ""a carefully planned (program)"" of ""arousing and strengthening the local will to struggle.""2

A lawyer's job — doing justice — is often a struggle. As Frederick Douglass wisely warned, ""Power concedes nothing without a demand."" And doing justice often means taking power from those who have it and giving it to those who do not.
In this high tech age, we hear a lot about the ""digital divide."" But last year not long ago the ABA Journal ran a piece entitled ""Divided Justice,"" noting, ""Today there are still two views of the law, one black and one white.""3
A survey commissioned by the ABA Journal and the National Bar Association Magazine revealed the divide separating black and white lawyers. When asked about how much racial bias currently
3
exists in the justice system, for example, 52.4% of black lawyers said ""very much"" while only 6.5% of white lawyers agreed.
More than 90% of black lawyers think the justice system is as or more racially biased than other segments of society, an opinion held by fewer than half of white lawyers.
Not surprisingly, almost 67% of black lawyers say they have witnessed racial bias in the justice system within the past three years, while only 16% of white lawyers say they have done so.
In every area surveyed — racial profiling, environmental justice, jury configuration, judicial appointments, law firm diversity, minority law clerks, affirmative action — black and white lawyers stand on opposite sides of a racial divide.
An even more recent study, sponsored by the Justice Department and six major foundations, confirms that black and white youth stand on opposite sides of a justice divide.
At every step in the juvenile justice system, black and Hispanic youths are treated more severely than comparable whites.4 Minority youths are more likely to be arrested, held in jail, sent for trial, convicted, and given longer prison terms.
Among young people charged with a violent crime who have not been in juvenile prison previously, for example, black teenagers are nine times more likely than whites to be sentenced to juvenile prison. Black youths charged with drug offenses are 48 times more likely than their white counterparts to receive such a sentence.
Behind these numbers are names.
In the 1960s, we said ""military justice"" was an oxymoron; now we must say the same about ""juvenile justice.""

Nowhere is the public trust more important than in the justice system. Nowhere, perhaps, is it more difficult to attain.
Trust in public and private institutions has been on the decline in this country for decades, and courts are not immune.
Nor are courts immune from the problems of the larger society in which they function: wealth-based disparities, political favoritism, unfair treatment of racial and ethnic minorities.

So it is not surprising, that, in yet another survey conducted in 2000 between March and May of this last year, respondents' views about the courts in their communities differed am greatly among whites, African Americans, and Latinos. 5
In almost all of [illegible] their assessments of fairness in court outcomes and procedures, blacks [illegible] [illegible] were less favorable than whites, sometimes markedly so.
Among recent court users, for example, whites [illegible] were more than twice as likely as blacks to view court procedures as always or usually fair. The difference between white and black jurors was particularly stark. Although 63% of white jurors believed court outcomes are
5
[illegible]
always or usually fair, only 17% of black jurors shared that perception.
A feeling that courts treat people with respect was stronger among whites.
The lack of trust in the courts among blacks was palpable: a majority of blacks [illegible] expressed the view that their group is treated worse than other groups. 
In American courts, in American law, as in American life, it is race — not class, not gender, but race — that dictates both perception and reality.

For a non-lawyer like me, it is always an honor to appear before lawyers and others in the legal field — as long as it isn't me in a courtroom.
I want to talk about my experiences with — and against — the law.
My first appearance before a judge was in a courtroom, when I was twenty years old.
It was March 1960, during the Jim Crow era. I had led a group of my fellow students to the segregated cafeteria in the basement of Atlanta's City Hall. We passed along the steam table loading our trays, and as first in line, I approached the cashier.
Like most Southerners, she was polite as she told me, ""I'm awfully sorry, but this is for City Hall employees only.""
""But,"" I protested, ""you have a large sign outside that says 'City Hall Cafeteria — the Public is Welcome""'.
""We don't mean it,"" she said, and called the police who came and locked us up.
Because nearly 200 of us had been arrested that day in various locations around Atlanta, it was decided to try one person in each group, and I was chosen to represent mine.
2
For the first time in my life I stood before a judge. On either side of me were two men I had never seen or met before; I quickly understood they were my lawyers.
After some back and forth the judge asked me, ""How do you plead?"" and I was panic-stricken.
On the one hand, I knew I was guilty — the policeman had asked me to leave and I had refused.
But I didn't feel guilty — I knew I had a right to eat in that tax supported cafeteria, and that any law that said I couldn't was no law at all.
I desperately looked to my left where the elder of my two lawyers was standing. He was the dean of black lawyers in Georgia and had risked life and limb for nearly 50 years to represent black people in courthouses in small towns where he'd not dare spend the night; now nearly in his dotage he was asleep on his feet.
I turn frantically to the lawyer on my right who said in a whisper, ""Not guilty, you fool!""
I had the presence of mind to drop those last words or perhaps I'd not be standing here before you now.
I am not a lawyer, but my wife, Pamela Horowitz, as you have heard, is, and she has allowed me to tell you that one of her judicial heroes, and mine, Judge Frank M. Johnson, Jr., dismissed — within hours of its filing — the first lawsuit she ever filed, declaring the complaint to be ""verbose, prolix, and argumentative.""
The dismissal was without prejudice, allowing her to re-file — and eventually, to win — the case, the first of many she would argue before Judge Johnson.
3
Johnson, as you may know, was a profile in judicial courage. A Republican from ""the free state of Winston,"" , a northern Alabama county that voted to secede from Alabama when Alabama seceded from the Union, Johnson spent 24 years as a federal district judge in Montgomery.
As a member of a three-judge court, he ended the Montgomery Bus Boycott by ruling bus segregation unconstitutional. This would be followed by ruling striking down ""segregation and discrimination in every facet of Alabama life — schools, parks, jury selection, higher education, voting, legislative reapportionment.""i
Johnson would place ""Alabama's prison system, highway patrol, property tax assessment program, mental health agency, and public education system all under the federal court's jurisdiction.""ii
Johnson was far from alone in his judicial heroism. As Claude Siton, who served as southern correspondent for The New Yorks Times in the early 1960s, put it:
""Those who think Martin Luther King desegregated the South don't know Elbert Tuttle and the record of the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals.""iii

The Fifth Circuit, to which Johnson would eventually be elevated, then encompassed six states of the Old Confederacy, including Chief Judge Tuttle's and my Georgia.
After the landmark Brown decision struck down school segregation, and with it, the ""separate but equal"" doctrine, Senator James O. Eastland told a cheering audience in Senatobia, Mississippi:
""On May 17, 1954, the Constitution of the United States was destroyed because the Supreme Court disregarded the law and decided that integration was right. You are not required to
4
obey any court which passes out such a ruling. In fact, you are obligated to defy it.""iv
It was in this atmosphere that the Fifth Circuit would be called upon to turn Brown's promise into reality and to expand it beyond the schoolhouse. Its judges would strike down barriers to equality in voting, jury selection, and employment, in the process formulating the remedy of ""affirmative action"" — the just spoils of a righteous war.
At great personal sacrifice, these judges took the nation and the South, from white-robed Klan violence to black-robed justice and helped to save us from ourselves.
They didn't always get it right.
In 1966, I was the plaintiff in a case that grew from my first election to the Georgia House of Representatives.v
A federal lawsuit had reapportioned the Georgia General Assembly, reconstituting a legislature where cows and horses were better represented than human beings.vi
Having created new, equal districts in urban Fulton County, the courts had ordered elections for a one-year term. As a successful candidate for one of those new seats, I was to take the oath of office on January 10, 1966.
A week earlier, Samuel Younge, Jr., a Tuskegee Institute student and a colleague in the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee (SNCC), was shot and killed while trying to use the segregated bathroom at a Tuskegee service station.
He needed to use the bathroom more often than most because during his Navy service, including the Cuban blockade, he had lost a kidney, and the irony of his losing his life because of an illness suffered in service to his country prompted SNCC to issue an anti-war statement.vii
5
We became the first organization to link the prosecution of the Vietnam War with the persecution of blacks at home.
SNCC issued a statement which accused the United States of deception ""in its claims of concern for the freedom of colored peoples in such countries as the Dominican Republic, the Congo, South Africa, Rhodesia, and in the United States itself.""
""The United States is no respecter of persons or laws,"" the statement said, ""when such persons or laws run counter to its needs and desires.""
The statement created a sensation.
I was SNCC's Communications Director, and when I appeared to take the oath of office on January 10, 1966, hostility from white legislators was nearly absolute. They prevented me from taking the oath, declared my seat vacant, and ordered another election to fill vacancy.
I won that election and was expelled again; by the time I approached a third election, this time for a regular two-year term, I had filed suit in federal court.
Judge Griffin Bell wrote the majority decision for the three-judge court which refused to overturn the legislature's decision to deny me the seat to which I had been twice elected.
Judge Tuttle dissented.
His view was adopted by a unanimous United States Supreme Court, and a year after my first attempt, I became a member of the Georgia House of Representatives.
Before the three-judge court, I was represented by Charles Morgan, Jr., then of the Southern Regional Office of the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) and later my wife's law partner, and Howard Moore, later
6
my sister's partner in law and partner in life. For the appeal to the Supreme Court, I secured the services of Victor Rabinowitz and Leonard Boudin.
I had never been to the Supreme Court; as I sat and listened to Georgia's Attorney General Arthur Bolton argue that Georgia had a right to refuse to seat me, I found myself hypnotically nodding in agreement.
Rabinowitz elbowed me and whispered, ""Stop that, you fool,"" not the first time I had been so addressed by my lawyer.
During Bolton's argument, Justice Byron White asked him: ""Is that all you have? You've come all this way and that's all you have?""
I elbowed Rabinowitz and said, ""We're winning, aren't we?"" Indeed we were and did.
Chief Justice Earl Warren's decision in Bond v Floyd was more that a victory for the First Amendment; it was a reaffirmation of my constituents' right to free choice in casting their votes.
And it was a reaffirmation of the centrality of the legal system in our lives.
Lawyers, as Charles Hamilton Houston used to say, can be ""social engineer(s)"" or ""parasite(s) on society.""
Houston, who devised the litigation strategy of the NAACP against state-sanctioned segregation and who taught Thurgood Marshall how to practice law, said a lawyer had five obligations:

to be ""prepared to anticipate, guide and interpret group advancement,""
to be the ""mouthpiece of the weak and the sentinel guarding against wrong,""
to ensure that ""the course of change is ... orderly with a minimum of human loss and suffering,""
to ""use ... the law as an instrument available to (the) minority ... to achieve its place in the community and the nation,"" and
7

to ""engage in a carefully planned (program)"" of ""arousing and strengthening the local will to struggle.""

The NAACP retained Houston as Special Counsel in 1934. He was one of a small group of black lawyers who came of age during the New Deal years.
Although Houston and Marshall, his protégé and successor, are synonymous with the NAACP's litigation success, the organization had pursued an innovative litigation strategy from its inception in 1909.
It was Houston's legal vision that would not only lead the NAACP to its great legal victories but would also ""have a deep and lasting impact on how we think today about public interest law.""viii
A lawyer's or judge's job — doing justice — is often a struggle. As Frederick Douglass wisely warned, ""Power concedes nothing without a demand; it never has and never will.""
And doing justice often means taking power from those who have it and giving it to those who do not.
In this high tech age, we hear a lot about the ""digital divide."" But not long ago, the ABA Journal ran a piece entitled ""Divided Justice,"" noting, ""Today there are still two views of the law, one black and one white.""
A survey commissioned by the ABA Journal and the National Bar Association Magazine revealed the divide separating black and white lawyers. When asked about how much racial bias exists in the justice system, for example, 52% of black lawyers said ""very much"" while only 6% of white lawyers agreed.
More than 90% of black lawyers think the justice system is as or more racially biased than other segments of society, an opinion held by fewer than half of white lawyers.
8
Not surprisingly, almost 67% of black lawyers said they had witnessed racial bias in the justice system within the previous three years, while only 16% of white lawyers said they had done so.
In every area surveyed — racial profiling, environmental justice, jury configuration, judicial appointments, law firm diversity, minority law clerks, affirmative action — black and white lawyers stand on opposite sides of a racial divide.
A more recent study, sponsored by the Justice Department and six major foundations, confirms that black and white youth stand on opposite sides of a justice divide.
At every step in the juvenile justice system, black and Hispanic youth are treated more severely that comparable whites. Minority youth are more likely to be arrested, held in jail, sent for trial, convicted, and given longer prison terms.
Among young people charged with a violent crime who have not been in juvenile prison previously, black teenagers are nine times more likely than whites to be sentenced to juvenile prisons. Black youths charged with drug offenses are 48 times more likely than their white counterparts to receive such a sentence.
Behind these numbers are names.
In the 1960s, we used to say that ""military justice"" was an oxymoron; now we must say the same about ""juvenile justice.""
Nowhere is public trust more important than in the justice system. Nowhere, perhaps, is it more difficult to attain.
Trust in public and private institutions has been on the decline in this country for decades, and courts are not immune.
9
Nor are courts immune from the problems of the larger society in which they function: wealth-based disparities, political favoritism, unfair treatment of racial and ethnic minorities.
So it is not surprising that, in another survey conducted in 2000, respondents' views about the courts in their communities differed greatly among whites, African-Americans, and Latinos.
In almost all of their assessments of fairness in court outcomes and procedures, blacks were less favorable than whites, sometimes markedly so.
Among recent court users, for example, whites were more than twice as likely as blacks to view court procedures as always or usually fair. The difference between white and black jurors was particularly stark: although 63% of white jurors believed court outcomes are always or usually fair, only 17% of black jurors shared that perception.
A feeling that courts treat people with respect was strongest among whites.
A lack of trust in the courts among blacks was palpable: a majority expressed the view that their group is treated worse than others.
And a recent Columbia Law School study found that as the homicide risk for whites rises or surpasses that for blacks, error rates in capital convictions rise too. The higher the number of African-Americans in a state — and in one analysis, the higher the number of welfare recipients in a state — the higher the rate of serious capital error.ix
In American courts, in America law, as in American life, it is race — not class, not gender, but race — that dictates both perception and reality.
Judge Frank Johnson, whom I mentioned earlier, understood this.
He told a Boston University School of Law Commencement in 1979:
10
""Religious differences, race differences, sex differences, age differences and political differences are not the same. It is no mark of intellectual soundness to treat them as if they were. Moreover, if the life of the law has been experience, then the law should be realistic enough to treat certain issues as special: as racism is special in American history. A judiciary that cannot declare that is of little value.""

The removal, over the decades of the 1950s and 1960s, of the more blatant forms of American apartheid, has made it too easy for too many to believe today that all forms of discrimination have disappeared.
Opinion polls reveal that a majority of whites believe that racial discrimination is no longer an impediment for people of color. In one study, 75% of whites said that blacks face no discrimination in obtaining jobs or housing, even as housing discrimination becomes more severe. In another poll, two-thirds of whites said they were ""personally satisfied"" with the way blacks were treated in society.
Polls show that most white Americans believe equal education opportunity exists right now, even as schools become more, not less, segregated across the country.x
Americans disagree about why a lack of diversity persists in our schools and businesses. They disagree about the tools we might use to close the gaps, but an overwhelming majority agrees that achieving diversity is important.
In one recent survey, 8 out of 10 said it was important to have persons of different races, cultures and backgrounds in the workforce. Even more — 85% — thought diversity important to the future of the economy. And 90% thought diversity important to the quality of higher education.xi
11
A few months ago, a majority of the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals said ""that diversity ... has the potential to enrich everyone's education and thus make a law school stronger than the sum of its parts,"" in upholding a race conscious admissions program at the University of Michigan Law School.xii
The dissent proposed that the law school pursue ""experiential diversity in a race-neutral manner"".xiii
I am cited in this dissenting opinion, not — I am happy to say — in favor of this dubious proposition.
The notion of ""race-neutral diversity"" would allow diversity to become a dodge to avoid race, just as has the notion of colorblindness.
As the Dean of Michigan's Law School writes, ""Colorblindness is an ideal, not an idol, and the Constitution does not require us to sacrifice effective education and integration in its name.xiv
Or, as I like to put it, whether race is burden or benefit is all the same to these theorists; that is what they mean when they speak of being color-blind. They are color-blind, all right: blind to the consequences of being the wrong color in America today.
Race not only matters in America today, it remains the central fact of life for every non-white American, eclipsing income, position, gender, and education. Race trumps them all.
The evidence is everywhere.

A study of workplace discrimination found that blacks and whites with equal qualifications were treated equally barely one-quarter of the time.xv 
12

A nationwide study of homebuyers found that minorities face increased discrimination from mortgage lending institutions.xvi
A sweeping five-year study concluded that race still determines success in everything from job opportunities to education to housing.xvii

The average black family has only eight cents in net worth for every dollar a white family has. Today, the net financial assets of black families in which one member has a college degree are lower than the assets of a white family in which the highest level of education achieved is graduation from elementary school.
While the nation as a whole is more racially and ethnically diverse than at any time in its history, white Americans still choose to live largely segregated lives. Most white Americans have little contact with racial minorities. The 2000 Census shows that the average white-city- or suburb dweller lives in a neighborhood that is 80% white. Conversely, despite years of segregated housing and red-lining, Blacks, Hispanics and Asians all live in more integrated neighborhoods than do whites.
More than one-half of all minorities live in just five states: California, Texas, New York, Florida and Illinois. Fifty-five percent of blacks live in the South. Sixty-one percent of Hispanics live in five Southwestern states. Among Asians and Pacific Islanders, half live in the West, as do half of all Indians, Eskimos, and Aleuts.
With the emergence of more multi-racial and multi-ethnic neighborhoods comes confirmation that not all differences are created equal. Segregation among Latinos and Asians is often transitory, an immediate by-product of immigration. Black segregation is different and longer lasting,
13
tending toward the permanent. One-race concentrations of 80 to 90 percent occur almost exclusively in black neighborhoods. The reason? Only in the case of blacks do all whites flee.
""Black-white segregation,"" as one expert says, ""is, in some ways at least, a different phenomenon.""
The reasons why are rooted in the Confederacy; its Vice-President said, ""Its foundations are laid on the great truth that the Negro is not equal to the white man; that slavery, subordination to the superior race, is his natural and moral condition.""
After the Civil War ended legal slavery, dictatorial constraints, supported by state-sponsored and private brutality, prevent African-American mobility.
No other ethnic group, with the exception of American Indians, experienced a comparable mix of xenophobic attitudinal and structural limitations on their development. It is absolutely without parallel in the American experience.
Our lives may reflect this, but our laws do not. Today, through Executive Order, court decisions, and legislative acts, the protected classes extend to a majority of all Americans, including white ethnics, the aged, short people, the chemically dependent, the left-handed, the obese, and all religions. We ought to examine how the road to civil rights became so crowded, and what the consequences are.
Race is a socio-political, not a biological construct; there are more differences within races than between them. But if race has only socio-political, not biological significance, it isn't just a pigment of our imagination; it colors all our lives and it has profound consequences in the lives of many.
14
It is part of our history, and like all history, the past informs and shapes the present.
Two hundred and forty-six years of American slavery were followed by 100 years of state-sanctioned discrimination, reinforced by public and private terror and brutality, ending only after a protracted struggle in 1965.
Just as the black man was only 35 years removed from slavery at the beginning of the 20th century, so was the black man only 35 years removed from segregation when the 21st century began.
As we meet here today, it has only been 38 short years since all black Americans were promised the full rights of citizens, only 38 years since legal segregation was ended nationwide, only 38 years since the right to register and vote was universally guaranteed, only 38 years since the protections of the law and Constitution were officially guaranteed to all.
And now some tell us that those 38 years have been enough.
To believe that is the victory of hope over experience.
To believe that is the victory of self-delusion over common sense.
Those who declare that yesterday's civil rights movement wiped the slate clean clearly do not understand the present. Those who claim no connection with our history do not understand the past.
As historian John Hope Franklin writes:
""All whites ... benefited from American slavery. All blacks had no rights they could claim as their own. All whites, including the vast majority who owned no slaves, were not only encouraged but authorized to exercise dominion over all slaves, thereby adding to the system of control.
... Even poor whites benefited from the legal advantage they enjoyed over all blacks as well as from the psychological advantage of having a group beneath them.
Most living Americans do have a connection with slavery. They have inherited the preferential advantage, if they are white,
15
or the loathsome disadvantage, if they are black, and these positions are virtually as alive today as they were in the 19th Century.""
Considering our history, the job done so far has been remarkable, no matter how long the journey has been, no matter how great the task that remains undone.
One of the tools which helps eliminate slavery's legacy is affirmative action, created to fight what Supreme Court Justice Sandra O'Connor called ""the unhappy persistence of both the practice and the lingering effects of racial discrimination."" Affirmative action is now under attack not because it has failed but because it has succeeded.
It created the sizable middle class that constitutes one-third of all black Americans today, women and men with jobs and homes and education. In the late 1960s, the wages of black women in the textile industry tripled. From 1970 to 1990, the number of black police officers, doctors and lawyers doubled; black electricians and college students tripled; black bank tellers more than quadrupled.
Some argue that affirmative action carries a stigma which attaches to all blacks, beneficiaries or not — as if blacks suffered no stigma before the words ""affirmative action"" were ever uttered.
Why is this argument never made about the millions of whites who got into college as a ""legacy"" because Dad was an alumnus? Or who got a good job because Dad was President of the company — or President of the United States?
You never see them walking around, heads held low, moaning that everyone in the executive washroom is whispering about how they got their
16
job. No one suggests that white women, affirmative action's greatest beneficiaries, are suffering any crisis of self-confidence.
Since the nation was founded, all our elite professions have been the special preserve of white men — and they remain so today, from membership in the House and Senate to the heads of Fortune 500 companies to the tenured faculty at the nation's college and universities to partnerships at major law firms.
I seriously doubt if a single one of these men is suffering from low self-esteem because he knows his race and gender helped him win his job.
Most pernicious is the myth that affirmative action's black beneficiaries are taking jobs and school placements away from more deserving others. The truth is there are not enough black people in America to pose such a threat, except to those seeking justification for their own failures.
At Harvard College, about nine of every ten applicants is denied admission. Fifteen percent of the students are black or Hispanic. Even if every one of these students were forced to surrender his or her place to a white or Asian student ... acceptance rates for whites and Asians would increase by only one or two percentage points.
Harvard could accommodate more students by denying admission to some legacies whose average SAT scores fall below those of black students. But no one seems to think the children of alumni should be kept out because they are less deserving.
The Bush family has enjoyed three generations of preferential admissions to Yale University. They seem to have shouldered no shame from knowing lineage, as much as knowledge, helped them win precious seats in a prestigious college.
17
President Bush unfortunately chose Martin Luther King's birthday to announce his administration would oppose Michigan's efforts to achieve a diverse student body. He called the Michigan program a ""quota"", which it is not, and his use of this racially charged word is evidence of the bias he brought to his decision.
He complained that minority candidates are given extra points toward admission, not because of ""life experience"", he said, but because of race. But in America, life experience determined by race.
The Bush Administration likes to use Secretary of State Colin Powell and National Security Advisor Condoleeza Rice as human shields against any criticism of their record on civil rights. After all, as Bush is proud of saying, his administration is more diverse than any in history — except the one that preceded it.
But the day after the Administration filed its brief in the Michigan case, Ms. Rice issued a rare statement on a domestic issue, saying ""(I)t is appropriate to use race as one factor among others in achieving a diverse student body."" And she has acknowledged that affirmative action was responsible for her employment at Stanford University.
Secretary Powell has long been an advocate for affirmative action, and has said he hopes the University of Michigan prevails in court.
Corporate America hopes so too, which is why dozens of Fortune 500 companies have filed friend of the court briefs in the Michigan case.
Look at it this way — it is the fourth quarter of a football game between the black team and the white team. The white team is ahead 145 to 3. They have been cheating since the game began. The white team owns the ball, the uniforms, the field, the goalposts, and the referees. There are two minutes left to play. All of a sudden, the white quarterback — who feels
18
badly about things that happened before he entered the game — turns to the black team and says, ""Say fellows, can't we just play fair?""
Of course, ""fair"" here is farce; it is double-speak for freezing the status quo in place, permanently fixing inequality as part of the American scene.
As one of the judges in the Michigan case said, ""Diversity in education, at its base, is the desegregation of a historically segregated population, and ... Bakke and Brown must therefore be read together so as to allow a school to consider race or ethnicity in its admissions for many reasons .…""xviii
[The following handwritten paragraph appears at the bottom of the page, with an arrow indicating insertion in this location.]
Bakke, as you know, remains the law of the land today, making the recent actions of Virginia Tech's Board of Visitors exceedingly all the more perverse.
I not only have spent most of my adult life in the cause of integration, but in 1947, when I was 7 years old — I was a plaintiff in a lawsuit in rural Pennsylvania against segregated schools.
As the suit was pending, the school board tried to settle by giving achievement tests to decide which of two schools on opposite sides of a country lane students would attend; most blacks failed and all whites passed. The schools remained segregated until the sons of the local white political boss failed the test. Rather than send them to the black school, that school was closed, and all of Lincoln University Village's children went to a two-room school together.
Recently I visited Berea College in Kentucky, opened by abolitionists as an integrated school in 1855. It was closed by the Civil War, but opened again in 1866 with 187 students — 96 blacks and 91 whites. It dared to provide a rare commodity in the former slave states — an education open to all — blacks and whites, women and men.
19
One of those early students was my grandfather, James Bond, born a slave, who at age 15, barely able to read and write, hitched his tuition — a steer — to a rope, and walked miles across Kentucky to enter Berea.
Berea maintained an integrated student body until the 1900s, when the Kentucky legislature passed a law forbidding the mixing of the races in the state's schools and collegesxix. The United States Supreme Court upheld the Kentucky law in 1908,xx forcing Berea to choose which students it would educate — it chose to become all white.
My grandfather belonged to a transcendent generation of black Americans, born into slavery, freed by the Civil War, determined to make their way as free women and men. From Berea, he studied for the ministry, married, and had six children — one of them my father, Horace Mann Bond.
My father graduated from Pennsylvania's Lincoln University and won a doctorate in education from the University of Chicago. For him too, education was a means to a larger end — the uplift of his people and the salvation of his race.
My father was asked to contribute to the NAACP's brief in Brown v. Board of Education. He pursued this task with the optimism expressed by his father many years before.
When his father, my grandfather James, graduated from Berea, the college asked him to deliver the commencement address.
He said then:
""The pessimist from his corner looks out on the world of wickedness and sin, and blinded by all that is good or hopeful in the progress of the human race, bewails the present state of affairs and predicts woeful things for the future.""
In every cloud he beholds a destructive storm, in every flash of lightning an omen of evil, and in every shadow that falls across his path a lurking foe.""
20
""He forgets that the clouds also bring life and hope, that lightning purifies the atmosphere, that shadow and darkness prepare for sunshine and growth, and the hardships and adversity nerve the race, as the individual, for greater efforts and grander victories.""xxi

""Greater efforts and grander victories."" That was the promise made by the generation born in slavery more than a century and a half ago. That was the promise made by the generation that brought democracy to America's darkest corners almost four decades ago, and that is the promise we must all seek to honor today.

This year's convention theme — Freedom Under Fire — is appropriate in many ways. So too is the city and state in which we gather.
Texas grows presidents — from the mighty oak of civil rights, Lyndon Baines Johnson, to Bushes.
Texas has given birth to legal precedents which make up our legacy, such as Smith v. Allwright and Sweatt v. Painter, and to those which seek to destroy that legacy, such as Hopwood v. Texas.
This state is home to almost twice as many anti-government militia groups as any other state in America. It has the second highest number of both blacks and Hispanics of any state in the country. It has recorded the highest number of executions in the country this year — more than half of the national total. And 66% of the people on death row here are people of color.
And Texas and Houston both have a rich NAACP history.
Houston has long had a pool of well-educated black professionals and entrepreneurs and a vibrant black community which exercised independence
2
and strength. One hundred years ago, black Houston boasted 9 lawyers, 4 dentists, 16 doctors, 10 real estate agents, 5 newspapers, 30 restaurants and 40 stores.
The Houston NAACP Branch is 90-years strong this year. As one historian writes, ""If black Houstonians and Texans were anything, they were organized!""
And they were quick to act when their rights were restricted or threatened, when freedom was under fire.
In January 1921, when the City Democratic Executive Committee adopted a resolution excluding black voters from the upcoming primary, the black leadership of Houston promptly sued.
It would take four United States Supreme Court cases and 23 years, but in the end they would emerge victorious. They would win because of what was described as ""the only organized body financially equipped and possessing the legal expertise to launch a sustained attack on the white primary"" — the NAACP.
From Charles Love and H. L. Davis, who were plaintiffs in the first lawsuit, to Julius White and Dr. William Drake, who filed suit in 1938, the hall of heroes in the fight against the white primary is large and luminous:

J. Alston Atkins and Carter Wesley;
NAACP field worker Daisy Lampkin who helped re-organize the Houston Branch in the late 1930s;
Albert Lucas, elected Branch President in 1939;
Lulu White, the first full-time salaried Executive Secretary of the Houston Branch;
R. R. Grovey and Sidney Hasgett;
3

And Lonnie Smith, a Houston dentist and Branch Vice-President who would become the name plaintiff in Smith v. Allwright, the 1944 Supreme Court case that finally finished the white primary in Texas and throughout the land.

All of them were propelled by the belief, which we share today, that a voteless people are a hopeless people. They suffered many setbacks and disappointments, as have we, but they persevered.
What better place than here, what better time than now to honor them — by vowing to turn out in massive numbers in November and cast our votes.
They remind us that freedom isn't free — it takes strategy, organization, and hard work.
In 1940, black Texans had already been fighting to end the white primary for almost 20 years. That was the year Arthur Spingarn became President of the NAACP and William Hastie accepted the Chairmanship of the National Legal Committee.
That was the year that Houston NAACP leaders issued a call to blacks across Texas and to national NAACP officials to attend the Annual Conference of Branches in Corpus Christi. There, they met with Thurgood Marshall and drew up a ten-year plan. Their chief goal was to eliminate white supremacy from Texas' Democratic primaries.
The Houston Informer, whose staff had voted unanimously to take out an institutional membership in the NAACP, reported that the conference decided to ask all black Texans to contribute to the legal fund.
They raised the money. They filed suit. Then, because of an intervening Supreme Court decision, they had to drop their case and start over. Julius White was said to have warned Thurgood Marshall that if he didn't win the next case he'd better ""not return to Texas.""
4
He won the next case — and we've come back to Texas!
We return under circumstances eerily similar to those facing black Americans during the Smith v. Allwright years — 1940 through 1945.
Then, as now, the nation was at war.
Freedom was under fire then as it is now — at home and abroad.
Then, as now, we fought for freedom on two fronts — on foreign battlefields and on American soil.
Then, the NAACP and the Crisis took every opportunity to connect the struggle for racial equality at home to the democratic ideology that powered the Allied forces. Black newspapers used the war emergency ""to persuade, embarrass, compel and shame our government and our nation"" into a more enlightened attitude toward race.
Today's times require no less — in fact, they insist on more.
The same year Smith v. Allwright was decided, in 1944, a black corporal was traveling from an Army camp in Arizona to one in Louisiana. He wrote about his experiences:
""The only place we could be served was at the railroad station, but of course we had to go into the kitchen. ... about two dozen German prisoners of war, with two American guards, came to the station. They sat at the tables, had their meals served, talked, smoked, in fact had a swell time. I stood on the outside looking on, and I could not help but ask myself these questions: are we not American soldiers, sworn to fight and die if need be for our country? Then why are they treated better than we? Why does the government allow such things to go on?""

The black Americans who fought World War II returned home determined to make democracy safe for America, to fight as fiercely for freedom here as they had abroad. They had fought for a country that would
5
not fight for them. When they came home, democracy was standing on its head, and they helped turn it right side up.
As they did, they proved once again that black people are profoundly American, deeply committed to the values on which America was founded — even as those values remained a distant dream.
As Langston Hughes, whose centennial we celebrate this year, wrote:
""Oh yes, I say it plain, America never was America to me, and yet I swear this oath: America will be!""

Or today, when another poet, Ray Charles, sings ""America the Beautiful"" you know he's never seen the ""spacious skies"" or the ""amber waves of grain."" He's never seen the ""the purple mountain majesties.""
Ray Charles has never seen the ""fruited plain"", but he's singing about an America he knows is out there, an America he knows can exist. That's the America we've fought and died for all these years.i That's our American dream.
We know America's twin towers — freedom and justice — are still standing. It is our job to keep upright what others would weaken or destroy. America is strongest when she is just; she is fiercest when her people are free.
Those who died on September 11 were a diverse group. Most were Americans, but they died with people from more than 50 other countries, from Chile through Zimbabwe.
That's why they called it the World Trade Center.
Among the Americans were blacks, whites, Latinos, Asians, Christians, Muslims and Jews — as diverse in death as we are in life.
6
One of those who escaped from the World Trade Center said, ""If you had seen what it was like in that stairway, you'd be proud. There was no gender, no race, (and) no religion. It was everyone, ... helping each other.""ii
But away from that stairway, back in America's streets, there is gender, there is race, there is religion. Since the attacks, people who look like Arabs or Muslims have been harassed, assaulted, even killed.
On the Saturday following that terrible Tuesday, in Mesa, Arizona, a gunman shot to death the Sikh owner of a gas station and fired on a Lebanese clerk at work and an Afghan family at home. When he was arrested, the suspect said, ""I'm a patriot. I'm a damn American all the way.""iii
What he really is is a damn fool.
Less than a week after the attacks, President George W. Bush stood in his stocking feet at the Washington Islamic Center and vowed to prevent hate crimes and discrimination against Arabs and Muslims in the wake of the attacks. The Administration's two stated goals — retaliation against terrorists abroad and promotion of tolerance here at home — are also reminiscent of the Double V campaign waged by blacks during World War II — victory against fascism abroad and racism at home.
With the events of September 11 we realize we have not yet achieved either victory — not yet against tyranny abroad, not yet against racism here at home.
Just as this enemy — terrorism — is more difficult to identify and punish, so is discrimination a more elusive target today.
And just as we know a lot about discrimination, we know a lot about terrorism too.
As Vernon Jordan said recently:
7
""Slavery was terrorism, segregation was terrorism, the bombing of four little girls in Sunday school was terrorism. ... And we know that the surest defense against terrorism is affirmation of America's basic values.""

We learned that lesson long ago, on the eve of America's entry into World War I, in 1918.
One of our founders, W. E. B. DuBois, swept up in the emotionalism and passion that patriotism sometimes brings, asked black people to quiet our voices and quash our complaints.
""We will forget our special grievances,"" he said, ""and close ranks shoulder to shoulder with our fellow citizens and the allied nations that are fighting for democracy.""
The criticism he faced was immediate and loud. He quickly realized his call for retreat from our rights was terribly wrong. He understood then — as we must today — that when wars are fought to save democracy, the first casualty is usually democracy itself.
So both because of and in spite of the war against terrorism, we will insist on our right to dissent, to petition our government for a redress of our grievances.
We do so as patriots, not as partisans.
To do otherwise would be a denial of the democracy we are defending, a repudiation of the rights we revere.
What Martin Luther King, Jr. once said about communism we can say about terrorism now:
""Our greatest defense ... is to take offensive action in behalf of justice. We must with positive action seek to remove the conditions of poverty, insecurity, and injustice which are the
8
fertile soil in which the seed of (terrorism) grows and develops.""
The world doesn't need more weapons and walls; it needs less intolerance, ignorance, and disease. We don't need more tax cuts; we need fewer tax cheats in corporate suites.
The police and intelligence agencies don't need more powers; they need more professionalism.
But we are seeing freedom shrink and fear expand.
We have a President who owes his election more to a dynasty than to democracy. When he spoke to our convention in Baltimore in 2000, he promised to enforce the civil rights laws. We knew he was in the oil business — we just didn't know it was snake oil.
We have an Attorney General who is a cross between J. Edgar Hoover and Jerry Falwell. [Bond is referring to John Ashcroft.]
And too often one political party is shameless and the other is spineless.
Only one Senator — Russell Feingold of Wisconsin — voted against the first hastily prepared and ill-considered terrorism measure proposed after September 11. He explained his vote this way:
""If we lived in a country that allowed the police to search our home at any time for any reason; if we lived in a country that allowed the government to open your mail, eavesdrop on your phone conversations, or intercept your email communications; if we lived in a country that allowed the government to hold people in jail indefinitely based on what they write or think, or based on mere suspicion that they are up to no good, then the government would no doubt discover and arrest more terrorists. But that probably would not be a country in which we would want to live.""iv

9
Nor do we want to live in a country that permits surveillance and infiltration of religious and political organizations. Yet, the new FBI guidelines announced by J. Edgar Ashcroft do just that.
Just as we remember J. Edgar Hoover, we remember his counter-intelligence program, called COINTELPRO.
And whose intelligence did they want to counter?
In a program called ""Racial Matters"", the FBI tried to disrupt the civil rights movement. They wanted to smear Martin Luther King, Jr. They not only wanted him discredited, they wanted him dead, threatening him with the release of damaging information if he did not commit suicide.
The excuse for COINTELPRO was the perceived threat of communism.
We thought we had put a stop to Hoover's program of spies and lies in the 1970s after its abuses were exposed. Now, under the guise of fighting terrorism, the FBI is going back to spying on law-abiding citizens.
The CIA and the FBI kept files on me in the 1960s; they may be keeping files on me today. But while they watched and followed and photographed and wiretapped those of us working nonviolently in the freedom movement, a wave of white terrorism was sweeping across the South nearly unchallenged. It has taken 40 years to bring a pitiful few of the terrorists of that period to justice.
There is nothing the FBI could not do before September 11 that they need to do now in order to bring today's terrorists to justice or prevent another attack. And there's every reason to keep them from returning to the discredited policies of the past.
They also want to return to the more recently discredited technique of racial profiling. Its return was heralded by Senator Dianne Feinstein (D. -
10
Ca.), who claimed ""the racial profiling debate has (had) ... a chilling impact on the FBI.""v
American white men commit most domestic, homegrown terrorism — does the name Timothy McVeigh ring a bell? Or what about racially profiling white male multi-millionaires like Houston's own 'Kenny-boy' Lay or the executives of WorldCom or Tyco?
We know all about crime in the streets — who's protecting us from crime in the suites?
While the Administration is busy asserting sweeping police powers over the American people, it is sweeping voting rights violations from the 2000 election under the rug.
The Justice Department whittled eleven thousand election complaints down to five potential lawsuits, including a mere three in Florida.
Those focus on Florida's failure to provide language assistance to Spanish- and Creole-speaking voters in three counties.
We support language-assistance to voters, but most of the thousands of black Floridians who were denied the right to vote speak English. The margin of their disenfranchisement surpassed the margin of victory for candidate Bush.vi The margin of the Justice Department's cynicism is surpassed only by their hostility to civil rights.
When you take the JUST - J-U-S-T — out of JUSTICE, that leaves I-C-E — ICE.
So let us say in plain English — Florida will freeze over before you freeze us out!
African-American voters turned out in massive numbers in 2000, and in 2002 we're going to do it again.
Freedom isn't free, and those who oppose it will pay a price.
11
The failure to uphold voting rights is only one example of promises made and promises broken. It is part of Attorney General Ashcroft's failure to uphold his sworn duty to enforce the civil rights laws.
We know he is offended by naked justice.
He has sought to undo the work of career lawyers in the Civil Rights Division. He even tried to release the notorious Adam's Mark Hotel chain from the decree designed to remedy their egregious discrimination against black guests.
Among those staffing the Voting Rights Section in the Department of Justice is a lawyer who helped run the purge of Florida's voter rolls. Another is a former senior counsel for the misnamed Center for Equal Opportunity, founded by Linda Chavez to, in its own words, ""counter the divisive impact of race conscious public policies.""vii
Hers is but one of the many organizations dedicated to overturning the gains of the civil rights movement which are now dictating public policy.
Their very names — the Institute for Justice, the Campaign for a Color Blind America, the American Civil Rights Institute — are fraudulent, and their aims are frightening.
They have already stolen our vocabulary, and they want to steal the spoils of our righteous war. Sophisticated and well funded, over the past decade they have scored several victories in their plot to dismantle affirmative action.
Now as George W. Bush has ascended to the presidency, they have ascended to unprecedented positions of power within the federal government.
Their leading legal organization is the Federalist Society. John Ashcroft served on the Board of its St. Louis chapter. Theodore Olson, now
12
Solicitor General, who litigated the Hopwood case ending affirmative action at the University of Texas, was President of the Washington, DC, lawyers' chapter of the Federalist Society. Larry Thompson, Deputy Attorney General, served on the Board of its Atlanta lawyers' chapter.
There is a right wing conspiracy, and it is operating out of the United States Department of Justice. And the Office of White House Counsel. And the United States Commission on Civil Rights — where Jennifer Braceras, formerly on the Executive Committee of the so-called Civil Rights Practice Group of the Federalist Society, now sits. She and others have set their sights not only on affirmative action, but also on Title IX, the 30-year-old law guaranteeing gender equity in higher education.
Gerald Reynolds, Bush's head of the Office of Civil Rights in the Department of Education, has the same agenda and the same background — vice-chair of the Federalist Society's Civil Rights Practice Group.
There is an even wider conspiracy than this — an interlocking network of funders, groups, and activists, who coordinate their methods and their message.
They are the money, the motivation, and the movement behind vouchers, the legal assault on affirmative action and other remedies for discrimination, attempts to reapportion us out of office, and attacks on equity everywhere.
They've had a collection of black hustler and hucksters on their payrolls for more than twenty years, promoting them as the new generation of black leaders.
They can't deal with the leaders we choose for ourselves — so they manufacture, promote, and hire new ones. Like ventriloquist's dummies,
13
they speak in their puppet master's voice, but we can see his lips move and we can hear his money talk.
They've financed a conservative constellation of make-believe black organizations, all of them hollow shells with more names on the letterhead than there are people on the membership rolls.
They're purchasing seats at the table of influence, and they're buying blacks at a few bucks a head.viii
They want to constitutionally prohibit any governmental consideration of race and thereby do away with many of our rights and much of the legacy of the NAACP.ix
It was here in Texas, in 1945, that Heman Marion Sweatt attempted to enroll at the law school of the University in Austin, part of a carefully conceived attack by the NAACP on segregated education in the South. When the Supreme Court decided Sweatt v. Painter in 1950, it ended segregation in the nation's law schools, opening their doors.
Forty-six years later, as part of a carefully conceived attack by right-wing organizations against affirmative action, the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit, in Hopwood v. Texas, slammed shut the doors the NAACP had opened.
The Supreme Court has yet to weigh in on university admissions. Weeks ago, the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals upheld affirmative action at the University of Michigan Law School.x
As the Law School Dean wrote, ""Colorblindness is an ideal, not an idol, and the Constitution does not require us to sacrifice effective education and integration in its name.""xi
Or, as I like to put it, whether race is a burden or a benefit is all the same to these theorists; that is what they mean when they speak about being
14
color-blind. They are color-blind all right — blind to the consequences of being the wrong color in America today.
What they really want is to get rid of race; don't ask about it; don't count it.
Ward Connerly, affirmative action's poster child, is at it again. He was the fraud behind California's anti-affirmative action initiative, Proposition 209, which read: ""The state shall not discriminate against ... any individual or group on the basis of race.""
Sounds great, doesn't it?
Twenty-seven percent of blacks in California voted for Proposition 209. Exit polls showed that 27% of the Proposition's supporters thought they were voting for affirmative action, not against it.
Coincidence? Not likely.
Now, con-man Connerly is behind the deceptively titled Racial Privacy Initiative, which will prohibit any California public agency — except the police — from collecting racial data, and thereby eviscerate civil rights enforcement.
As long as race counts, we have to count race. Not counting means not knowing how many black or white children do well or poorly in school. Not knowing how many black or Hispanic or Asian or white men or women work in what jobs at what pay. Not knowing how many minority youngsters are sentenced to longer jail terms.
What Ward Connerly will do — unless California's voters stop him — is to institutionalize the denial of different outcomes dictated by race.
We must work to defeat this insidious initiative — and to defeat the larger goals of those who want to privatize racism.
15
Freedom isn't free — it takes strategy, organization, mobilization, coalition and hard work.
We must also work to defeat predatory lending and its evil cousin, payday lending. We spend a lot of energy insuring that minorities can build wealth; we cannot let these pirates steal the little wealth we have, or allow them to prey on the poor.
Thanks to the Supreme Court, we now have to stop voucher programs at the state and local level. Vouchers are public welfare for private schools, and we know they are opposed by a majority of Americans, including African-Americans.xii
President Bush made a speech supporting vouchers in Cleveland on Monday, standing at a podium surrounded by black people, speaking to an audience that was nearly all white. He compared the Supreme Court's ruling in the voucher case to our victory in Brown v. Board of Education 48 years ago.
The difference, Mr. President, is that freedom loving people and the NAACP fought for Brown; today, freedom loving people and NAACP are fighting against transferring tax dollars to private schools.
There's growing hostility to redressing discrimination and closing opportunity gaps through legal or legislative remedies. There is a ""judicial assault"" on civil rights led by the narrow five member Supreme Court majority and some lower federal courts. They're taking us back to the dark and dangerous days of the Dixiecrats, challenging the authority of Congress to enact civil rights protections.""xiii
The most important qualification for Executive and judicial appointments seems to be an absolute lack of experience in civil rights — or better yet antagonism to the accepted remedies for discrimination.
16
We must continue to monitor judicial nominees and defeat those who are unacceptable; we picked off Charles Pickering, but he's only one of a long list of undesirable nominees — we've got to stop them too.
We must also work to end felony disenfranchisement. One hundred and thirty-one thousand black men in Texas alone cannot vote because of felony convictions — 21% of the black male population in this state.
We've got to defend affirmative action. The opponents of fairness keep telling us that affirmative action carries a stigma which attaches to all blacks — as if none of us ever felt any stigma in the days before affirmative action was born.
Why don't they ever make this argument about the millions of whites who got into Harvard or Yale because Dad was an alumnus? Or who got a good job because Dad was president of the company — or President of the United States? You never see them walking around with their heads held low, moaning that everyone in the executive washroom is whispering about how they got their jobs. Most of our elite professions have long been the near-exclusive preserve of white men. I seriously doubt if a single one of these men is suffering low self-esteem because he knows his race and gender won him his job.
And we've got to insure a massive turnout of minority voters in this year's elections — our future is on the ballot in every state. If we don't vote, we lose — and our children and grandchildren will lose too.
We have much to do — economic inequality is widening. The remedies we've used to address racial inequality are under attack.
None of our work is easy work, but we have always been equal to the task. And this year — for the first time in NAACP history — we know exactly who we are.
17
Last year, your NAACP Board of Directors commissioned the first scientific survey of NAACP members. We've known for years that we get high approval ratings from African-Americans in survey after survey, year after year.xiv
But we didn't know what our members thought about their organization. Here's some of what we found out.
Six of every ten NAACP members are female and eight of every ten are black. Twenty percent are under 35 years of age, 30% over 65. Half of us live in cities, while 35% live in suburbs. Fully 30% of us have advanced degrees, and 49% have white-collar jobs. Half of us earn between $30,000 and $100,000 a year, and 20% earn more than $100,000.
We belong to the NAACP because membership carries prestige and because we meet people of similar interests, but mostly because we want to fight racial discrimination and we believe in racial justice.
In short, we are a force to be reckoned with — we are well educated, well informed, and strongly committed to social justice. And we vote!
In 2001, your Board of Directors and Senior NAACP staff produced our first-ever Strategic Plan; last year at the Convention in New Orleans, you endorsed it unanimously. In January 2002, we began to implement it, and in May, the Board heard progress reports from staff.
There is much good news from within the NAACP. We're planning our work — and we're working our plan.xv
It is particularly appropriate in Texas to say — as we always do — that at the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, we believe colored people come in all colors. Anyone who shares our values and mission is more than welcome.
18
As we launch this year's convention, let us remember another time when freedom was under fire.
In 1844, James Russell Lowell wrote ""The Present Crisis"" in opposition to the proposed annexation of Texas to the United States as a slave state.
That poem, more than 150 years old, speaks to us now:
""Once to every man and nation,
Comes the moment to decide.
In the strife of truth and falsehood,
For the good or evil side.
Some great cause, God's new Messiah,
Off'ring each the bloom or blight.
And the choice goes by forever
Twixt that darkness and that light.
Though the cause of evil prosper,
Yet 'tis truth alone is strong.
Though her portion be the scaffold
And upon the throne be wrong.
Yet that scaffold sways the future,
And behind the dim unknown
Stands God within the shadow,
Keeping watch above His own.""

I want to talk about the historic relationship between American blacks and Jews. The civil rights movement whose history I teach represents the highest and best collaboration between blacks and Jews toward a common goal. Today that cooperation is threatened by a variety of forces, including increased conservatism from some American Jews and increasingly vocal anti-semites in black America.
Most prominent is the controversy engendered by Nation of Islam Minister Louis Farrakhan in his attacks on Jews as slavemasters and exploiters of black America, and their repetition of the old and long-discredited libel about a Jewish Master Plan for world domination.
The facts are that Jews were a small, small percentage of slave-holders and a small percentage of merchants in the slave trade, but the libel persists nonetheless. The facts are that the so-called ""Master Plan"" is another libel, a deliberate if long-standing fabrication.
The good news is that a recent report of the Foundation for Ethnic Understanding says that among blacks and Jews, cooperation far outweighed conflict.1
The bad news is that the locus of most anti-semitism in the United States isn't minor fringe groups in black America; it is most pronounced and most widely distributed in the extremes of the overwhelmingly white Christian right, whose attacks on Jews and non-Christians in America does much to fuel hatred and division.
For example, the Rev. Donald Wildmon of the American Family Association, which claims 700 chapters and 600,000 members, recently published a report charging that 59% of all media professionals are Jewish; this figure, he charges, accounts for ""anti-Christian bias"" in the media.2
Anti-abortion groups like Operation Rescue list ""Jewish Doctors"" as the leaders performers of abortion. Thousands of private Christian schools and Christian home schools use anti-Semitic textbooks, including the 'original' McGuffey's Reader and books published by Bob Jones University for use in Christian schools.
""A few of you don't like Jews and I know why,"" the Rev. Jerry Falwell said. ""He can make more money accidentally than you can make on purpose.""
The Rev. Bailey Smith wonders, ""I don't know why God chose the Jew. They have such funny noses. God,"" the Rev. Smith said, ""does not hear the prayers of a Jew.""3
A recent national public opinion survey revealed that a majority of Americans believe minorities are the majority. According to the Gallup Poll, the average American thinks that 18% of all Americans are Jewish; the real figure is 3%. The average Americans thinks that 21% of all Americans are Hispanic; the real figure is 8%. Most Americans think that 32% of all Americans are black; the exact number is 12%. These imagined percentages of minorities add up to 71% of the total population.
The same survey finds that white Americans believe that blacks and Hispanics are lazier and less patriotic than whites, Jews a little less lazy and a little more patriotic; neither blacks nor Jews can find much comfort in these findings.
This common status as victims and objects of disdain has not prevented the relationship between blacks and Jews from fragmenting. More than three four decades after the coalition of blacks and Jews helped to pass the Civil Rights Act of 1964, we cannot afford to let the coalition of conscience come undone.
If there was ever a time when the relationship between blacks and Jews ought to be examined and strengthened with honest admissions on both sides, that time is now.
Any division is tragic. It threatens a progressive coalition as old as the 20th century, a tradition that has humanized American politics, a relationship of intersecting agendas based on religious faith. Black and Jewish agendas intersect, in part, because these groups sadly share a history of attack.
We all recall the outrageous comments by Jimmy ""The Greek"" Snyder about black athletes. Snyder said blacks were bred for strength during slavery, and thus were superior athletes today.
Few of us recall similar comments made, fifty years ago, about Jews. ""Jewish players seem to take naturally to the game of basketball,"" Ed Sullivan wrote in 1933.
""Perhaps,"" he said, ""that is because the Jew is a natural gambler and will take chances.""
Few noticed — and fewer denounced — a statement from another sports figure, Hall of Fame baseball player Steve Carlton. Carlton said, ""the Elders of Zion, 12 Jewish bankers meeting in Switzerland, a committee of 300 meeting in Rome, the National Education Association, Yale's Skull and Bones Society and the World Health Organization"" are ""plotting against us.""4
Racial and ethnic turmoil and conflict seem to be constants, in every corner of the nation.
All of this sends a clear signal that race and ethnicity are too much with us, that we remain a nation divided.
Let me begin with some history, and conclude, if you will, with an agenda we both ought to share.
The first blacks came to the American colonies in 1609; the first Jews 45 years later.
Those first blacks were indentured servants and slaves; the first Jews were merchants and professionals.
The difference between blacks, arriving in chains before the Mayflower sailed from England, and Jews, who arrived in relative comfort, remains a measurable difference between blacks and Jews today; no matter how many steps upward each has taken in the three centuries since both arrived, Jews, having started upward first, still stand today on a higher rung.
Even the impoverished Jewish immigrants arriving here at the end of the nineteenth century, refugees from Czarist terror and economic hardship, were still better off than those blacks who had already called America home for more that 200 years.
Jews had never been slaves in America. Nor had the entire weight of public policy conspired to keep them politically and economically impotent for nearly all the period of their history in this land. For more than two-thirds of our history in America, blacks were denied the chance to form families, to learn to read, add, or write. Slavery gave way to state sponsored racial subjugation; lynch law and Jim Crow ensured a permanent position at the bottom for blacks.

Until the middle of the nineteenth century, Jews were passive observers, not aggressive participants, in American society.
""The Jews who first came to America in the seventeenth, eighteenth, and early nineteenth centuries were heirs to a conservative political tradition that tended to embrace the status quo and sought not to rock the boat.""5 ""Unlike the Quakers,"" Jonathan Kaufman writes, ""or even the blue-blooded Protestant Brahmins of Boston, American Jews did not have a history of becoming involved in liberal causes, even during the Civil War.""6
""It was a paradox,"" Kaufman says, ""that America's Jews — who would come to be seen in the twentieth century as defenders of the poor and the weak, eager to vote for social programs and back civil rights protests — largely sat out the epic battles of reform and emancipation that coursed through America in the nineteenth century.""7
Before the Civil War, Jews were on both sides of the growing and passionate debate over slavery. If some Jews, like Rabbi David Einhorn of Baltimore, joined with the opponents of slavery, others, like the Confederacy's Secretary of State, Judah P. Benjamin, endorsed and defended it.
But when General Ulysses S. Grant issued an order in 1862 expelling Jews from doing business in the portion of the South occupied by federal troops. This blatant anti-Semitism from the man who would be President, the growing instances of social and economic segregation visited upon Jews, and then the lynching of Leo Frank in Atlanta in 1913 quickened a growing consciousness that the United States might not be as secure a haven from Europe's terrors as many Jews had hoped.
A new wave of Jewish immigrants, two million strong, poor and working class, from Russia and Eastern Europe, steeped in socialism and trade union activism, had poured into the United States after 1880, overwhelming the 250,000 largely German Jewish population already here.
These new arrivals ""hurled themselves into politics, union organizing, and public life.""8
As immigration changed the population and politics of American Jews, population shifts produced changes in black America as well.
Before the dawn of the twentieth century, 90% of all blacks lived in the American South. Between 1910 and 1920, the first large wave of modern migration by Southern blacks had begun. Those ten years saw Detroit's black population increase 600%, Cleveland's blacks grow 300%, Chicago's by 150% and the black population of New York, Philadelphia, and Cincinnati double.

The Jewish press began to bring Jews a picture of the suffering of blacks. The shared experience of descendants of Egyptian and American slaves, of the victims of Cossacks and the victims of the Ku Klux Klan, were real and exact.
Pogroms in Russia and lynch mob action in America were the same — ""the same soil, the same people,"" the Yiddish Forward wrote in 1917.
Populist anti-Semitism and the terrifying rhetoric of growing American nativism made black-Jewish alliance inevitable and necessary, and Jewish support for black causes — for democracy's causes — absolute.
Blacks and Jews helped form the NAACP in 1909, and the Urban League a year later.
Grant's infamous General Order #11, the growing wave of anti-Semitism that erupted in Leo Frank's murder, and the institutionalization of anti-Semitism in American life pushed blacks and Jews closer together — fellow sufferers at the hands of a hostile white and gentile majority — in an alliance that would continue for more than half a century.
Despite continuing and deep seated prejudices, by the 1940s American Jews were moving upward in society, and by the 1950s, must have been rated the most successful of ethnic groups in the United States by any measure — economic attainment, academic achievement, and professional status.
It was in this period that black Americans began to make advances, and quickened their demands as well.
In 1954 and 1955, the United States Supreme Court declared segregated schools illegal and ordered that slow steps be taken to destroy unequal education.
The Court's ruling destroyed segregation's legality, and an army of nonviolent protestors quickly arose to challenge its morality as well.
In 1955 the Montgomery bus boycott began and the modern civil rights movement followed. The Civil Rights Acts of 1957 and 1960 made a modest national commitment to equal rights. The next several years saw real progress made, and the coalition of conscience continued on.
Legal segregation in the United States was ended. In 1965 the Voting Rights Act became law, and slowly, but surely, black Americans began to take their proper place in public life.
Blacks and Jews died in a common grave in Mississippi in 1964, and again in Greensboro in 1979.
Sadly today, much of the common history of blacks and Jews rests in popular memory on the lonely shoulders of the civil rights movement's 1964 martyrs, James Cheney, Andrew Goodman and Mickey Schwerner.
Behind them is a largely unknown story with anonymous heroes which predates their sad sacrifice.
Many of the Jewish partners in the earlier struggle for civil rights were junior partners voluntarily; in consequence, their names are little known today.
In the civil rights movement, Martin Luther King often spoke words written for him by his closest white friend, Stanley Levison, a Jew. Clarence Mitchell, a black man, stalked votes in Congress' halls arm in arm with Joseph Rauh, a Jew.
Jack Greenberg joined the Legal Defense Fund of the NAACP in 1949 and became its Director in 1961. Arnold Aaronson was founder — with Roy Wilkins and A. Philip Randolph — of the Leadership Conference on Civil Rights in 1950. Kivie Kaplan was a long-time President of the NAACP, and two Jewish brothers, Arthur and Joel Spingarn, were among its first officers. There are other names — Will Maslow, Hyman Bookbinder, Henry Scwarzschild, Rabbi Abraham Joshua Heschel and Jack Rothschild and so many others all too often forgotten today.
Jewish philanthropy did more than support civil rights; it helped support black education and a host of other causes. Julius Rosenwald's gifts alone had helped build more than 5,000 schools in the South by 1932. Prior to the Depression, as many as 40% of Southern black school children were educated in Rosenwald schools.
Rosenwald spent $22 million between 1917 and 1948 -- when a million was a million. The recipients included Morehouse College, my alma mater, which two of my sons attended; Spelman College where two daughters studied; Fisk University where my mother graduated; Meharry Medical College where I was born; Lincoln University where my father graduated and became the first black President; Fort Valley State College where my father became first President, and Atlanta and Dillard Universities where my father served as Dean.
Rosenwald gave money to help create the Southern Regional Council, where I was once employed and on whose Board I once served; he helped support the NAACP, upon whose board I serve today with Rabbi David Saperstein.
The Rosenwald Fellowships are a Who's Who of black America in the '30s and '40s; they include five of my college teachers; W.E.B. DuBois and James Baldwin and Kenneth Clark and Ralph Ellison and Aaron Douglas and John Hope Franklin and Langston Hughes and Carl Holman and Percy Julian and Claude McCay and Gordon Parks and Margaret Walker and Augusta Savage and Ralph Bunche and Grace Towns Hamilton and Adelaide Cromwell Hill and my uncle, J. Max Bond, and my father, Horace Mann Bond.
While working for the Rosenwald Fund, my father found himself stuck in mud up to his axles on a deserted Alabama farm road. Two black men — who had apparently created the trap — and a mule appeared as if by magic and rescued him. Before he dared to ask them what their fee would be for helping him escape from a mudhole they surely had created, they asked him why he found himself so far from civilization in such a nice suit and car. He told them he worked for the Rosenwald Fund, and asked how expensive his salvation would be.

""You work for Cap'n Julius?"" they exclaimed! There would be no charge for sending one of Julius Rosenwald's employees safely on his way.
If Jewish liberalism was not a given in the nineteenth century, by the twentieth it was a foregone conclusion. From passive bystanders, Jews had become active participants, and by the 1930s, had found a political home.
Blacks shifted allegiance too in the '40s from the Republican to the Democratic Party; today both blacks and Jews remain more loyal to Franklin Roosevelt's party than any other group of voters.
In 1945, newly elected Congressman Adam Clayton Powell made his first speech on the House floor. The topic was anti-semitism. ""...I will always oppose anyone who tries to besmirch any group because of race creed or color,"" he said.9
Blacks and Jews still vote together today, at least in most national elections.
In 1992 and '96, among white voters, only Jewish voters came close to casting as high a percentage of their votes for Bill Clinton as did blacks.
It would be wrong to suppose that ruptures in the relationship began only when the Rev. Jesse Jackson used offensive language, or when Minister Louis Farrakhan said Judaism was a gutter religion.
As they began to occupy the same cities, blacks and Jews began to edge apart. In Northern cities, blacks and Jews weren't always soldiers marching for civil rights; they were sometimes ""landlord and tenant, housewife and servant, employer and employee, merchant and customer, professional and client.""10
Blacks in the ghetto, Bayard Rustin wrote, ""see four kinds of white people: the policeman, the businessman, the teacher and the welfare worker. . . . Three of these four are Jewish.""11
If three-quarters of the representatives to the poor from the power which controls their community from afar share a religion, it is an easy if incorrect step toward believing that they and all their co-religionists are a common enemy.

Writing in 1948 James Baldwin said blacks and Jews ""do not dare to trust each other — the Jew because he feels he must climb higher on the American social order and has, so far as he is concerned, nothing to gain from identification with any minority even more unloved than he; while the Negro is in the even less tenable position of not really daring to trust anyone.12
These divisions gained credence in 1963 when Commentary editor Norman Podhoretz wrote in ""My Negro Problem — and Ours"" that his childhood hatred, fear and envy of blacks continued into his mature thinking years.
Jews, he wrote, were ""tied to a memory of past glory and a dream of imminent redemption. What does the American Negro have,"" he asked, ""that might correspond to this? His past is a stigma, his color is a stigma, and his vision of the future is the hope of erasing the stigma by making the color irrelevant, by making it disappear as a fact of consciousness.""13
Two years later in 1965, Rabbi Arthur Hertzberg declared that Jews were no longer ""have-nots"" but had joined the ""haves"" and consequently needed to reassess their relationship with American society, and with the then-active civil rights movement. Within the next decade, the reassessment was complete.
The focus of the civil rights movement had shifted north, toward communities where conflict between blacks and Jews was deep seated, rooted in tension between landlord and tenant, merchant and customer.
A Jew in Harlem, James Baldwin wrote, ""is singled out by Negroes not because he acts different from other white men, but because he doesn't.""14
And in 1957, the struggle in tribal New York City over school decentralization, pitting black parents and students against largely Jewish teachers and administrators transcended the political struggle it was; instead, it became a national object lesson in anti-Semitism for Jews and in Jewish intransigence for blacks. For blacks, Jews in New York's school system were seen as unwilling to share power with blacks; for Jews, blacks wanted Jews removed from power only because they were Jews.
This conflict could only erupt in New York, and only in New York-centric America would New York's narrow example become a national lesson.
Then with DeFunis v. Odegaard in 1974 and Bakke v. Regents in 1977, the lines of black forward progress were sharply drawn.
Major Jewish organizations — the Anti-Defamation League, the American Jewish Committee and the American Jewish Congress — took an active role in opposing programs designed to include qualified minorities; to succeed, they claimed, these programs must exclude some qualified members of the majority.
Black organizations took the opposite view; these programs placed no arbitrary ceilings on the already limitless aspirations of whites; instead, they placed a firm foundation beneath the aspirations of blacks, denying race as a future rationale for permanent placement at life's bottom, insuring competition that is fair in fact as well as in promise.
The language of the briefs supporting Alan Bakke and others like him would later find its way into the legal arguments of the Reagan and Bush Justice Departments, an oxymoron if ever one existed.
The resignation of Andrew Young from his United Nations post in 1979 hastened the split; only two officials of Jewish organizations had asked Jimmy Carter to fire Young, but many blacks felt as if the entire weight of Jewish America had landed on a popular black hero.
But blacks and Jews, then and now, expressed similar longings -- to become a part of American society. Blacks wanted what Jews wanted, but these two groups saw themselves in different lights.
For Jews, the promise of this new land was to be treated equally while remaining different, to enjoy the pluralism of the New World. For blacks, assimilation was a requirement to achieving integration.
[The right margin increases for the next paragraph. See images.]
As James Farmer put it, ""(America) would become color blind when we gave up our color. The white man . . . would presumably only give up his prejudices. We would have to give up our identification.""15
Rejecting this process — as American Jews quite properly reject abandoning their Jewishness — began to tear further at the web connecting blacks and Jews.
The paradox of the relationship was revealed. Blacks and Jews, in the North, at least, were strangers and neighbors, living in proximity without equality. There were allies on the civil rights battlefield who parted company over the direction the war might take and the choice of weapons which might be used. Blacks wanted strong measures that would do the job, that would right the wrong. Some Jews resisted using tools which had once been used to vanquish them.
The new black pride awakened in the early '60s seemed offensive to many liberals, including many Jews.
It was ironic, Peter Rose has written, that blacks now wanted ""what Jews already possessed, a chauvinistic sense of their own collective worth, a pride in the uniqueness of their past.""16
For blacks, as Podhoretz had told us, there was no pride of past — only stigma.
It must be our imperfect collective memories which suggest the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and the Voting Rights Act of 1965 were the last great public national results of the strained alliance between blacks and Jews.
The coalition has quietly continued its record of success into the 1980s and 1990s, throughout the Reagan, Bush, and Clinton years. It helped to defeat the nomination of Robert Bork to the Supreme Court and to pass the 1988 Fair Housing Amendments, the Civil Rights Restoration Act, the Martin Luther King Holiday Bill, and the Japanese-American Redress Act and the 1990 and 1991 Civil Rights Acts.
Together, blacks and Jews successfully urged Congress to fund the Legal Services Corporation and to repudiate the discredited Civil Rights Commission. Together, they tried to defeat Clarence Thomas' nomination to the Supreme Court.
Major Jewish organizations do support race conscious remedies for discrimination, including goals and time-tables; a few support quotas when a court has made a finding of pervasive discrimination.
If our more recent common history seems depressing, and if it seems as though past achievements won in common struggle are insufficient to bind black and Jew together now, reflect where we each might have been had we faced our common enemies alone.
The more than half a century of solid, productive cooperation between us produced real progress. It did then, and it can now. It put civil rights -- for black and brown and other Americans -- on the national agenda. It created a progressive infrastructure in American that, however weakened, stands today.
And it built this creative, caring coalition on a heritage of shared religious belief and ancient and present suffering, on shared values, on common ground.
Through all its differences, the political coalition remains intact.
But the alliance is strained, over differences both real and perceived.17
We ought never forget that there are Jews who do not like blacks and blacks who do not like Jews. Ignoring this reality, and refusing to fight against it, allows its eventual development into terrifying final solutions.
The victims of racial and religious bigotry, on power's edge, should try in ordinary self interest to hold their disagreements to a minimum.
But disagree they will. But there is much upon which they should agree.
In a historic speech at Howard University almost three decades ago, Lyndon Johnson said: ""To be black in white society is not to stand on level ground. Until we overcome unequal history, we cannot overcome unequal opportunity.""
[The right margin increases for the next two paragraphs. See images.]
""Negroes,"" he continued, ""have been another nation, deprived of freedom, crippled by hatred, the doors of opportunity closed to hope.""
""The task,"" he said then, ""is to give twenty million American Negroes the same chance as every American to learn and grow — to work and share in society — to develop their abilities, physical, mental and spiritual, and to pursue their individual happiness. To this end equal opportunity is essential, but equal opportunity is not enough.""18
Johnson, as you know, was an unlikely source for such a sentiment. To reach it, he had to overcome his heritage and environment. He was a Texan and a Christian, born of that generation of white Americans who demanded, enforced and accepted their superiority as the natural order, God-ordained.
For we Americans, are the three-and-a-half decades since 1964 sufficient time to end the effort aimed at eradicating three centuries of white skin privilege? May honest efforts, adopted when moral suasion and the forces of the law had failed, be permitted to prove their worth, or must the few forward steps black Americans have taken be reversed because the victimizers now claim they are victims, and the old victims have received too much?
I think not, and I cannot help but believe that other victims of discrimination on these shores will agree.
We agree that bigotry in a presidential or gubernatorial campaign, or anywhere else in public or private life — is real cause for fear and concern. Its practioners must be rebuffed and rejected, as must those anywhere who preach the doctrines of division and hate.
Strains between blacks and Jews at the fringes of our society or at the center cannot become reasons why yesterday's cooperation cannot continue on.
There was a special magic — not in blacks and Jews alone — that made the alliance grow and prosper for more than fifty years. That magic was found elsewhere, in America, in the promise that all could be free, that all were equal. Blacks and Jews and other Americans believed the magic then, and because they believed it, they worked to make it so.
It may be that only some of us — some blacks and some Jews — believe it now. But if we believe alone, our charge is to make others believe again.
As we do, let us remind ourselves that we cannot build a common future on common graves alone. Yesterday's sacrifices by Cheney, Goodman, and Schwerner are not sufficient foundation to carry us through the challenges of today. They are the hard rocks upon which we must build, but in our common struggle for political and social justice, credentials must be renewed every day.
Despite the rise in the publicized incidents of racism and anti-semitism, the devils we face don't always loudly shout Hitler's praise or wear white robes. They sometimes speak softly that America faces decline because too many of the wrong people have gotten in. They write books that argue liberalism died because too many blacks or women made unreasonable demands for fair play. They explain away racism at the ballot box as the proper response of alienated Americans threatened by intrusions from outsiders with darker skins, foreign accents or larger families.
Some years ago, the right wing blamed progressives because, they said, we always blamed America first. They were wrong then as they are wrong now — we only wanted America to be what it had promised that it would be.
Today, they blame minorities first. Blacks, women and Hispanics, they say, have destroyed the meritocracy that was America, a land where jobs went only to the skilled, a land full of successful suburbs, where every child waved an American flag, where every day was the Fourth of July.
There is no lack of critical examination by blacks of any of the currents, good and evil, that flow through black America today.
What's missing is critical examination of the ugly virus of racism and ethnic hatred that are running rampant in majority America, by members of the majority.
In years past, whenever some black figure, however marginal, uttered anti-semitic sentiments, I was sure to get a call which demanded I quickly denounce the speaker and the words that had been spoken. Denunciation of figures like Louis Farrakhan, for some, has become a litmus test imposed on black American leaders, through which blacks legitimize their right to participate in mainstream politics. Many understandably perceive this test as a humiliating power play.
Today, I want someone to denounce the powerful figures of evil who threaten my existence daily, and I want an end to defining anti-semitism as if only black people practiced it; as if race problems are only black problems, all along.
The black scholar Julius Lester, a Jew, argues that black anti-semitism, however serious, is different here from the European variety. In Europe Jews were a distinct minority; here they are part of the white majority, and were able to become white in America only because there are people here who are called black and who are treated differently — worse — because they are.
In a speech before the Anti-Defamation League, Lester said: ""Regardless of the extent to which an individual may regard her or himself a Jew, when he and she walk down the street, they blend in with the majority. White skinned Jews look white in a crowd.""
""Because Jews partake of and share in the majority identity as whites, Jews have benefitted economically. In Europe, Jews were victims; in America, Jews are a success story.""
""Blacks are aware"", Lester said, ""in ways many Jews are not, that within the American context, blacks and Jews do not share common experiences of oppression and suffering.""
Listing examples of differences in social and economic status between blacks and Jews, Lester asked an important question:
""In focusing attention on black-Jewish relations, have we been reacting to a symptom?""
""I wonder,"" he asks, ""if it is in our self interest as Jews any longer to speak of black-Jewish tensions. Yes, they exist, but are they the problem?""19
His solution is to begin an attack on racism among whites.
I believe he is right.
In today's climate, the ravings of black anti-semites are likely to increase. They serve, for these bigots, several purposes.
First is an attack, not on Jews, but on mainstream civil rights leaders who are accused of being appendages of Jewish interests, unable to act independently, uninterested in solving the problems that afflict black America.
Destabilizing mainstream leadership is an old goal among a sector of black nationalist thought, and tying that leadership to Jews — or to other interests outside black communities — is part of that tradition. Tying their failures to Jews helps to weaken them and increases the strength of their critics.
A second purpose is much older. Scapegoating others as responsible for problems that seem insoluble is an ancient dodge; it serves to solidify the oppressed community against a powerful, outside ""other."" There are powerful historical precedents for this tactic, both in the history of European anti-semitism and in the development of racist thought over centuries.
There is some consolation in discovering the origins of your problems in an already suspect class. Sadly, for some, there is great appeal in attacking a vulnerable people, especially if you are even more vulnerable yourself.
There is also comfort found in comparing and contrasting victimhood — whose tragedy was the greatest, the European holocaust during the second World War or the holocaust of slavery, segregation, and the racism of today. Which movie was best — Schindler's List or The Amistad?
Here the truth is that these events are beyond comparison — there is no way to place the suffering of the Jews on one side of a scale and the suffering of blacks on the other and to judge which group suffered more. Even if there were, what would the side that wins gain? Is there a prize for the most people killed? If there is, what is it? Can Burindi and Rwanda compete? Are there regional contests?
There is also power found in attacking people who respond angrily to your provocations. When blacks mouth anti-semitic slogans, they command more attention than anti-semitic whites, and attention is what many of these figures badly want. The irony of members of a despised class attacking members of another is news today and will be news tomorrow.
Finally, one ought not forget the powerful influence of religion — not Islam — but Christianity — in creating the image of the greedy Jew, the Christ-killer. That image competes in black America with the historic self-identification among blacks and Jews as former slaves. It should be no surprise when black Americans adopt the evil attitudes of the people who taught them Christianity years ago. I mentioned the religious right when I began — they represent more than a conservative force in our society. They are central to the contention that things 'Christian' are American and right; things non-Christian — including Jews — are less American and wrong.
Thirty-five yYears ago, my father spoke to a gathering like this one, a 1965 New York Conference on Negro-Jewish relations in the United States. [A handwritten X appears in the right margin, likely pointing out the revision in the previous sentence.] To prepare, he read the then-current literature on anti-Semitism, he interviewed the Atlanta minister of the Nation of Islam, and he embarrassingly recalled his youthful clash, 48 years earlier, with a Jewish boy who had called him a 'nigger.' In his anger, he called the boy 'Christ-killer.'
In his closing remarks, he talked about the gratitude Southern blacks of his generation felt toward Julius Rosenwald's generosity.
""...I felt,"" he said, ""the edge of their gratitude was sharpened by the sense of Rosenwald's generosity coming as an appropriate gesture of help from an elder brother in the family of oppression. Their old familiar friend, the people of Israel who had once suffered in Egypt land, as they were now doing, had not forgotten them or forgotten the history of their own people.""20
Anti-semitism, like racism, may always be with us. It ought to be our responsibility to recognize them when we see them, to oppose them, and to dedicate ourselves to their end.
When the idea of racial justice seemed a widely accepted idea three decades ago, we never imagined achieving it would be painless and cost free. It hasn't been, of course; change never is. And when it began to cost and pinch, its popularity began to fade.
In the long run, however, the cost of achieving justice is never so great as the cost of justice denied; that cost is measured in social disruption and human decay.
The coalition between blacks and Jews helped make the American promise real. Strengthened and renewed, that coalition can finish what it helped begin, and in the process, revive the spirit that bought black and white, Jew and Gentile together in common cause.
We can, and shall, overcome.

These are sad days for all of us, for Americans living in a land dedicated to freedom and justice.
An attack of unimaginable viciousness and cruelty has been visited upon us.
Not only has the loss of life been great, but also the loss of security which we cherished.
We felt safe and invulnerable here in America, safe and secure from all alarm.
These murderers have stolen life; we cannot let them steal or weaken our values.
We will prevail — because we believe in freedom, and the guilty will be punished — because we believe in justice.
America's twin towers — freedom and justice — are still standing. It is the NAACP's job to protect them, and we intend to continue to do that job in time of crisis.
We have always seen our work as America's work; now it is our patriotic duty.
The NAACP was created to fight for freedom and justice in a nation dedicated to those goals. We will continue this fight now with renewed determination. Each of us has a role to play as guardians of our nation's liberty, and that is our role.
2
Long before the world changed on September 11, there were those who rejected any mention of race in the political discourse as ""divisive"" or ""playing the race card"", as if complaints of discrimination were only slick tricks in a sidewalk game of three-card monte. We can expect such claims to become even more common now, and we must be prepared to counter them.
Our democracy was built on dissent; we cannot sacrifice the right to protest, especially now, when it is most at risk. We know our Constitution is strong enough to protect Americans' security and America's freedom.
More than 6,000 people died in this unspeakable tragedy. Most were Americans, but they died with people from more than 50 other countries. Two hundred from Great Britain are missing and presumed dead; 250 from Chile; 200 from Columbia; 130 from Turkey; 115 from the Philippines; 110 from Israel; more than 100 from Germany; more than 20 each from Austria, Argentina, Bangladesh, Belgium, Brazil, Cambodia, Canada, China, the Czech Republic, Ecuador, El Salvador, Egypt, France, Ghana, Guatemala, Hong Kong, Italy, Ireland, Japan, Jordan, Kenya, Lebanon, Luxembourg, Malaysia, Mexico, the Netherlands, Pakistan, Paraguay, Peru, Portugal, Russia, South Africa, Spain, South Korea, Sweden, Switzerland, Thailand, Taiwan, Ukraine, Uruguay, Venezuela and Zimbabwe are missing.
That's why they called it the World Trade Center.
Among the Americans were blacks, whites, Latinos, Asians, Christians, Muslims, and Jews — as diverse in death as we are in life.
One of those who escaped from the World Trade Center said, ""If you had seen what it was like in that stairway, you'd be proud. There was no gender, no race, no religion. It was everyone, unequivocally, helping each other.""i
3
But away from that stairway, in America's streets, there is gender, there is race, there is religion. Since the attacks, people who look like Arabs or Muslims have been harassed, assaulted, even killed.
On the Saturday following terrible Tuesday, in Mesa, Arizona, a gunman shot to death the Sikh owner of a gas station and fired on a Lebanese clerk at work and an Afghan family at home. When he was arrested, the suspect said, ""I'm a patriot. I'm a damn American all the way.""ii
What he is really is a damn fool.
As Jordan's King Abdullah wisely observed, ""The terrorists are trying to break down the fabric of the U.S. They want to break down what America stands for . . . . [I]f the American communities start going after each other, if we see America fragment, then you destroy that special thing that America stands for. That's what the terrorists want ... .""iii
Less than a week after the attacks, President George W. Bush went to the Washington Islamic Center. Standing in his stocking feet, the President vowed to prevent hate crimes and discrimination against Arabs and Muslims in the wake of the attacks. The Administration's two goals — retaliation against terrorists abroad and promotion of tolerance at home — are reminiscent of the Double V campaign during World War II: victory against fascism abroad and racism at home.
With the events of September 11, we realize we have not achieved either victory yet — not yet against tyranny abroad — not yet against racism here at home.
Just as this enemy is more difficult to identify and punish, so is discrimination a more elusive target today.
4
No more do signs read ""white"" and ""colored."" The law now requires the voters' booth and schoolhouse door to swing open for everyone. No longer are they closed to those whose skins are black.
But despite impressive increases in the number of black people holding public office and wearing white collars, despite our ability to sit and eat and ride and vote and go to school in places that used to bar black faces, in some important ways nonwhite Americans face problems more difficult to attack today than in the years that went before.
For those African-Americans for whom the nineties were more economic bust than boom, the economic ramifications of our national tragedy will be particularly painful. As the economy continues to slide and layoffs mount, the last hired become the first fired, joining unemployment rolls already populated by twice the percentage of blacks than whites.
And our community, disproportionately represented in the nation's armed forces, may be disproportionately devastated in the event of a protracted military conflict.
In the summer of 1918, on the eve of America's entry into World War I, one of the NAACP's founders, W. E. B. Du Bois, urged blacks to ""forget our special grievances and close ranks shoulder to shoulder with our fellow citizens and allied nations that are fighting for democracy.""
He faced a strong barrage of criticism and soon began to regard his statement as a colossal blunder. It soon taught the lesson that democracy is often a first casualty in wars fought to save democracy.
So while we will close ranks, we will not put aside our right to dissent and to petition our government for a redress of our grievances. To do otherwise would be a denial of the democracy we are defending. When we
5
succeed, America succeeds. America is strongest when it is just. She is strongest when her people are free.
Whatever comes in the weeks and months ahead, let us remember the words of the poet Langston Hughes, who wrote that black Americans:
""...want what 'so proudly we hailed at the twilight's last gleaming.' We want 'my country 'tis of thee sweet land of liberty.' We want everything we ever heard about in all the Fourth of July speeches ever spoken.""iv

Freedom and justice draw us here today. Let us talk about them now.
We have recently witnessed what almost no other living Americans have ever seen: the death of an old century and the birth of a new one.
The passage of a century — one hundred years — is a grand old age for a woman or a man; it is only a fraction in the lifetime of a nation.
We are such a young nation so recently removed from slavery that only my father's generation stands between Julian Bond and human bondage.
Like many others in this nation, I am the grandson of a slave.
My grandfather was born in 1863, in Kentucky; freedom didn't come for him until after the 13th Amendment was ratified in 1965.
He and his mother were property, like a horse or a chair. As a young girl, she had been given away as a wedding present to a new bride, and when that bride became pregnant, her husband — that's my great-grandmother's owner and master — exercised his right to take his wife's slave as his mistress. That union produced two children — one of them my grandfather.
As a teenager, barely able to read and write, he hitched his tuition — a steer — to a rope and walked 100 miles across Kentucky to Berea College,
6
and Berea took him in. 16 years later, he graduated, and the college asked him to deliver the commencement address. He said then:
""The pessimist from his corner looks out on the world of wickedness and sin and blinded by all that is good or hopeful in the condition and progress of the human race, bewails the present state of affairs and predicts woeful things for the future.
In every cloud he beholds a destructive storm, in every flash of lightening an omen of evil, and in every shadow that falls across his path a lurking foe.
He forgets that the clouds also bring life and hope, that lightning purifies the atmosphere, that shadow and darkness prepare for sunshine and growth, and the hardships and adversity nerve the race, as the individual, for greater efforts and grander victories.""v

""Greater efforts and grander victories."" That was the promise the generation born in slavery made more than 100 years ago. That was the promise made by the generation that won the great world war for democracy more than five decades ago. That was the promise made by those who brought democracy to America's darkest corners three-and-a-half decades ago. That is the promise we must all seek to honor today.
The Civil War that freed my grandfather was fought over whether blacks and whites shared a common humanity. Less than ten years after it ended, the nation chose sides with the losers and agreed to continue black repression for almost 100 years.
Then, 75 years after the Civil War, we fought the great world war against fascism with a segregated army. Another family member, my father-in-law, fought that war and landed on Normandy Beach two days after D-Day.
7
His name had been the first one called in the draft in Minnesota — newspaper headlines in the Twin Cities announced that Ernest Horowitz's number had come up. Six days after he landed in France, he was talking to a comrade in a foxhole near a small French town called Ste. Mere Eglise. He looked away for a second, and in that moment a German shell exploded. His friend was killed, and for Ernie Horowitz, his leg blown apart by the blast, the war was over.
But he had been one of those who saved the world for democracy.
Another was Corporal Rupert Trimmingham; listen to his experiences traveling from an Army camp in Arizona to a camp in Louisiana in 1944:
""We had to lay over until the next day for our train. We could not purchase a cup of coffee in any of the lunchrooms around there. The only place we could be served was at the railroad station, but, of course, we had to go into the kitchen. As you know, Old Man Jim Crow rules. But that's not all; 11:30a.m. , about two dozen German prisoners of war, with two American guards, came to the station. They sat at the tables, had their meals served, talked, smoked, in fact had quite a swell time. I stood on the outside looking on, and could not help but ask myself these questions: are we not American soldiers, sworn to fight for and die if need be for this our country? Then why are they treated better than we? Why does the government allow such things to go on?""

The black Americans who fought that war returned home determined to make democracy safe for America, to fight as fiercely for freedom here as they had overseas. They joined the movement for civil rights.
During the movement — in Mississippi in the summer of 1964 — three other American men made the ultimate sacrifice — Mickey Schwerner, James Cheney, and Andrew Goodman.
8
Mickey Schwerner was a full-time civil rights worker. Cheney and Goodman were volunteers. Andy Goodman gave up a summer in New York to come to Mississippi in June 1964 — exactly 20 years after Ernie Horowitz landed on Normandy Beach.
James Cheney was born in Mississippi and had already given a year of his young life to what we called the Freedom Movement.
The next year, 1965, the March from Selma to Montgomery took place, producing its martyrs, too; James Reeb, clubbed to death in Selma's streets; Viola Liuzzo, a Detroit homemaker slain on the highway by the Ku Klux Klan; Jimmie Lee Jackson, killed by an Alabama State Trooper.
In the end, all sacrificed for freedom.
What a diverse group; a young man from Minnesota wounded in France in 1944, young men from New York and Mississippi killed in 1964, a white man from New England, a mother from Detroit, a young man from Alabama, five white, two black; three dead in a Mississippi grave, three killed in Alabama, one living still; Jews, Christians, male, female, from North and South — all sharing two traits, bravery and optimism, the best aspects of the American spirit.
They fought against a powerful ideology of racial superiority, at home and abroad. They fought armed with a powerful belief, based on our nation's founding creed, that all are equal and all are entitled to life, liberty and happiness' pursuit.
They shared a common belief that right would and could conquer might. And in France and in Mississippi and in Alabama they succeeded — against great odds.
While you may not think of yourselves as potential heroes and heroines in the mold of those who gave their lives for a cause, like them, you
9
have the power to materially affect the lives and welfare of vast numbers of people in distressed communities -- and thereby to improve the quality of life for us all and to make your world a more just place.
We are all implicated in this struggle, and we all have much to learn — lessons like those being learned by students in the tiny town of Whitwell, Tennessee. Their community of 1600 people is white, Christian, fundamentalist.
Their school has 425 students — 418 whites, 6 blacks, one Hispanic, no Asians, not a single Catholic, no Jews. But tolerance is being taught in Whitwell. The students started the Paper Clip Project, collecting six million paper clips, one for each victim of the Holocaust.
What have they learned from this simple exercise?
One student put it best: ""Now, when I see someone, I think before I speak, I think before I act, and I think before I judge.""vi
Their story reminds me of a group of black high school students who visited the Holocaust Museum in Washington. As they were leaving, one girl, a somber look on her face, turned to a friend and said: ""See, I told you it wasn't just us!""
When the 20th century began, black people were slaves in every way but legally. Most could not vote. Most went to inadequate, segregated schools; most attended for only a few months each year and most seldom went beyond high school. Most worked as farmers or semi-skilled laborers. Few owned the land they farmed or even the homes in which they lived.
The black scholar and activist W. E. B. DuBois described black life then and the world a black man might see:
""He felt his poverty; without a cent, without a home, without land, tools or savings, he had entered into competition
10
with rich, landed, skilled neighbors. To be a poor man is hard, but to be a poor race in a land of dollars is the very bottom of hardships. He felt the weight of his ignorance — not simply of letters but of life, of business, of the humanities; the accumulated sloth and shirking and awkwardness of decades and centuries shackled his hands and his feet. Nor was his burden all poverty and ignorance. The red stain of bastardy, which two centuries of systematic legal defilement of Negro women had stamped upon his race, meant not only the loss of ancient African chastity, but also the hereditary weight of a mass of corruption from white adulters, threatening almost the obliteration of the Negro home.""vii
 

This was the world in which three people met during the first week of 1909 to form what would become the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP).
All were white — one the descendent of abolitionists, another Jewish, the third a Southerner — a Southerner whose mother's people were Kentucky slaveholders, as my father's people were Kentucky slaves.
That meeting resulted in a Call — issued on the 100th anniversary of Abraham Lincoln's birth — which asked as we ask today, how far has the nation come in guaranteeing ""to each and every citizen, irrespective of color, the equality of opportunity and equality before the law?""
Now that slave's grandson is Chairman of the NAACP and teaches at the University of Virginia, founded by slaveowner Thomas Jefferson, teaching young Americans about the modern-day struggle for human liberty. That struggle has its roots in Jefferson's words much more than his deeds, and its parallels in my grandfather's membership in a transcendent generation — that body of women and men born in the 19th century in servitude, freed from slavery by the Civil War, determined to make their way as free women and men.
11
One of my tasks as teacher is to demonstrate the democratic and optimistic nature of the movement. By aiming a microscope at the mass, I help my students discover unknown heroes and heroines. I hope to demonstrate the confidence and sense of possibility which was the movement's engine. By giving voice to the hopefulness of earlier generations who faced resistance and oppression my students have never known, and will never know, I hope to make heroism more available, more attainable to a generation inclined to see through a glass darkly.
Most of those who made the movement were not famous; they were faceless. They were not the noted; they were the nameless — the marchers with tired feet, the protestors beaten back, the unknown women and men who risked job and home and life.
Don't let anybody tell you these men and women lived in the good old days. The truth is that black Americans then faced a borderline genocidal regime. Their lives were cheap and subject to extinction at any white person's whim.
Don't let anyone tell you the movement did not succeed.
It succeeded in spite of what Martin Luther King, Jr. called the brutality of a dying order shrieking across the land. In its successes, it has much to teach us now.
Today, the United States looks back at Vietnam to discover what went wrong. We can look back at yesterday's civil rights movement to discover what went right. Yesterday's movement succeeded because the victims became their own best champions.
When Rosa Parks refused to stand up, and when Martin Luther King stood up to speak, mass participation came to the movement for civil rights.
12
Today, too many of my students and too many others — young and old, black and white — believe they are impotent, unable to influence the society in which they live. Three-and-a-half decades ago, a mass movement marched, picketed, protested, organized and brought state-sanctioned segregation to its knees.
One movement message is that people move forward fastest when they move forward together. Another lesson is that heroes need more than a passive audience if their heroism is to flourish. That audience provides a context for heroism, an encouraging and supportive cast for heroic deeds and a mirror for its valor.
King did not march from Selma to Montgomery by himself. He didn't speak to an empty field at the March on Washington. There were thousands marching with him, and before him, and thousands more who did the necessary work that preceded the triumphant march.
Black Americans really did not march to freedom; they worked their way to civil rights through the difficult business of organizing.
Registering voters, one by one. Organizing a community, block by block. Creating a black-led, interracial movement in which 100 parts made up the successful whole.
The civil rights movement provides a history of aggressive self-help and volunteerism in churches and civic clubs, assisting the needy and financing the cause of social justice, and an equally honorable tradition of struggle and resistance.
But the struggle continues.
Two hundred and forty-six years of American slavery were followed by 100 years of state-sanctioned discrimination, reinforced by public and private brutality, ending only in 1965.
13
Thus it has been only 36 years since all black Americans were promised the full rights of citizens, only 36 years since legal segregation was ended nationwide, only 36 years since the right to register and vote was universally guaranteed, only 36 years since the protections of the law and Constitution were officially extended to all.
And we are now told those short years have been enough.
To believe that is the victory of hope over experience.
To believe that is the victory of self-delusion over common sense.
Those who declare today that yesterday's movement was excessive or went too far ignore our past. They do not understand the present.
As John Hope Franklin writes:
""All whites ... benefited from American slavery. All blacks had no rights they could claim as their own. All whites, including the vast majority who owned no slaves, were not only encouraged but authorized to exercise dominion over all slaves, thereby adding to the system of control.
.… Even poor whites benefited from the legal advantage they enjoyed over all blacks as well as from the psychological advantage of having a group beneath them.
Most living Americans do have a connection with slavery. They have inherited the preferential advantage, if they are white, or the loathsome disadvantage, if they are black, and those positions are virtually as alive today as they were in the 19th Century.""viii

Considering our history, the job done so far has been remarkable, no matter how great the task that remains undone, no matter how long our journey has been.
By the middle of the last century, when mass participation came to the movement for civil rights, everyone — student, homemaker, minister, every woman and every man could become an agent of her or his own deliverance. This was our democracy's finest hour.
14
The removal, over the decades since the 1960s, of the more blatant forms of American apartheid has made it too easy for too many to believe today that all forms of discrimination have disappeared.
Opinion polls reveal that a majority of whites believe that racial discrimination is no longer a major impediment for people of color. In one study, 75 percent of whites said that blacks face no discrimination in obtaining jobs or housing even as housing discrimination becomes more severe.
Polls show that most white Americans believe equal educational opportunity exists right now, even as schools become more, not less, segregated across the country.ix
Despite the death of Jim Crow, race remains the central fact of life for every non-white American, eclipsing income, position, gender, and education. Race trumps them all.
The evidence is everywhere.

A study of workplace discrimination found that blacks and whites with equal qualifications were treated equally barely one-quarter of the time.x
A nationwide study of homebuyers found that minorities face increased discrimination from mortgage lending institutions.xi
A sweeping five-year study concluded that race still determines success in everything from job opportunities to education to housing.xii

And last year — in the year 2000 — 40 percent of Alabama voters, more than half-
15
a-million people, voted to keep the state's statute prohibiting interracial marriage. This year, Mississippians voted by a 2-1 margin to keep the Confederate swastika as their state's flag.
While the nation as whole is more racially and ethnically diverse than at any time in its history, white Americans still choose to live segregated lives. The 2000 Census shows that the average white city- or suburb-dweller lives in a neighborhood that is 80 percent white. Despite years of legal segregation, redlining and other housing-related discrimination, Blacks, Hispanics, and Asians all live in more integrated neighborhoods than whites do.
Most American whites have little contact with minorities. More than one-half of all minorities live in just five states: California, Texas, New York, Florida, and Illinois.
Fifty-five percent of blacks live in the South. Sixty-one percent of Hispanics live in five southwestern states. Among Asians and Pacific Islanders, half live in the West, as do half of Indians, Eskimos, and Aleuts.
[The following three paragraphs are circled over in pen. It appears as though they were marked to not be included in this version of the speech, along with the struck through content on the following page.]
Election 2000 confirmed our deep national divisions. Not only did Al Gore receive 90 percent of the black vote and George W. Bush a majority of white votes, whites made up 95 percent of George Bush's total vote. Although 57 percent of voters with incomes under $15,000 voted for Al Gore, even poor whites cast a majority of their votes for George Bush. Similarly, 54 percent of women voted for Al Gore, but white women slightly favored George Bush.
In politics, as in life, race trumps class and race trumps gender.
The election revealed a cultural, as well as a racial, divide. Gore won every major city and almost all suburbs, while Bush took every small town
16
on a straight line from Redding, California, to Springfield, Illinois — giving new meaning to Woody Guthrie's old song, ""This Land is Your Land, This Land Is My Land.""
The only demographic groups that cast a unified vote were blacks, Latinos, Jews, union members, and residents of large cities — all of whom voted 60 percent or more for Al Gore, and white males, who voted 60 percent for George Bush.
Having voted along racial lines, not surprisingly blacks and whites divided also on the post-election fight, with blacks far more alienated from the process and the results.
[The rest of the page is circled in pen. While unclear, the editors suggest that it was intended to be part of this version of the speech.]
The NAACP's unprecedented voter registration and education drive for Election 2000 was an unparalleled success. Two million more black voters cast ballots in 2000 than in 1996.
The African American share of the total vote increased 25 percent or more in four states. Turnout in Texas increased 50 percent, in Florida 60 percent, and in Missouri, a whopping 124 percent!
In the Sunshine State, which cast a long shadow over Election 2000, more than a million African Americans voted, accounting for more than 15 percent of the total vote, a state record.
But we know that the black share of the vote — in Florida and elsewhere — should have been higher.
The malevolent consequences of arbitrarily diminished vote totals could not have been greater.
The sorry story of voter suppression and nullification in Florida was told by witness after witness at NAACP hearings after the election. They described police stops near polling places, racially motivated voter purges, demands for multiple forms of identification from person who had voted for
17
decades, long-time voters' names missing from the rolls, and other examples of black votes prevented from being counted.
What isn't as well know is that these tactics weren't restricted to Florida and weren't restricted to black precincts. Other minority voters in other places suffered as well.
Our offices were flooded with calls and complaints from across the country — from New York, Virginia, Texas, South Carolina, New Jersey, Michigan, Ohio — state after state where impermissible barriers kept away people who only wanted to be good citizens.
The NAACP has filed a lawsuit in Florida against Secretary of State Katherine Harris and others; it seeks to insure that these outrageous events never, ever happen again. We are committed to guaranteeing that every voter across the country has equal access to the polls and that every vote is honestly and fairly counted.
We heard before the election, ""your vote counts!""
We learned after the election that your vote might not be counted.
This is unacceptable. This is un-American.
We're not going to ""get over it"" until real election reform ""gets over"", until we have guarantees that every vote will count.
Race is a socio-political, not a biological, construct; there are more genetic differences within races than among them. But if race has only socio-political, not biological, significance, it isn't just a pigment of our imagination; it colors all our lives, and it has consequences that can be deadly in the lives of many.
What does it mean to be a member of a racial minority in America?
18
It means a history, and like all history, the past informs and shapes the present.
It is a history of disadvantage, and it is disingenuous to claim that disadvantage has magically disappeared. And it is a history of difference — not simply of skin color and hair texture, but a long history of different treatment that produces different and disturbing outcomes.
If you are a member of the minority, these different outcomes set your group apart from the majority; some of these differences, like skin color, are meaningless, but despite their neutrality, serve for your fellow citizens as badges of unworthiness.
As a member of the minority, you have a higher birth rate, lower life expectancy, higher mortality rate. Your risk of HIV/Aids, of death by homicide and heart disease will be greater.
Your group is younger than majority Americans. Thirty-five percent of all children under 18 are minorities; by 2025 they will approach majority status.
Minorities over 18 and under 64 are already 27 percent of the population; by 2050 they will be a near majority.
The youthful profile of minorities and the comparatively older profile of whites means a graying, aging white manager class is supervising a workforce that grows more multiracial and multicultural every year.
Most Americans celebrate this diversity, and that is good news.xiii But good news is not enough. All of us are implicated in the continuation of inequality, just as all of us would benefit from its end. Discrimination against black Americans alone is estimated to bleed about $240 billion annually from the economy in lost productivity.xiv If black and Hispanic
19
students attended college at the same rate as whites, the national economy would grow by about $230 billion a year.xv
If we face completion of an old mission, we face an old challenge as well — how do we engage the American majority more fully and in a more sustained way in the struggle for fairness and justice?
How do we persuade those unconcerned and uninvolved millions that our work is important work, that it cannot succeed without them, and that its success will benefit them as it benefits us?
It is a serious mistake — both tactical and moral — to believe that this is a fight that must or should be waged by black Americans alone. That has never been so in centuries past; it is even less so in the century unfolding now. It has never been ""just us.""
Wherever there are others who share our condition or concerns, we must make common cause with them. In the NAACP, we believe that colored people come in all colors — anyone who shares our values is more than welcome.
The growth in immigration and the emergence of new and vibrant populations of people of color holds great promise and great peril. The promise is that the coalition for justice can grow larger and stronger, as new allies join the fight. The peril comes from real fears that our common adversaries will find ways to separate and divide us. It doesn't make sense if blacks and Latinos fight over which group has less power; together we can constitute a mighty force for right.
The successful strategies of the modern movement for civil rights were litigation, organization, mobilization, and coalition, all aimed at creating a national political constituency for civil rights.
Today's times require no less, and in fact insist on more.
20
As we find ourselves refighting old battles we thought already won and facing new problems we have barely begun to acknowledge, let us take heart. If there is more to be done, we have more to do it with, much more than those who came before us and who brought us this far.
It is not enough to ignore evil. It is not enough to just do good. It is not enough just to feed the hungry and house the homeless, commendable as these acts are.
It may be helpful to think of our task in this way:
Two men sitting by a river see, to their great shock, a helpless baby floating by. They rescue the child, and to their horror, another baby soon comes floating down the stream. When that child is pulled to safety, another baby comes along. As one man plunges into the river a third time, the other rushes upstream.
""Come back!"" yells the man in the water. ""We must save this baby!""
""You save it,"" the other yells back. ""I'm going to find out who is throwing babies in the river and make them stop!""
Minorities serve society like the canaries that miners used to carry to warn them when the underground air was becoming too toxic to breathe.
But too many people want to put gas masks on the canaries instead of eliminating the poison in the air. Too many want to put life preservers on the babies, or give them swimming lessons, instead of stopping them from being thrown into a treacherous, dangerous stream.
We have a long and honorable tradition of social justice; if yesterday's protests have faded from the headlines, they have not faded from our collective conscience. They still send forth the message that when we act together we can overcome.
21
And we have a revitalized NAACP — 92 years strong — prepared for the challenges that lie ahead.xvi
A civil rights agenda for the beginning of this new century includes continuing to litigate, to organize, to mobilize, forming coalitions of the caring and concerned, joining ranks against the comfortable, the callous and the smug.
We must fight discrimination wherever it raises its ugly head — in the halls of government, in corporate suites or in the streets.
We have work to do. It is not easy work, but we have heroes, hope and history on our side.
We are privileged people living in a small world. If we could shrink the earth's population to a village of 100 people, with existing ratios remaining the same, the world would look like this:

there would be 57 Asians, 21 Europeans, 14 from the Western Hemisphere, both north and south, and eight Africans;
52 of the 100 would be female. Seventy would be nonwhite. Seventy would not be Christians;
six of the 100 people would own 59 percent of all the wealth in the world, and all six would be from the United States;
80 of the 100 would live in substandard housing. Seventy would be unable to read and write. Fifty would suffer from malnutrition;
one would have a college education. One would own a computer.

Looking at the world this way, we are reminded of our privileges and possibilities.xvii
Our world and our lives are changed now. We don't yet know how much. But we have a job to do at home as much as abroad.
22
When I started working four decades ago, there were five workers paying into the national retirement system for every retiree.
I can't possibly know who my five were, but their names could easily have been Carl, Ralph, Bob. Steve, and Bill.
When I retire, there will be only three workers paying into the retirement system. Their names could easily be Tawana, Maria, and Jose.
We need to provide them with the best schools, the best health care, the best jobs, and the strongest protections against discrimination we possibly can.

It was a pleasure to receive this invitation; it is a pleasure to speak to you now.
I am particularly pleased to be here to remember and honor Aaron Henry — a son of Mississippi and a stalwart of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP).
A story is told about Aaron Henry and Ross Barnett, Mississippi's sorry segregationist governor. It seems that one day Doc Henry ran into former Governor Barnett at the airport in Washington. Doc took the Governor, who was by then quite old, to his hotel and escorted him to the registration desk. He explained to the clerk that this guest should be treated with particular deference because he was the former Governor of Mississippi. The unimpressed clerk look at Doc, and said ""And I suppose you are the head of the Mississippi NAACP!""
That, of course, is who Aaron Henry was — or at least a large part of who Aaron Henry was. They say that outside family and people, Aaron Henry had two loves — the Democratic Party and the NAACP, even if those two organizations didn't always love him back.
Since February of last year, I have been Chairman of the Board of the NAACP, the oldest and largest grass roots civil rights organization in the United States, overwhelmingly endorsed by Black Americans as the most effective organization working in their interest.1
Next week, the NAACP will celebrate its 90th anniversary at our convention in New York. We could not be celebrating our successes over these many years were it not for the likes of Aaron Henry.
Aaron Henry joined the NAACP in 1941 when he was 19 years old
2
and a student at Coahoma County Agricultural High School, when a youth membership cost 50 cents. He remained a member until he died, becoming State Conference President forty years ago — in 1959.
Along the way he made choices that were not always popular but were always principled. He showed great courage, commitment and conviction. He also demonstrated great loyalty. We know that people close to him spied on the movement and set Andrew Goodman, Michael Schwarner and James Cheney up for death.
Mississippi produced Aaron Henry, one of the greatest freedom fighters ever, anywhere. It also produced and still produces today some of the most dangerous and dedicated opponents of justice and equality.
We now know, thanks to the opening of the files of the Mississippi State Sovereignty Commission, that the aforementioned Ross Barnett and the Sovereignty Commission funneled what was then hundreds of thousands of dollars — what today would be over a million dollars — to Washington, DC, to try to derail the 1964 Civil Rights Act.2
The money came from the same Yankee aristocrat who founded the Pioneer Fund, which gave us The Bell Curve, the most recent example of racism masquerading as science.
Some of you will remember another notorious Mississippi segregationist — Yazoo City lawyer John C. Satterfield. Within days of President Kennedy's June, 1963 speech calling for what would become the 1964 Civil Rights Law, Satterfield went to Mississippi to marshal opposition. The Director of the Sovereignty Commission wrote, ""It was a thrill to see how the gentlemen at those meetings looked to Mississippi for leadership!""
Fast forward thirty-plus years to today — when some Americans still look to Mississippi for leadership — in the person of the Majority Leader of the United States Senate, Trent Lott. You know Trent Lott — who regularly fraternizes with the leadership of a white supremacist and anti-semitic organization, the Council of Conservative Citizens, which traces its bloodline directly to the White Citizens Council. Lott speaks to their meetings, praises
3
their goals and values, and hosts their leadership in his Senate office in Washington.3
Among his many gifts, Aaron Henry knew people. He loved people, and when he could, he forgave them their weaknesses. He was known for overlooking a person's bad traits in favor of that person's good ones. But, as Sam Simmons tells us, ""The one person who I heard (Aaron) say was 'just no good' was Trent Lott.""
Simmons said Doc Henry ""could talk about all those Republicans and Conservatives, but the only one I heard him describe as just an excuse for a human being was Trent Lott.""
Aaron Henry — what a great judge of people you were!
We know the story Sam Simmons told because Connie Curry has interviewed him and many others for her forthcoming book on Aaron Henry — it will be called The Fire Ever Burning. Her book, together with others by historians John Dittmer and Charles Payne about the Mississippi movement, will help tell Aaron Henry's story.4
Even here in Mississippi, he is not as well known as other freedom fighters.
He may not be as famous, but Aaron Henry was just as formidable — we need to acknowledge his importance, not just to Clarksdale, not just to Mississippi, but to the United States.
John Dittmer writes, ""Aaron Henry was among the last of that generation of black leaders who came out of World War II dedicated to cracking open Mississippi's 'closed society' "".
A few days ago, my mother sent me a Christmas letter my parents had received from a friend in the army in 1944. He wrote:
""... The recent elections posed a problem in the cases of men who couldn't understand how the election laws of their states kept them from voting. As one soldier expressed himself, ""A man feel pretty bad getting ready to go across the water to fight to give the folks something his own wife don't have in Mississippi.""

The letter ends by saying, "" ... many of us have had built into us an understanding and feeling about democracy we never had before. That understanding is essential to the making of a good
4
soldier. The attitudes and outlook demanded of a soldier on the battlefronts far away must be expected in that man in his community when the fighting is finished.""5
Aaron Henry was a good soldier, and for him, Mississippi was as much a battlefield as any foreign soil. Here in Mississippi, he was part of a nonviolent army which not only ended legal segregation but challenged segregation's morality as well.
'Army' is a good way to describe that cadre of women and men because they were at war, and as in every war, they suffered real casualties. But they also won real victories — at lunch counters, movie theaters, bus stations and polling places.
Eventually, with the passage of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and the Voting Rights Act of 1965, the army thought it had finally won the war.
But many, like Aaron Henry, soldiered on, understanding that the fight for freedom is a constant battle.
He was right, of course, as was the great scholar and activist W. E. B. DuBois when he predicted that ""the problem of the 20th Century will be the problem of the color line."" Now short months away from the century's end, one may easily conclude that it will also be the problem of the century yet to come.
We meet here at a time when the leadership of the House and Senate have become the running dogs of the wacky radical right, and are more hostile to civil rights than at any time in recent memory.
The signals are clear.
The new Speaker of the House of Representatives was a co-sponsor of a Resolution in the last Congress which would have eliminated all federal equal opportunity programs in education, employment and contracting.
The last Speaker of the House filed a lawsuit to keep racial minorities from being fairly counted in the next Census.
The Majority Leader of the United States Senate is that son of Mississippi, whom I've mentioned before, Trent Lott, whose segregationist roots are showing.
We meet in the dark shadow of Denny's and Texaco, of Hopwood
5
in Texas, California's Proposition 209 and Washington State's Initiative 200. Everywhere we see clear racial fault lines which divide American society as much now as at anytime in our past.
We meet in sad recollection of the murders of Matthew Shepard in Wyoming and James Byrd in Texas and Billy Jack Gaither in Alabama — innocents butchered because they were different. But their grieving families' response to this brutality gives us reason to be hopeful in the midst of all the horror. Matthew Shepard wanted to work for human rights; even as protestors spewed anti-gay venom at his funeral, his mother said, ""We'll never forget the love the world has shared with this kind, loving son.""
James Byrd's family has started a foundation in his memory to work ""for more dialogue and more tolerance among the races.""
Thus the picture we see is not without its brighter side. Taken over several decades rather than in snapshot moments, our portrait shows clear progress throughout this century. No more do signs read white and colored. The voters' booth and schoolhouse door now swing open for everyone, no longer closed to those whose skins are dark.
But for many, despite these successes, today's civil rights scene must seem like an echo of the past.
The removal of earlier legal barriers which underpinned apartheid in America consumed most of this century and consumed lives and passions too.
Many stand now in reflection of that earlier movement's successes, confused about what the next steps should be. The task ahead is enormous — equal to if not greater than the job already done.
Today we are three decades past the second Reconstruction, the modern movement for civil rights that eliminated legal segregation in the United States, and thirteen decades past the first Reconstruction, the single period in American history in which the national government repeatedly used armed might to enforce the civil rights of black Americans.
One hundred years ago, black Americans faced prospects eerily
6
similar to those we face today. Then it was thirty years after Civil War and the first Reconstruction, the 19th Century was winding down, and white America was growing weary of worrying about the welfare of the newly freed slaves, tired of fighting to secure their rights to vote and to attend a public school.
Then, as now, scientific racism and social Darwinism were in vogue. Then, as now, a race-weary nation decided these problems could be best solved if left to the individual states. Then, as now, minorities and immigrants became scapegoats for real and imagined distress.
Speaking in 1901, my slave-born grandfather viewed the world before him hopefully. He said then:
""The false partitions set up to separate classes and races are falling down. Illogical and un-Christian distinctions, though still disgracing the age and hampering the spirit of progress must soon yield to justice and right .… Then forward in the struggle for advancement.""
""Wrong for a time may seem to prevail and the good already accomplished seem to be overthrown. But forward in the struggle, inspired by the achievements of the past, sustained by a faith that knows no faltering, forward in the struggle.""6
As we recall the struggles of the recent past, many of us are confused about what the movement's aims and goals were, what it accomplished and where it failed, and what our responsibilities are to complete its unfinished business today.
Looking back at that movement from today, we now see a very different view of the events and personalities of the period.
Instead of the towering figures of Kings and Kennedys standing alone, we now also see an army of ordinary women and men, like Aaron Henry.
Instead of famous orations made to multitudes, we now also see the planning and work that preceded the triumphant speech, like the work done by Aaron Henry.
Instead of a series of well-publicized marches and protests, we now also see long organizing campaigns and brave and lonely
7
soldiers often working in near solitude, like Aaron Henry.
Instead of prayerful petitions for government's deliverance, we now see aggressive demands and the ethic of self-help.
We now realize our view of the movement's goals was narrow too. That movement did not want to be integrated into a burning house; rather, it wanted to build a better house for everyone. It marched on Washington for freedom and jobs, not for abstract freedom alone.
And instead of a sudden upsurge in black activism in Montgomery in 1955, we now see a long and unceasing history of aggressive challenges to white supremacy that began as long ago as slavery time.
And instead of a movement that ended in 1968 with the death of Martin Luther King, we now see continued movement stretching from the ancient past until this moment, with different forms and personalities, in many places and locales, with differing methods and techniques, whose central goal has always been the elimination of strictures based on race.
We see a movement which has long followed a plan articulated when the 20th Century was new, a plan that still fits our circumstances today.
In 1905, DuBois proposed:
""We must complain, yes plain, blunt complaint, ceaseless agitation, unfailing exposure of dishonesty and wrong---this is the unerring way to liberty, and we must follow it . . .""
""Next, we propose to work. These are the things that we as Black men must try to do. To press the matter of stopping the curtailment of our political rights; to urge Negroes to vote honestly and effectively; to push the matter of civil rights; to organize business cooperation; to build schoolhouses and increase the interest in education; to bring Negroes and labor unions into mutual understanding; to study Negro history; to attack crime among us . . . to do all in our power, by word and by deed, to increase the efficiency of our race, the enjoyment of its manhood rights, and the performance of its just duties.""7
8
DuBois' plan, written for the all-black Niagara Movement, was incorporated into the new interracial NAACP, born in 1909. Black Americans have generally followed this prescription for action, pursuing civil rights, economic justice, entrance into the mainstream of American life.
The NAACP's founding gave the movement an organized base. It soon developed an aggressive strategy of litigation aimed at striking down racial restrictions enshrined in law, triumphing in 1954 with Brown v. Board of Education, ending segregation in public schools.
From Brown in 1954 forward, the movement expanded its targets, tactics and techniques. Organizations and leadership expanded as well.
The 1955–1956 Montgomery Bus Boycott introduced a new leader, Martin Luther King, Jr., and he articulated a new method — nonviolent resistance — of fighting segregation.
The new method required mass participation. Reliance on slower appeals to courts began to subside.
While the movement expanded, most American Presidents, from the 1954 Brown decision forward, approached race relations gingerly, if at all.
Dwight Eisenhower was a benign racist who lobbied the Supreme Court's Chief Justice against integrating schools, and his vacillation encouraged the resistant white South.8
John F. Kennedy only reluctantly endorsed equal rights before his term and life were cut short.
But in Lyndon Johnson, the movement found a match; a politician who wanted to be remade from Southerner to Westerner to American; a figure conscious that history would be his judge, a human hearted man more sensitive to appeals for racial justice than any President before or after him.
In this period, gains were won in Mississippi and across the South, and the fabric of legal segregation came undone.
That movement then was a second Reconstruction, whose ripples were felt far beyond the Southern states and whose victories
9
benefited more than blacks. Like the first Reconstruction, the second ended when the national purpose wavered and reaction swept the land.
But before the movement slowed, it was our democracy's finest hour. A voteless people voted with their bodies and their feet and paved the way for other social protest.
The movement's origins were in a bitter struggle for elementary civil rights, and it largely became, in the post-segregation era, a movement for political and economic power, and today black women and men hold office and wield power in numbers we only dreamed of before.
But despite impressive increases in the numbers of black people holding public office, despite our ability to sit and eat and ride and vote and attend school in places that used to bar Black faces, in some important ways nonwhite Americans face problems more difficult to attack today than in the years that went before.
Much of the origins of today's distresses are found in the recent past and came to climax in the 1980s.
Over time, opposition to government, especially Washington government, succeeded opposition to Communism as a secular religion. The United Nations, Washington bureaucrats, gays and lesbians and supporters of minority and women's rights replaced the Soviet Union as the Evil Empire, and together, these became the energies driving the callous coalition that captured Congress in 1994.
As long ago as 1964, the Republican Party began to remake itself as the white people's party, and found a winning formula at the intersection of race and opposition to activist government.9
For much of the 1980s. America was presided over by an amiable ideologue whose sole intent was removing government from every aspect of our lives. He brought to power a band of financial and ideological profiteers who descended on the nation's capital like a crazed swarm of right-wing locusts, bent on destroying the rules and laws that protected our people from poisoned air and water and
10
from greed. But nowhere was their assault on the rule of law so great as in their attempt to subvert, ignore, defy and destroy the laws that required an America that is bias free.10
Those years then were what these years now threaten to be — a kind of festive party, thrown for America's rich.
Since 1979, the wages of the bottom 20 percent of workers have dropped nearly 12 percent. Workers at the bottom half of the wage scale make 75 cents less per hour than they did 20 years ago.
This at a time when the average executive earns 220 times what the average production worker is paid.
And for those workers whose skins are black or brown, the gap is greater and their prospects bleaker. Today, the net financial assets of black families in which one member has a post graduate degree are lower than the assets of white families in which the highest level of education achieved is elementary school.
In 1968, the Kerner Commission, appointed by President Johnson to investigate the causes and prescribe the cures for 1967's riots, concluded that ""white racism"" was the single most important cause of continued inequality between blacks and whites.
But within a few short years, the growing numbers of blacks and other minorities and women, pushing for entry into and power in the academy, the media, business, government and other traditionally white male institutions, created a backlash in the discourse over race. The previously privileged majority exploded in angry resentment at having to share space with the formerly excluded.
Opinion leaders began to reformulate and redefine the terms of the discussion. No longer was the Kerner Commission's description of the problem acceptable.
Any indictment of white America could be abandoned, and a Susan Smith defense was adopted — black people did it, did it to the country, did it to themselves. Black behavior — not white racism — became the reason why whites and blacks lived in separate worlds. Racism retreated and pathology advanced. The burden of racial problem solving shifted from racism's creators to its
11
victims. The failure of the lesser breeds to enjoy society's fruits became their fault alone. In a kind of nonsensical tautology we heard again and again: these people are poor because they are pathological, they are pathological because they are poor.
Pressure for additional civil rights laws became special pleading. America's most privileged population, white men, suddenly became a victim class. Aggressive blacks and pushy women became responsible for America's demise.
All this occurred despite almost daily incidents of racial attack, and a series of public opinion polls that demonstrate most white Americans believe racial minorities are less than equal human beings, lacking in thrift, morality, industriousness and patriotism.11
Most Americans don't just believe minorities are suspect; they believe there are more of them than there actually are.
According to a Gallup Poll, the average American thinks that 18% of all Americans are Jewish; the real figure is 3%. The average American thinks that 21% of all Americans are Hispanic; the exact number is 10%; most Americans think that 43% of all Americans are Black; the real figure, of course, is 12%.
For the average American then, minorities are the majority, 71% of the national population.
This exaggeration of the other, this blame-shifting and role-reversal, where victim becomes perpetrator and minorities become majorities, this perversion of reality occurred as a result of an organized campaign which continues until this day.
It is led by a curious mix of whites and a few blacks, academics, journalists and policy-makers.
They profess strong support for equal rights while opposing every tool designed to achieve this goal.
For these new racists, equal opportunity is a burden society cannot afford to bear. Their less than subtle message is that including blacks and women excludes quality.
The continuing disparity between black and white life chances isn't a result of black life choices; it stems from epidemic racism
12
and an economic system dependent on class division.
Abundant scholarship notwithstanding, there is no other possible explanation — not family breakdown, not lack of middle-class values, not lack of education and skills, not absence of role models. These are symptoms. Racism is the cause; its elimination is the cure.
We must be careful not to define the ideology and practice of white supremacy too narrowly. It is greater than scrawled graffiti and individual indignity, the policeman's nightstick, the job or home or education denied. It is rooted deeply in the logic of our market system, in the culturally defined and politically enforced prices paid for different units of labor, and it is deeply entrenched in our national psyche.
The successful strategies of the 1960s movement were litigation, organization, mobilization and coalition, aimed at creating a national political constituency for civil rights advances.
In the 1970s, electoral strategies began to dominate, prompted by the increase in black votes engendered by the 1965 Voting Rights Act.
No sooner had black workers began to win access to industrial jobs and organized labor, the jobs went offshore and labor declined in power and influence.
Some black elites joined white elites at the feeding trough.
Since the heady days of the 1960s, too many have concentrated too much on enriching too few, while the large numbers of working class black Americans, like their counterparts in the larger society, have seen their plight ignored, their incomes shrink and their jobs disappear.
Martin Luther King lost his life supporting a garbage workers' strike in Memphis; the right to decent work at decent pay remains as basic to human freedom as the right to vote.
""Negroes,"" King said in 1961, ""are almost entirely a working people. There are pitifully few Negro millionaires and few Negro employers.""12
13
That there are more black millionaires today is a tribute to the movement King led; that in these best of times unemployment rates for blacks remain twice the rates for whites is an indictment of our economic system and a reflection of our failure to keep the movement coming on.
Everywhere black Americans face conditions different from but just as daunting as the bus back seats, fire hoses and billy clubs of three decades ago.
When I was young, bad boys fought with knives, not with automatic weapons. Crack was something that, if you stepped on it, you'd break your mother's back. Songs we sang were about June and moon, not ugly words for women.
On streets and sidewalks where many black American live, crime and violence are a frequent rule. As angry white men blow up buildings, angry black men blow each other away.
In America today, compared with a white child, a black child is one and a half times more likely to:

grow up in a family whose head did not finish high school.

That child is two times as likely to:

be born to a teenage mother.

That child is two and a half times more likely to:

be born at low birthweight.

That child is three times more likely to:

live in a single parent home.

That child is four times more likely to:

have a mother who had no prenatal care.

That child is four and a half times more likely to live with neither parent.
That child is five times as likely to depend solely on a mother's earnings.
That child is nine times as likely to be a victim of homicide as a teenager or young adult, the end of a long, winding, uphill struggle to beat the racial odds against success.
In life chances, life expectancy, median income — by all the standards by which life is measured, black Americans see a deep
14
gulf between the American dream and the reality of their lives.
For the last 30 years — the period of the second Reconstruction — the most effective tool for advancing entry into the mainstream of American life has been affirmative action.
Opponents now try to tell us that it doesn't work, or it used to work but doesn't now; we used to need it but it isn't needed now; when it does work, it only helps people who don't need it.
Affirmative action really isn't about preferential treatment for blacks; it is about removing preferential treatment whites have received through history, giving equal treatment to people who were denied equality in the past.
Affirmative action isn't a poverty program, and ought not be blamed for failing to solve problems it was not designed to solve. It is a program designed to counter racial discrimination, not poverty. No one beat Rodney King or killed James Byrd because they were poor.
Affirmative action created the sizeable middle class that constitutes one-third of all black Americans today.
In the late 1960s, the wages of black women in the textile industry tripled.13 From 1970 until 1990, the number of black police officers doubled; black lawyers and doctors doubled; black electricians and black college students tripled and black bank tellers more than quadrupled. The percentage in managerial and technical jobs doubled.
These are not just numbers. They represent the growth and spread of the tiny middle class I knew as a boy into a stable one-third of all black Americans today, black women and men with jobs and homes, productive tax-paying citizens, able to provide for their families now and in the future.
Outside this building there is a parking lot. Some of the spaces are reserved for handicapped drivers. An able bodied driver sees those spaces and thinks he has been denied the right to park. But eliminating those spaces increases room for the able bodied by only a handful, but they make all the difference in the world to the handicapped. Removing those spaces deprives us of the company
15
of a man or woman who might enrich our lives.
Without affirmative action, both white and blue collars around black necks would shrink, with a huge, depressive effect on black income, employment, home ownership and education.
This is because racism is alive and all too well in America. Those who would have us believe otherwise, who argue for a return to a fantasy color-blind America that never was, who would have us believe that their opposition to affirmative action is rooted in a desire for fairness and equality — these people are engaged in justification, rationalization and downright prevarication. We have long heard these arguments from white racists — they are joined today by black self-haters and apologists too.
They are color blind, all right — blind to the consequences of being the wrong color in America today.
Let me tell you what they say. It is the fourth quarter of a football game between the white team and the black team. The white team is ahead 145 to 3. The white team owns the ball, the field, the goalposts, the uniforms and the referees. They have been cheating since the game began. There are two minutes left to play. Suddenly the white quarterback, who feels badly about things that happened before he entered the game, says. ""Can't we just play fair?""
In their double-speak 'playing fair' means freezing the status quo in place, permanently fixing inequality as part of the American scene.
They just won't quit. They argue that affirmative action stigmatizes all blacks, making the beneficiaries and all others feel as if they've received some benefit they do not deserve.
Do you ever hear that argument made about the millions of whites who got into college as a 'legacy' because Dad is an alumni? Or the whites who got good jobs because Dad was president of the company? You never see them walking around with heads held low, eyes hidden, moaning that they've lost their self esteem because everyone in the executive washroom is whispering about how they got their job.
16
Today, white males less than 30% of the labor force but are 92% of the United States Senate, 80% of the United States House, 90% of the nation's newspaper editors, and 80% of the tenured faculty at the nation's colleges and universities. I seriously doubt if any of these men is suffering low self esteem or other stigma because he knows race and gender helped them win his job.
Affirmative action's poster child, Justice Clarence Thomas, argues that affirmative action makes black people feel bad. But Thomas may be right. Ever since he got his most recent affirmative action job, he has been in a foul and nasty mood.
As quiet as it is kept, Martin Luther King supported affirmative action. The critics like to quote his dream from 1963 that one day, his children would be judged by the content of their character and not by the color of their skin.
It was a dream then; it remains a dream today.
In 1967 he said: ""a society that has done something special against the Negro for hundreds of years must now do something special for him"".14
Aaron Henry is no longer here to carry on the freedom fight, but what about the rest of us?
There is an enormous opportunity for service and for action available to each of us, wherever and whomever we may happen to be.
There is so much more that needs to be done.
It took but one woman's courage to start a movement in Montgomery, the bravery of four young men in Greensboro to set the South on fire, the committment of Aaron Henry to change Mississippi forever. Surely there are men and women, young and old, here today who can do the same.
The current civil rights scene in the United States may seem dismal but it is not without hope.
The nation's oldest civil rights organization — the NAACP Aaron Henry loved — has revived itself, preparing for the challenges that lie ahead.
At the NAACP, we don't envision much that is new; our enemy,
17
successfully used to fight white supremacy — organization, mobilization, coalition and litigation — remain the basic tools of our movement today.
We intend to do the old things better.
We may use the internet and fax machine now where once a mimeograph machine and the US mail sufficed, but at bottom, our charge is the same — to fight discrimination wherever it raises its ugly head — in the halls of government, in corporate suites or in the streets.
In 1998, we distributed our Congressional report card to our half-million members in 2200 branches in the 50 states, educating them about who supported NAACP positions and who did not. In last fall's elections, black voters made the difference. We intend to make sure they make the difference in the year 2000 as well.
In little more than a year, we have chartered dozens of new Youth and College Branches across the country, eleven of them here in Mississippi.15 Nationally, they range from the campuses of Harvard and Stanford Universities to rural Jasper, Texas and Piney Woods, Mississippi.
We've called on the President to take immediate steps to halt the epidemic of police violence against minorities; from New York to Philadelphia to Pittsburgh to Riverside, California, it is open season on blacks. We insist that it stop and we insist the guilty must be punished.
We've demanded fairer treatment for people with AIDS; this isn't something that happens to someone else, it happens to us, and we insist of equal access to treatment, dug trials and services.
Almost a million and a half black men in America couldn't vote last November, 81,700 of them right here in Mississippi.
That is 13% of all the black men in the United States, 28% of those here in Mississippi.
They had committed a crime. They had done the time. And they were denied the right to exercise the most basic civil ritual — the right to vote.
No other democratic country denies as many the right to vote
18
because of felony convictions.
We intend to do something about it — in the congress and in state legislatures — we intend to re-introduce these men to their civic responsibilities.
There is a place for everyone in the NAACP.
There are no racial, gender or religious barriers to membership in the NAACP; anyone who supports our values is more than welcome. Colored people come in all colors in this country. We move forward fastest when we go forward together; we can't afford to leave a single soul behind.
African-Americans will soon no longer be the nation's largest minority. But by the year 2050, blacks and Hispanics together will make up 40% of the national population. Where there are others who share our condition, even if they do not share our history, we intend to make common cause with them.
When I entered the labor force more than three decades ago, there were only five workers for every retiree.
We can't know who they were, but their names were likely Carl, Ralph, Bob, Steve and Bill.
When I retire, there will be only three workers paying into the system for every retiree — their names may well be Tawana, Maria and Jose.
America needs to insure they have the best futures, the best education, the best health care, the best jobs and schools we possibly can.
You know, I'm old school.
It makes me wanna holler, the way they do my life!
I'm old school.
I remember how we got over.
I'm old school.
I know freedom isn't free.
I'm old school.
Don't let our feet stray from the places, our God, where we met thee.
I'm old school.
19
Lest our hearts, drunk with the wine of the world, we forget thee.
I'm old school.
Come with us to that land for which our fathers sighed.
I'm old school.
Come with us to tomorrow for which our fathers died.
I never met my grandfather. He was born a slave and died before I was born, but if I met him today I think he'd ask, ""What have you done with your freedom?""
My grandfather's words — from the last century — might well be remembered here.
He said in 1892:
""The pessimist from his corner looks out upon the world of wickedness and sin, and blinded by all that is good or hopeful in the condition and progress of the human race, bewails the present state of affairs and predicts woeful things for the future.""
""In every cloud he beholds a destructive storm, in every flash of lightning an omen of evil and in every shadow that falls across his path a lurking foe.""
""But he forgets that the clouds also bring life and hope, that the lightning purifies the atmosphere, that shadow and darkness prepare for sunshine and growth, and that hardships and adversity nerve the race, as the individual, for greater efforts and grander victories.""16
Greater efforts and grander victories. That was his generation's promise more than 100 years ago. That was the promise made by Aaron Henry's generation, who won the great world war for democracy, five decades ago. That was the promise made by those who brought democracy to America's darkest corners three decades ago, and that is the promise we must continue to honor today.

The MINACT, INC. Board of Directors has long believed that young people can achieve any goal on which they set their hearts and imaginations. Our commitment to help make the American Dream a Reality for disadvantaged youth is being accomplished over and over as young people complete vocations, learn new skills and go on to high academic pursuits through Job Corps Centers operated by MINACT, INC. We are meeting the needs of our customers today and pledge to continue to do so in the new millennium. We will continue to achieve at impressive levels and to maintain a high level of performance.
MEET THE BOARD
Dr. Aaron E. Henry [with photograph]
Former Chairman of the Board July 2, 1922 – May 19, 1997
Dr. Aaron E. Henry was among the last of that generation of African American leaders who came out of World War ll dedicated to cracking open Mississippi's ""closed society"", says historian John Dittmer. There isn't one aspect of the fight for freedom and equality in the state of Mississippi in the past 50 years that does not reflect his influence.
Dr. Henry was born in 1922 on Flowers Plantation in Coahoma County, outside Clarksdale, Mississippi. His parents were sharecroppers and he spent his early years picking cotton. After serving in the Army and graduating from Xavier University with a lifelong crusade for change, he chaired the local NAACP. Later as statewide president, Dr. Henry led boycotts, demonstrations and other civil rights activities that resulted in the bombing of his home and his drugstore. Arrested over thirty times, his philosophy was, ""you always get out."" He is remembered for welcoming young civil rights activists in the early 60's and was chosen to chair the Council of Federated Organizations to bring Freedom Summer to Mississippi.
Page 2 of 2
He spoke often about needing ""all the help we can get.""
Beyond Mississippi, his work changed systems and policies of national import. We have Dr. Henry to thank in part for the recognition of racist practices in the media through the suit filed against a local television station and the Federal Communications Commission. He joined the NAACP in high school and later became the longest serving member of its national board of directors. After helping to integrate Democratic Party politics in the State, Dr. Henry remained active at the national level. For housing, health care, employment, childcare, youth and aged programs, he walked through the halls of power in Washington and insisted that Mississippi get its share. He continued his service as a representative in the Mississippi state legislature from 1979–1995.
Dr. Henry evoked deep loyalty from the black people whose lives were made so much better because of his work. He inspired fear, respect and reverence in a white community that he helped change forever. The power structures in Clarksdale, Jackson, and Washington, D.C., paid attention to Dr. Henry because, as a friend said, ""He always followed through ... no empty threats from Aaron Henry."" His friends also characterized him as ""the most forgiving man I've ever known,"" and ""the most courageous person I ever met.""
The accolades are endless and varied. After Dr. Henry's death in 1997, Benjamin Hooks, former NAACP national executive secretary, called him a ""giant"" who devoted his life to the movement. Robert Clark, the first African American to serve in the Mississippi legislature in this century, said quite simply, ""I had more admiration for him than for any other living human being on the face of this earth."" Perhaps Dr. Henry is best summed up in the words of historian Charles Payne as ""a true long distance runner.""

drafts
There is a great deal of discussion in the United States today, especially among the young and the alienated, of several words which have become cliches. Thos most commonly used are ""system"" and ""establishment.""
It is susposed, by those who use these terms, that the ""establishment"" may eother be very large or very small; may include both Nelson Rockefeller and Whitney Young and in the minds of some, even the late Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.; it may include a few millionaires or the entire American middle class; but it is certainly the group that controls things in the United States, and in fact, much of the rest of the world.
The ""system"" is rather more easily but still loosly defined, ] 2 however--it is the process that keeps the establishment in power. Questions are raised about the system, however, and whether it serves the establishment because it is flawed and non-functioning, or whether it is purposely designed, by that very same establishment, to do what it does, and is in fact, working perfectly.
That is the subject for another day, however. For the moment, let us consider this vague organization, the establishment, its relationship to black people white and a great many black young people and the likelyhood or even probability of it becoming either moderately and radically different than it is today.
One may [illegible] assume that if such an animal exists, we as a people are certainly oppressed by it, and if the establishment
2
depends on capitalism and corporate liberalism and moderate welfare ] 3 democracy for its existance, then they will have to be attacked also to end our oppression.
The props which support this establishment must be attacked simply because their is no option, given the nature of the oppression in emenating from the establishment, in exchanging a white set of oppressors for a black one. That is why schemes like ""Black Capitalism"" have not caught on in the black community; that is why some young black people are currently persuing a formal education while rejecting to the normal success oriented end goal of it.
Black people have always existed--and barely at that--at the sufferance of the government establishment of the United States.
That was true when nearly 100 years ago when the civil war ended and we thought we have a chance at determining our own destinies. It is happening now at the end of a similar era of ] 4 hope and limited progress.
(here insert all of page 6, 7 and first 2 paragraphs from page 8 of attached speech) + para 2 on pg 9.
This country first tried to use Christianity as a rational basis for the exploitation of black men. Civilising the heathen by stealing him from his family, and his home, raping his women, scattering his family was the Christian thing to do, giving rise to the popular expression that when missionaries came to Africa, they had the Bible and we had the land; when they left, we had the Bible and they had the land and they also had us and have never let us go.
3
Nothing so complicated as Christianity was needed for long, howevr; race is observable, while religion isn""t, and iIt has been class v.s. class and race against race violently and nonviolently in this county from the 17th century to this one.
It will probably continue to be that. What is discussable for today's purposes is not whether it will continue to be that, but how the question will be put in the future. What responses will those in power make? Will the establishment absorb again, as it does so well, those who rail against it?
The question of race will be continuously increasingly put to the establishment on violent terms. This will not be the heated mass ] 7 violence of Watts and Detroit and Newark, but rather the violence that has begun to terrorize draft centers from coast to coasts, the violence that has every white big city policeman more nervous and jumpy than he has ever been. In effect The natives - some few of them, a small, small number, are become guerillas, and the colonial administrators are becoming worried.
I do not suggest urge, or even condone, that blacks begin campaigns of violence and terror aimed at the obvious symbols of the establishment, but that despite urging or condemnation by anyone, this will be the case. The day of wholesale looting and burning is passed, not because radical changes resulted from it but because it is easier to attack two policemen at a time than it is to attack 200; it is easier and less costly in human life to destroy a downtown credit reference bureau than it is to single out and destroy his its colonial outpost in the ghetto; the records are downtown and not in the ghetto, anyway. ] 8
While this activity occurs, and it is occuring now, every' week in some part of the country, rather more standardized activity will be occuring as well.
This is to say that the whole range of black activism will continue, from picket lines to voter registration drives to student disruptions to marches to draft refusals and to every other form of protest tried during the last decade.
What will be different in the future, however, is not just that black men want the regularity blue collar security of a union card, or that black young people want a formal college education, but that the young and some of the old, both black and white, and determined to follow the slogan of Eldridge Cleaver - if you are not part of the solution, you're part of the problem. And none of them wants now - or ever - to be a part of the problem. ] 9
Some will be, of course. The rewards of moderation are too great; the difficulty of the struggle is too exacting. But there is being produced, on the campu and in the streets, a new breed of young people for whom a generation gap is not 20 or 25 years, but from this year's graduating class to the next. TheNational Student Association, in research collected during one two months of the last school year, discovered that 16,000 college students had been arrested for smoking marijuana. Smoking pot is not always revolutionary action, but it is anti-establishment, and I want to suggest that the 16,000 is a small visibletip of a large and hidden iceberg.
This iceberg, unlike others, gets larger, rather than smaller, and it includes not just those who smoke illegally have dates with Mary Jane, but those who have decided not to accept - and to show they do not accept - the same old bill of goods.
The war in Vietnam to them is not an aberration that has lately gone wrong; for them, and they are right, it was never right. White Racism, to them, has been an American constant, not something discovered by Senator Fred Harris and John Lindsey and former Governor Kerner; sex is something to be enjoyed, outdoors in the middle of the street, if you will, and not a hidden exercise in guilt.
The violence and the mindlessness that accompanies these ideas may not be attractive, but it can never equal the violence dispensed by those who now [worry] on what is called the other side.
So these young people may continue to grow in numbers as the discover that the old ways don't work. They are not the first ] 11 generation to make this discovery, but they are certainly the first generation to begin the process of withdrawal from establishment ranks while constructing their own alternative to it.
They are, you may say, constructing their own establishment, but surely it will not and cannot be the same thing. Surely it will aim away from profit oriented labor, and toward a new and yet undefined ethic that will insist on putting into practice what is now merely a slogan, doing your own thing.
A French student in Paris chants ""We are all German Jews."" A black girl at Tougaloo College in Mississippi writes: ""The sharecropper is me, the domestic is me.""
They are determined to make a better world or know the reason why. They are determined, and they are marching straight from the pages of Tom Hayden's testimony earlier this year before ] 12 the House Committee on Un-American Activities.
Hayden, said then: 
""We are going to win either way. The Chicago Convention brutality was a tremendous kind of victory for the young peop,e of this country who are not voters, people who are not polled by Gallup or Harris, but people who do watch television, and do not identify with the young Nixon girls or David Eisenhower, but identify with the young people in the streets, and who watch very carefully. If you think you have had militant people before you in these hearings, you have yet to see what the seven and eight years olds are going to bring you in the next five to ten years.
""You have taught them to have no respect for authority, and that is a victory in the sense that committees like yourselves are through. You exist only formally; you exist officially, but you have lost all authority, and qhen a group of people who have power lose their authority, they have lost. You have lost period.""
I believe that is the epitath for establishments. They have lost, period.

In 1969, as in the years past, the United States of America and her people discover themselves in a curious position.
We have, for example, imposed 500,000 soldiers on a small, faraway country, spending [illegible] 30 billion dollars a year to instruct them in the virtues of American democracy, at the point of a gun. We have interfered with a legitimate revolution in that country.
Back at home, Black and white young people have discovered that their education intended to prepare them to become managers of the new technological society; they rebelled against it, and will probably continue to do so as the school year wears on.
They may find some difficulty as they do - over half of the fifty states have passed repressive and anti-student
2
legislation; one state describes a riot as any disturbance caused by three or more people. Another has passed legislation absolving policemen of guilt in any riot deaths or injuries, but declares equally guilty any person at the scene of a riot where a policeman is injured or killed.
The Congress of the United States, shortly before hearing President Nixon propose that the welfare poor be given payments of $1600 a year for a family of four, decided not to eliminate the welfare programs paid to American farmers but instead tried to set a floor limit of only $20,000 a year per farm.
The facts for Black people are more frightening; we are not only not closing failing to close the gap between Black and white, we are falling farther behind.
3
For example, the income of the average white American family has increased by one hundred percent over the past twenty years; so has the income of the typical Black family.  But twenty years ago, our average family income was half of that for whites; today, white income is growing twice as fast as ours.
Our housing is probably more segregated now than ever before. The United States Commission on Civil Rights has said that if all Americans lived in conditions as crowded as do the Black people in some sections of Harlem, then all 200 million Americans could live in three of the five boroughs of New York, leaving the other two and all of the rest of the United States totally unpopulated.
4
Four out of every five Americans are more affluent than any other people in history. They have reached that .affluence by degrading the fifth person, the poor Black Americans, brown Americans and white Americans who have neither the power nor resources to effectively complain about their lot.
Our welfare system taxes the poor more than our tax system taxes the rich. A poor man on welfare must pay the government 70 cents on every dollar he earns above $30 a month; a rich man pays the government only 25 cents on every dollar he wins on the stock market.
Half of the farmers in the United States -- the half who have incomes of less than $2,500 a year -- received five percent of the farm subsidies provided by the government. Ten percent of the farmers in the United States received sixty percent of the subsidies. 
5
Some Americans of thirty years ago were afraid that we might become a welfare state. Instead, we have become a warfare state. Our nation gives 80% of its wealth to the Pentagon, and ten percent to health, education, and welfare.
We have come gradually, I think, to this point in our history because of several factors. Over the years the United States has strengthened, rather than relinquished, its role as policeman of the world.
Over the years racism in the United States has strengthened rather than relinquished, its role as policeman of the world.
Over the years racism in the United States has strengthened, rather than weakened.
Today's tragedy is compounded because those who can offer some hope have chosen to fight their battles elsewhere. 
6
What is happening now happened once again in American history in the year s after Reconstruction[.] tThe promises of that that Black people would be included in the social and economic life of the nation, were repudiated. Instead of fulfilling the dream, then and now: 
- the white crusaders for social justice and democracy became weary as Black people could no longer be considered a purely Southern problem;
- the aspirations for and movement of Blacks began to be curtailed by organized violence and barbarity and by a series of legal manuevers designed to make Black men less than political and economic equals.
7
- the hopes and belief of Black people that racial equality and social justice could be achieved through litigation, legislation, negotiation, occasional direct action and strong alliances with ] 5 white liberal groups were supplanted by disillusionment, bitterness and open anger.
- the guilt and indignation of Northern supporters of the Southern drive for equality turned into an attitude of cautious - and now open - racism when the Northern Black man began to take seriously the claims of progress and began to look for visible signs in Northern cities.*
Those who directed the movement from lunch counters to bus stations to voting booths to electoral politics are no longer there.
8
Those Northerners whose concern and whose money helped finance that movement are no longer concerned or financial.
The government we once thought sympathetic to our goals is either no longer the government or is no longer sympathetic.
Instead there are a few workers plodding the cotton fields of Mississippi and the bayous of Louisiana and the red hills of Georgia trying to organize a movement. Instead, there are scattered student concern at this school or that one, while the millions in the ghetto go uncared for, unheeded and unattended except by policemen and occasionally national guardsmen.
Instead, a battle some thought was won at the lunch counter is being lost at the ballot box and in the county courthouse.
The battle for the integrated school room seat is being lost today, not by night riders or burning crosses but by diplomacy in Washington, and by the illicit and adulterous relationship between the
9
President and the Cinderella Bridegroom and notorious land speculator from South Carolina. The same forces - and the runaway textile mill, the cotton picking machine, working the anti-Black conspiracy in labor unions, the new welfarism proposed by the President to subsidize employers, all these combine to insure that Blacks get less than our share of what we ought to have.
The nation which now spends thirty billion a year to interfere in the political future of fourteen million Vietnamese and less than one tenth that amount to insure a decent future for twenty seven million poor Black and white Americans now tells us that if the war ends today, we will not have thirty billion for domestic affairs but only eight billion.
In short, war spending will continue while we look for new worlds to conquer.

In the meantime, the poor . . Black and white . . will have to wait.
But of course, many do not choose to wait. Black people in the cities began restructuring the American slum long before college students began restructuring the American university.
Black people in the South, long believers in the power and the majesty of the federal government, have decided that if they do not do for themselves, no one will do for them.
They have organized political and economic units responsive to them, and will continue their battle alone if they must.
They do cry out for help, however. They need the abilities and idealism of the young, and they need it where they are, not where the students are.
11
They need to have the expertise that is available in academia, and they need the hearts and minds and bodies that are available on every campus.
They need to build their own future, but they need help to do it.
A poet, Margaret Rigg, expressed what is needed:
""Face possible end of business as usual stop white silence in America
Stop kidding stop killing stop mace stop foam stop police arms race
Stop napalm stop bombing stop bloodletting stop Nixon stop sleeping
Stop dreaming stop crying stop mumbling stop now begin again begin
12
Beginning begin hearing begin seeing begin trying begin doing begin 
Working begin working hard begin organizing begin being human begin 
Living begin being possible begin facing the possible surprise of your own voice begin.
Beginning again reads nicely as a poem; for our lives it requires something more than reading nicely. It requires a realization that we have not overcome, that our enemies are not against the wall, and that tomorrow will not be a better day.
It requires constant attention to the problems of today, to racism, to hunger and to war.
13
It requires that those least affected and least involved - the great mass of middle class Americans, white and Black - involve themselves.
It requires finally the feeling that there is something to be won and a way to win it, the notion that change does not occur by hoping or wishing and the realization that life can get better for some people sometime if they those who want it so will work to make it so.
If that does not occur, then we are poorer for it, and will suffer because of it.
For as Frederick Douglass said: ""We are here, and here we are likely to be. To imagine that we shall ever be eradicated is absurd and ridiculous. We may be remodified, changed,
14
assimilated, but never extinguished. We repeat that we are here and this is our country . . . . We shall neither die out nor be driven out; but shall go with this people, either as testimony against them, or as an evidence in their favor throughout their generations.""

[The following is typeset.]
In 1968 the United States finds itself moving towards destruction.
This nation has imposed 500,000 soldiers on a small faraway country. It has tried to impose American values and American ways on the people of that country, and has nearly destroyed them in the process. It has intefered with a legitimate, localized revolution in that nation, and is destroying that nation in the process.
At home, white and black young people battle policemen for control of the streets, for control of schools, for control of lives, for control of property.
Our Congress, which without difficulty raises more than $80 billion of dollars for war every year, providing guaranteed annual incomes for munitions merchants, cannot bring itself to consider guaranteed annual incomes for the poor.
We black people find ourselves in the curious position of being better off now than we were tirty years ago, but being worse off in every way - economically, educationally, politically - in in comparison with white America than ever before.
Black people make less money in relation to white people than ever before; there are more [illegible] black people out of work - in comparison to white people - than ever before - and there are more black people fighting and dying in America's armed services in comparison with white people than ever before.
We are [illegible] paying a heavy price for integration.
Our housing is probably more segregated now than ever before. The United States Commission on Civil Rights has said that if all Americans lived in conditions
as crowded as do the black people iin some sections of Harlem, then all 200 million Americans could live in three of the five boroughs of New York, leaving the other two and all the rest of the United States totally unpopulated.
[illegible]
We see the leaders of our nation condemning the Russians for having done what we have done in Vietnam.
2
""The fact that a small nation lives within reach of a large nation does not mean that that large nation is entitled to move in on it to reorganize its internal affairs.""
That was Secretary of State Dean Rusk speaking, and oddly enough, the large nation was not the United States re-organizing Vietnam, but Russia re-organizing Czechoslovakia.
Four [illegible] out of every five Americans are more affluent than any other people in country history. They have reached that affluence by degrading the fith person, the poor black Americans, brown Americans and white Americans who have neither the power or resources to complain about their lot.
Our welfare system taxes the poor more than our tax system taxes the rich. A poor man on welfare must pay the giverment 70 cents on every dollar he earns above $30 a month; a rich man pays the government only 25 cents on every dollar he wins on the stock market.
Half of the farmers in the United States - the half who have incomes of less than $2,500 - received 5% of the farm subsidies provided by the government. 10% of the farmers in the United States received 60% of the subsidies.
Some Americans of thirty years ago were afraid that we might become a welfare state. Instead, we have become a warfare state. Our nation gives 80% of its [illegible] wealth to the Pentagon, and 10% to health, education, and welfare.
We have come gradually, I think, to this point in our history because of several factors. Over the years the United States has strengthened, rather than relinquished, its role as police of the world.
Over the years racism in the United States has remained, rather than weakened. And most importantly for us, over the years liberals and radicals have continued to
argue rather than cooperate, to the detriment of both liberal, radical, and reformist movements in the United States.
3
A good example of the diviseness and the lack of stick-to-itive-ness on the left can be found in the South. Those who began a student revolution there eight years ago - a revolution that spread to Berkeley and to Columbia - are no longer there.
Those who directed the movement from lunch counters to bus stations to voting booths to electoral politics are no longer there.
Those Northerners whose concern and whose money helped finance that movement are no loger concerned or financial.
The government we once thought sympathetic to our goals is either no lonegr the government or is no longer sympathetic.
Instead there are a few workers plodding the cotton field of Mississippi and the Bayous of Louisiana and the red hills of George trying to organize a movement.
Instead, there are scattered student concern at this school or that one, while the millions in the ghetto go uncared for, unheeded and unattended except by policemen
and occasionally National Guardsmen.
Instead, a battle some thought was won at the lunch counter is being lost at the ballot box and in the county courthouse.
The battle for the integrated schoolrom seat is being lost, not by devious legal action or oppressive night riders, but by the cotton picking machine, the run-away textile mill, the right to work laws which keep poor men poor, and make children go so hungry they cannot learn, and so naked they cannot attend school.
We are passing now through the annual American political season. The road shows are on tour. There are two main attractions, produced by two companies, but they speak from the same script.
The title of this year's extravanza is ""Law and Action,"" or ""How to Sell Out to The South Without Once Saying Nigger.""
One play is directed by Strom Thurmond, the other by Richard Daley. In one play Mr. Thurmond also acts to remind the hero of his lines; in the other,
[Missing page number]
a prompter from Texas is always standing in the wings to remind the leading men if he forgets his part.
In some parts of the country there will be alternatives for both the left and the right, but the right is the winner in this year's election because it has three candidates to choose from.
Those on the left can choose or of course make no choice at all. To do the latter will make one feel purer, of course, but to opt out altogether leaves something to be disered.
There is an obvious longing in America for change, and that longing is shared not just by blacks in the cities and students on the campus but by millions of housewives and farmers and laborers and others.
The job of the liberal and the job of the radical is to put those people and their longing together.
When Robert Kennedy announced his candidacy [illegible] some of us cringed. He's ruthless, we said, or he was a bad attorney general, we said, or its a plot by President Johnson, we said.
But [illegible] no one who saw black people in Watts scrambling for his hand or who saw white farmers in Alabama smiling at his jokes could believe that for long, and no-one who saw the miles and miles of mourners from New York to Washington could rebember old tales or harbor old grudges.
When Eugene McCarthy, months before Kennedy, announced his candidacy, we said its only a trick. We said he just wants to get us off the streets and into the syatem. We said he wants to kill the student movement.
But no one who saw the students in New Hampshire could believe that student movements are dead, and no one who saw the battle of Conrand Hilton in Chicago can believe McCarthy got the students off the streets.
These two campaigns, for all their failures and their tragis losses, brought
4 [Seems to be mis-numbered?]
to America the fervor and the feeling that had not existed since the Freedom Rides of 1961; that had not existed since the sit-in demonstrations of 1960; that had not existed since the March on Washington in 1963.
These moments in history, representing no accomplishment but only people in motion, signified a beginning.
That beginning is best told in a poem by a woman named Margaret Rigg:
Face the possible end of business as usual stop white silence in America
stop kidding stop killing stop mac stop foam stop police arms race
stop napalm stop bombing stop bloodletting stop nixon stop sleeping
stop dreaming stop crying stop mumbling stop now begin again begin
beginning begin hearing begin seeing begin trying begin dooing begin
working begin working hard begin organizing begin being human begin
living begin being [illegible] possible begin facing the possible surprise
of your own voice begin.
Beggining again reads nicely as a poem; for our livesm it requires something more than reading nicely. It requires a realization that we have not overcome, that our enemies are not against the wall, and thattomorrow will not be a better day.
It requires constant attention to the problems of today, to racism, to hunger and to war.
It requires some form of unity among those who insist on a better day, rather than one hundred different drummers beating different tunes.
It requires that those least affected and least involved - the great mass of middle class Americans, white and black - involve themselves.
It requires that action replace slogan, and it requires that rhetoric be replaced with reality.
It requires finally a committment - the committment that might have kept
5 [Seems to be mis-numbered]
the South in ferment; the committment that would have kept Chicago's police force busy; a committment that might have insured a choice and not a echo on the top of the ballot in November.
And it will require that each of us keep in mind a prohecy written by the later Langston Hughes - that dreams defferred do explode.
For if this dream is deferred much longer, then an explosion will come - and in the words of the old song it will be like God [illegible] giving Noah the rainbow sign; now more water, the fire next time.

[Speech]
As we muddle through the first year of the decade of the '70s, there seems to be intense confusion in American life.
It is not as though we don't know what the problems are; it is simply that we either do not know how to solve them, or haven't got the will to do so.
For black Americans, our realities remain the same, and we wonder why other Americans cannot at least marginally share our discomfort at our position.
The truth is that we constitute a colonial people within these United States, and are being forced to employ the traditional methods and techniques of the [illegible] colonial subject to escape from the oppression of the colonial power.
There are objections made to the description of ""us"" and ""you"" as components in the colonial equation; we are told that we are nationalized Americans, not a people of separate identity; We are told that the Constitution that governs us all supports equal citizenship, and that our second-class status is a matter of chance, not design. And we are told that the racism which affects us is based on historical preference and not economic profit, as it has been in the traditional version of African, Asian or Latin American colonialism.
No one can deny that we are all citizens, at least in the sense that we all must meet certain obligations owed to the state. We pay taxes, and so do you, but because more of us are poor, and because the poor pay more, we pay more of our share and reap fewer of the benefits. Black and white men alike are subjected to the opportunity to serve this country militarily, but through this present
2
attack by this country on people of Southeast Asia, we have managed to become first in war, last in peace, and seldom in the hearts of our countrymen.
Your ancestors and mine both came to this country as immigrants, but yours came voluntarily, seeking freedom and a chance to survive. Mine came in chains, husband torn from wife, child from mother. In a land where family and education are venerated, we were denied the chance to learn and to maintain a family unit. In a country peopled with sufferers from religious prosecution, you forced your strange and alien religion upon us.
While we came from a nation of people who believed in communalism, you created here a system of mercantile capitalism that suited your cashbox mentality.
The separate status of black people in this society has been a fact since the first African was dragged, kicking, to these shores. From that day to this, you are the Europeans, and we the Africans.
The argument is also made that blacks enjoy legal protection here as do all citizens, a base lie if ever a lie was told.
The Constitution of the United States outlaws barriers to voting and other forms of social participation, but these are still subjected to intense debate in the Southern states, in part of the North, and so we are lead to believe, in the White House itself.
In short, we are in bad shape. We live and work in situations provided for by the majority, not by us. We exist at the sufferance of the American majority, and the evidence is mounting
3

that that existence itself may soon be called into question.
The traditional solutions to our dillema - solutions employed with great success by others ethnic groups - will not mold themselves entirely to our deliverance.
Individual entrepreneurship has created a class of black millionaires in publishing, insurance, and the cosmetic fields, but has done little for most black people.
Pressure group politics has won many needed reforms for our group, but these reforms are impossible to make secure in a colonial society.
We had believed, for instance, that the battle for the integrated school-room seat was won back in 1954, with only slight pressure needed from then to finish the job.
The truth was that none of the administrations in Washington since then - particularly including this one - ever intended to make the dream of an integrated education a reality.
The traditional coalitions of black people, labor, the more enlightened church leadership have failed in bringing about the beloved society that was the dream of the early '60s.
The American labor movement has shown its true colors as black people began demanding not only labor connected goals like minimum wages, but entry into the craft unions which have always been lily white. The churches have unfortunately played a gad-about role, black people today, the war in Vietnam tomorrow, abortion reform the next.
The hoped for coalition with white college students has
4
not materialized, as this group has shown more interest in music, drugs, the romance of revolution and self enforced poverty than in the human problems which affect every black person in this country.
So we are left to an ever spiraling scale of politics and then protest and then revolt, with the probable result that increasing repression will follow.
Here is a description of the process:
""The people with fewest illusions about the welafre state are the poor who are served by it. When they protest, usually in the name of American ideals, an interesting reaction follows. Some among the majority react sympathetically, though not always with real understanding of the causes. But a sufficient number of opposing interests are aroused to prevent and drastic change, and often even moderate changes are blocked. The poor, who in most cases begin by politely petitioning their governors, soon take more drastic steps, thinking they can perhaps awaken the conscience of the majority or at least of higher authorities. They do awaken the conscience of some people, and to some extent they force elites to concede token changes. But at the same time, a 'counterrevolution' is triggered against the potential of revolution which has been seen in the mounting protest. The system becomes deadlocked. No more than token reforms, crumbs, result for the protestors. The scale of their protest increases as they realize that appeals to conscience are inadequate. They look for methods of transcending the pressure politics that have not worked. They begin civil disobedience and
5
disruption. The immediate reaction of the power structure is to maintain order. The police are bought into the conflict. Considerations of social, political or economic solutions to the conflict are gradually replaced by the emphasis on law and order. Violent repression becomes routine.""*
It becomes clear that the only escape from this trap is revolution, either violent on the part of both sides of the question, or a revolution in thinking and psychology and political position on both sides of the question.
It is that second revolution that is bursting upon us today.
It springs, first of all, from the black community. It is a revolution in thinking about ourselves, a revolution turning upside down the analysis that had made us - the victims - describe ourselves as the causes on our own condition.
It is found most concretely in the growing desire among black people to reject the kind of tribalization of class and geography that has divided us for so long, and to bring us together as a nation within this nation.
It is found in the rejection by black people of white standards of beauty and competence that have plagued us for so long.
But we will not do the job alone. We may - as we are slowly about to do - take over the major cities of this country
6
and hold them as enclaves against increasing repression, charging admission fees to suburban whites who must come to the city for jobs and income, and who must depend on the city as a source of police protection and utility service.
But we would like to depend on white America as a source of simple decency of treatment, a hope that many would call extremely niaeve.
We would like, for example, to be treated as well as American farmers are. First they were given free lands. Then they were given low interest loans to enable them to buy farm machinery. Then the Department of Agriculture sent out farm agencts to show them how to use their machines and to rotate their crops. Now we pay them not to do anything, a form of millionaire welfarism that is scorned for poor people.
Suppose, for example, that an ADC mother was paid not to produce at the same rate that gentleman farmer Senator James O. Eastland is. That would mean that welafre mothers in Detroit or Chicago or Los Angeles could collect as much as $125,000 a year for not having babies.
But the revolution demands that we be allowed not more than but simply the same as other groups. Why must patronage be abolished as a political reward when blacks take over the cities after it has done so much for Italians and Irishmen? Why must good government advocate metropolitanism as a panacea to urban ills at a time when we threaten to take over urban America?
7
Why must women - most of them white - and homosexuals - most of them white - and other groups insist that our liberation is dependent on ours?
The answer must be that no one - unless it is American Indians - has priority over the justifiable demands of black people. And that only black people can set the pace, techniques and methods used by black people in our struggle.
Foremost among these must be political action, but not the old style of machine politics or the black - labor coalition that we have entered into like a willing bridegroom so many times in the past, only to emerge ravished and our innocence gone.
Our politics must be an agressive independent politics, free from any alliances of party or partisanship that has made us slaves first to the party of Lincoln and then to the party of Roosevelt.
We must begin to seize power where we are, in the cities and the black belt counties of the Old Confederacy. As whites flee these areas for the comfort and security of the suburbs, they create a political vacuum that we must fill.
But the cities are crumbling beneath us, and the prescence of black a black major will not insure that these decaying compounds will be liveable again.
The black inhabitants of rural of America have a better chance at achieving a decent life, for the cost of living is lower there and the people know better how to live, but even these victors will discover that political gains can be destroyed by an economy that still remains in the hands of the plantation bosses.
8
So as we get our politics together, we must try to get our economics together as well. This means that while we reject the obviously absurb Nixonian notion of black capitalism, we must not hesitate to accept any economic advantage that might accrue to our group as a whole.
This means striving for economic plans as different as the designs plotted by the Honorable Elijah Muhhamad in the South to the neighborhood cooperatives springing up in ghettoes across the country to the transfer of mom-and-pop stores from white hands to black ones as well as any other plan or scheme that will put money into the pockets of black people.
Finally, we must prepare for a time of trouble. If the provisions of the inane Washington, D. C. no-knock law are any indication of what is in store for us in the future, and if the Gate-mouthed Maryland-farmer who presides over the Senate is to continue his rantings in concert with the little tyrant who runs the FBI, then we might begin to take seriously the advice offered by John E. Bruce, a black journalist of the 1880s who proposed:
""The man who will not fight for the protection of his wife and children is a coward, and deserves to be ill treated. The man who takes his life in his hands and stands up for what he knows is right will always command the respect of his enemy. .......
""Under the present condition of affairs the only hope, the only salvantion for the Negro is to be found in a resort to force under wise and discreet leaders. He must sooner or later come to this........
9
""(We) must not be rash or indescreet either in action or words but (we) must be very determined and terribly in ernest.......
""Under Mosaic law it was the custom to require an eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth under a no less barbarous civilisation than that which existed at that period of the world's history; 'let the Negro require at the hands of every white murderer in the South or elsewhere a life for a life. If they burn our houses, burn theirs, if they kill our wives and children, kill theirs, pursue them relentlessly, meet force with force everywhere it is offered. If they demand blood, exchange it with them, until they are satiated.............
""Organized resistance to organized resistence is the best remedy for the solution of the vexed problem of the century which to me seems practicable and feasible, and I submit this view of the question, ladies and gentlemen, for your careful consideration.""✻"

[The following is handwritten on a piece of scrap paper and paperclipped to the speech with blue ink.] 
REMOVAL PUNISHABLE BY CAPITAL MEANS! 
Do NOT send this copy out of office —

Fellow delegates, fellow Democrats, fellow Americans -- we are here in the midst of trying and difficult times -- times which challenge our party, our country, and the future of democracy itself.
Right at the moment as I speak, the Chicago police are beating and clubbing demonstrators outside the Conrad-Hilton hotel.
I am here today to second the nomination of the man who has spoken out most clearly and strongly about the challenge of 1968, the man who has spelled out for all Americans the changes we need to meet that challenge, the man who has begun already to lead us toward a new day in American politics -- Senator Eugene Mc Carthy of Minnesota.
If it were not for Senator Mc Carthy we would be meeting here under very different conditions today.
[The following word is handwritten in the right margin.] Challenge
We would not have an open convention -- we would have merely an echo of 1964.
We would not be testing our own procedures -- because the new forces of American politics, the people who are demanding full democracy in every aspect of American life, would be working outside the Democratic Party. would not be here and they are here, tonight
We would not be considering our national priorities -- we would be rubber stamping the policies of the past four years.
And above all, we would not have had a national judgment on the war in Vietnam -- an overwhelming rejection of a war the American people never chose and never supported -- a rejection of the way we have carried on that war, a rejection of the role of the military in our foreign policy, a rejection of empty slogans and misleading propoganda.
2
The American people are demanding a fundamental change -- that, I think, is the great lesson of the campaign of 1968. They are demanding an end to the politics of unfulfilled promises and exaggeration, an end to the politics of manipulation and control.
They know they will not get that change from the Republican Party. The Miami Convention made that very clear. The question now -- the great question of 1968 -- is whether our own this party -- the party which has always been claimed to be the party of the people -- can now respond to the will of the people. The question is whether we will give them the one man whose name is synonymous with a new politics of 1968 and a new hope for America.
All over the world, 1968 is a year in which people have been raising up and demanding freedom -- from Biafra to Georgia, from Czechoslovakia to Chicago. It is a year of the little people — students
It is a year of the little people -- students and teachers, Black and white workers and housewives. All over the world people want to be free to speak and to move about, free to protest and to be heard, free to live honorable lives and most of all, free to participate in the politics which affect their lives.
That is the freedom we have been seeking seek tonight through the Democratic Party in 1968.
4 3
Don't tell us we are going to get that freedom through the policies of the past -- for the American people are rejecting those policies.
Don't tell us we are going to get that freedom from the leaders of the past -- because they don't even understand what we are talking about.
For me, and for millions of Democrats and Independents, millions of young people and Black people and poor people, there is one candidate who understands. There is one candidate who has lived it day by day.
That man is Gene Mc Carthy. And he is the only candidate who can win for us in 1968. He is the only candidate who can win because he is the only candidate whom the American people can believe in.
He is the only candidate who is saying now what he said in November. He is the only candidate who refuses to say the easy thing or the simple thing. He is our last hope in L(¢* 1968 for a president who will tell the truth to the American people.
Before Gene Mc Carthy came along, the young people of America thought that our country was gripped by violence and hatred -- and that nothing could be done. But Gene Mc Carthy put our young people to work for America.
4
When others held back, Gene Mc Carthy assumed that there could be dialogue in America --- that there could be talk between young and old, Black and white, rich and poor. And there was talk, there was debate, there was full and free discussion in our land.
When others held back, Gene Mc Carthy assumed that the American people could bear the truth -- and we learned that not only could they bear it --- they were hungry for truth, starving for frankness and honesty, and hoping and praying for a candidate who would speak freely and openly.
When others held back, Gene Mc Carthy assumed that the American people could pass a judgment. And we have seen that judgment passed.
We have seen all that is best in America demanding an end to the immoral war in Vietnam and a full committment to all those who are excluded in our country, to all those who are injured and insulted, to all who go hungry and powerless in the midst of affluence and luxury.
Americans of good faith now realize there is one candidate who has never spoken on the side of repression and violence, one candidate who has spoken never promised more than he could fulfill, one candidate who has spoken quietly and steadily of bringing together Black people and white people to make a new start in this country. One candidate who has stood for generosity and humanity toward the smaller nations of the world.
5
And that candidate is Gene Mc Carthy.
Fellow delegates, the people of America are watching us now --- as indeed the whole world is watching us. They are looking to the Democratic Party to honor their faith in democracy. They are waiting and watching for a new kind of honesty in American politics.
After all that has happened in 1968, after all we have done and all we have learned -- can we afford to abandon Gene Mc Carthy? Can we deny the American people the chance to vote for the one man who has made a difference -- in our party, in our politics and in the direction of our country?
The choice we make will be long remembered. It is not too late to look once more within ourselves. It is not too late to give the best we have.
It is not too late to get ourselves together and to nominate a man who is already one of our greatest leaders -- a man who will become in time one of our greatest presidents.
I am proud to second the nomination of Senator Eugene J. Mc Carthy.

Dear Professor Bond:
I would very much like to buy, beg, borrow, or steal one or more copies of the speech made by your son at the Democratic National Convention when he placed in nomination the name of Reverend Channing Phillips.
I am teaching a graduate seminar in Afro-American Literature in the Fall, and I would like to have my students read that speech as a part of the course requirement. Frankly, I consider it the best piece of oratory to come out of the last national election.
I would not have troubled you with this request, but Professor Earl Lewis of our Urban Studies Department suggested that writing to you, might, in the end, be a more direct means of communication than attempting to get in touch with your son through the Georgia State Legislature.
Sincerely,

[The following speech has gaps in content and repeated page numbers. It has been transcribed as it appears in the manuscript pages.]
If education is a socializing process, in our society it has prepared white people to continue enjoying priviledged traditions and positions, while black people, through it, have been programmed for social and economic oblivion.
The crisis in race that exists on the college campus is of course only a reflection of a larger, more serious crisis in the country, and indeed throughout the world.
The roots of the crisis are as old as the world itself; they involve the continuing failure of the white minority of peoples of this world to share power and wealth and the non-white majority.
That struggle has been in the streets of every city in this country, both violently and non-violently. It is a part of the struggle that inspired Fidel Castro to overthrow and dictator in Cuba, and it is the same struggle that is inspiring the patriots of Vietnam to continue, successfully, it seems, their twenty-year-old struggle to resist foreign domination of the homeland.
That it should come to the college campus is not at all ] 2 unusual; here, after all, are the people who have been told since the day they graduated from high school that the earth is theirs for the taking, that they are in the inheritors of tomorrow. Who is to blame if they believe it? That it is spreading downward into high schools and even elementary schools is not surprising either.
2
It ought not be surprising that young people who learned how to organize the poor and powerless in the Mississippi Delta would transfer their expertise to the powerless at Berkeley and Cornell.
And it ought not be surprising that race has played a large part in the struggles on the campus today, as race has played a large part in the continuing struggle of man against man.
To tie today's on-campus unrest only to yesterday's off-campus protests is unreal, however. Ther is a great deal more at stake than that.
A great deal has been made by some scholars and pollsters ] 3 of the difference in the demands of black and white students activists. The whites want revolution, the experts say, while all the blacks want, despite their revolutionary rhetoric, is reform, a chance to bend the established system to their own ends, which are as safe and as ordinary as those shared by the rest of middle-class America.
Therein lies, I think, the conflict present in the black mind on the American campus. The black student is torn between the need for a regular, formal education, part of the socialization process that we are told everyone needs in order to seek an acceptable role in society, and his need to carve out a new education experience, one that is meaningful that is meaningful to him as a black person. In other words, if
A young girl, a student at Tougaloo College in Mississippi, summed up this feeling when she wrote of her reaction to learning that Tougaloo and Brown University had entered into an educational ] 4 4 compact, with Brown acting as Big Brother.
3
""We argued,"" she wrote, ""that Tougaloo could do better, that we did not have to pattern ourselves after Brown or any of the Ivy League schools, that we had a unique opportunity to make Tougaloo a revolutionary institute of learning. We questioned the notion that places like Brown offered a superior education; we felt in fact that if schools like Brown had had been they dealt in mid-education. We felt that if schools like Brown had been truly educating their students then the state of the country and the world would be a lot different.""
The dillema of whether to change the Tougaloos of the world or the to get what can be gotten from the Browns is the continung one. among young blacks.
The demand for a Black dorm or an Afro-American center is a part of that dillemna. The unscholarly attacks on black educational ] 5 institutions by scholars who should know better are part of that dillema.
So the current and future course for those blacks interested in solving - or rather eliminating - the crisis of race is unclear.
The first is to realize that all one can reveice from an education today is how much one does not know, how powerless we all are,
One has to realize that it is educated and civilised man who has put us where we are today. The rape of Vietnam was not begun by high school drop outs, but by liberally educated men. The pollution of the air and water is not carried out by fools and idiots, but by men educated at the best scientific and technical centers. The ability to shape a society that spends nearly one hundred billions on conquering space and dominating the globe militarily comes from men of
2 3
Civilised man, or educated man, is susposed to solve his problems in a civilisezd manner.
But the problems of the twentieth century are so vast that many have quite properly been urged to seek un-civilised solutions to them. These problems include the poisioning of the air and water; the rape of the land; the new colonialization of peoples, both here and abroad; the new imperialism practiced by Western Demorcacy, and the continuing struggle of those who have not against those who have.
A great American black man, a scholar and author, the late Dr. W. E. B. DuBois, once wrote that the problem of the twentieth century is the problem of the color line.
We later restated this to include the problem of the priviledged against the powerless, the problem and the struggle of the powerful against the dispossessed.
With the birth, two hundred years ago, of the collosus called the United States, rational and educated men began to believe that civilisation stretched to its highest order had begun. Building on a heritage of revolution, [illegible] expressing a belief in the equality of most, if not all men, this new democracy was to be the ] 7 highest elevation of man's relations, one to the others, and a new beginning of decency between nations.
Civilization, as it was then defined, included imposing limitations on war between nations, encouraging the spread of industrialization, the civilizating of so-called heathen elements, the harnessing of nature
3 4
for the benefit and pleasure of man. It was believed generally that man's better nature would triumph over his base desire to conquer and rule and make war, and that intellect, reason and logic would share equally with morality in deciding man's fate.
Of course it has not been so. Man still makes war, he still insists that one group subordinate its wishes and desires to that of another, he still insists on gathering material wealth at the expense of his fellows and his environment. ] 8
Men and nations have grown arrogant, and the struggle of the 20th Century has continued.
And while the struggle has continued, the University has remained aloof, a center for the study of why man behaves as he does, but never a center for the study of how to make man behave in a civilised manner.
Robert M. Hutchins, former Chancellor of the University of Chicago, describes the present day university thusly:
It was hoped ""It would lead the way to national power and prosperity.... become the central factory of the knowledge industry, the foundation of our future. (But it became) . . . the national screening device through which individuals were to be out in the proper productive relationship to the national program of power and prosperity.""
(But) the world has moved too fast for the university. ] 9 The leaders of the younger generation see that the problem is not to get wealth and power; (nations) have enough of those already. The problem is justice, or what to do with wealth and power. An institution that
4 5
evidently has little interest in this question cannot command the allegiance of the young.""
That the allegiance of some of the young is not with the University but with the oppressed and downtrodden is evident. Every continent has seen its young rise up against the evils the University is susposed to teach them how to destroy, and many have risen up against the University itself.
[Instead of then] Despite its goal of producing individuals who know their relationship to be managers of the new industrial and technological society, the University has produced thankfully, probably against its desires, it producesd a new crop of people, a group of activists whose current ] 10 demands on the university will hopefully be expanded to include assaults on the foundations of a society which has perverted education to reinforce inequity.
That task calls for something from young people, educated and trained, black and white, which has not always been forthcoming.
It calls for the realization that those in power seldom concede without a demand. It calls for the realization that education ought not be merely a funell where knowledge and students are poured in one end and come out educated at the other, but a process involving making a student, a seeker after ideas, into a man of action, a challenger of wrong and evil, a builder of right.
That process ought to involve teaching how one extricates one self from a period of prolonged and massive wrong doing.
That ought to be the curriculum at the University today.
And today's University ought to take as its credo a suggestion from Dr. DuBois, who wrote in 1909:
insert on page (4) following the sentence ending ""..are limited.""
the attached pages numbered 3, 4, and 5 through the paragra h ending ""...reinforce inequity.""
4
genius, not from men of whose minds and horizons are limited.
So then it is the entire fabric of education that is being attacked, its purposes, its ends. All black students have done is allowed their demands to be colored by their race.
Why should we not demand amnesty, the young ask, when you have allowed yourselves amnesty for over 300 years. Why should we negotiate, they has, when you have received it since you came to power. Why should we not use weapons, when you have used them time and time again against us. Why should we be accused of tearing down the university and having nothing to put in its place, when you have torn down Vietnam and left the ghetto standing? ] 7
Why should we not have a black house on campus, the blacks ask, when the Methodists, Episcopalians, Jews and Catholics often have theirs.
insert
Why should we not learn about ourselves, the blacks ask? Haven't we been made to learn more than we ever wanted to know about you?
Why shouldn't any and every black high school graduate [illegible] be admitted freely to this college, the blacks ask. Aren't they being taught by your graduates, and therefore shouldn't they have learned what it takes to fit in here?
Why should DOW Chemical or ROTC be on campus, the students ask? We are not here to learn to make napalm or to learn how to be soldiers. This is not a vocational school for any employer ] 12 they say, or at least it should not be.
This ought to be, the students say, a center for the shaping
5
of civilised man; a center for the study of not just why man behaves as he does, but also a center for the study of how to make him behave better.
insert on 4 [The following sentence is circled] Why shouldn't we take over a building and evict the deans; isn't every big city university, in conivance with urban renewal, doing the same thing to entire families on a permanent basis every day?
To do this, the university must rid itself of several old notions. First of all, higher education can no longer be regarded as a priledge for a few, but must be seen as a right for the many. All None of the rhetoric of the past several years about an education for everyone really approaches this aim; higher education is still an elitist and largely white preserve in America today.
In an age when education itself is being questioned, to permit or even to require that everyone receive a piece of parchment which will establish that he knows what hundreds millions of people already know with little profit to mankind will not suffice; it is simply not enough and simply will not do. ] 13
What is it then that is lacking? What is there beyond four years of compressing the all world's knowledge from lecture notes to the little blue book?
For the blacks, it must be more than Swahili lessons and Afro-American centers, although these have their place. For white univer-
6
sities, it must be more than raiding Southern black schools and taking their most talented faculty and students. For the black schools, it must be more than just pride in blackness.
It must be, for all of these, the development, not just of curriculum but of an ideology suited to extricate man from himself.
The university can become
A writer in the Center Magazine1 described the dilemma school's failing function. He wrote: ""Students are encouraged to relinquish their own wills, their freedom of volition; they are taught that ] 14 value and culture live out reside outside oneself, and must be acquired from the institutions, and almost everything in their education is designed to discourage them from activity, from the wedding of idea and act. It is almost as if we hoped to discourage them from thought itself, by making ideas so lifeless, so hopeless, that their despair would be enough to make them manipulable and obedient.""
While the university may have bred despair, it thankfully has not bred obedience. Violence occurs where there is no politics; while there is no politics of race, or rather while there is no anti-racist politics on the university, violence - physical and intellectual, will flourish.
When Until the university develops a politics - or in better terms, perhaps for this gathering, a curriculum and a discipline that stifles war and poverty and racism, then until then, the university ] 15 will be in doubt.
If education is a socializing process, in our society it has prepared white people to continue enjoying priviledged traditions and positions, while black people, through it, have been programmed
7
for social and economic oblivion.
Today's black and white students see this. They see the university nuturing war and directing counter-revolution; they see their professors employed in the pentagon; they see their presidents serving on commission after commission investigating and recommending last year's solutions to the last century 's problems; they see the university recruit ghetto students with substandard backgrounds and then submit these students to standards of white, middle class America. ] 16
They believe, as does the Tougaloo students I quoted from earlier, that ""the task is to create revolutionary institutes of learning ""the task for black students and black Americans is much greater than trying to change white institutions and their white counterparts in the South. The task is to create revolutionary institutes of learning. The act of trying to be a better person, of trying to imagine and create humane institutions is formidable, but we have no other alternative. We must have a prototype from which to build a good society. The point which I make is an old one - that revolution is not only the seizure of power, but is also the building of a society that is qualitatively better than the one we presently live in.""2
XXXXXXX

Today's university ought to take its credo from Dr. DuBois, who described the purpose of education thusly:
"".....we believe that the vocation of man in a modern, civilised land includes not only the technique of his actual work but intelligent comprehension of his elementary duties as a father, citizen, maker of public opinion,...a conservor of the public health, an intelligent follower of moral customs, and one who can appreciate if not partake something of the higher spiritual life of the world . We do not pretend that this can be taught to each individual in school, but it can be put into his social environment, and the more that environment is restricted and curtailed the more emphatic is the demand that .....The group (man) shall be trained and trained thoroughly in these matters of human development if they he are to share the surrounding civilisation.""
That is what the University ought to be. That is what is demanded to solve the problem of the 20th century. That is what the educated man ought to demand from his education, the creation of a body of educated persons in this world, not educated by virtue of act of legislature or confering of degree, but educated by virtue of service to their brothers, to the oppressed and downtrodden, to the wretched of this earth.
When that day comes, then will an education will have some meaning, then will the learned demand and receive respect, and then will the peoples of the world be able to answer the plea made by the silent Statue of Liberty who facing the East, has turned her back upon those very forces of the West who deny liberty in this age.
She asks: Give me your tired, your poor, your huddled masses
new ending
But perhaps what the university's response ought to be in sentiments like that one is best expressd in the words of the late ] 17 Dr. W. E. B. DuBois, words written almost 50 years ago.
Dr. Dubois said:
(include from ""We believe.......
(conclude with sentence ending ""...surrounding civilization.""

There are all sorts of poverty here. If someone thought George Wallace should have been President of the United States, or Robert Kennedy, or Dick Gregory, or even Hubert Humphrey, then that person is politically poor today.
If someone believes that the social and economic order ought to be turned toward producing wholesome lives for many, rather than impersonal profits for a few, then that person is poor today.
Whenever we speak today about those kinds of Americans
1A
who are cut out of politics, or who are cut out of today's warfare economy, we usually mean the poor most of us know about.
And when we speak of the poor, we are speaking of people who have several things in common.
The poor are usually non-white. The poor usually are members of families with no earners.
They usually belong to families whose head is female.
Their families usually have more than six children under eighteen years old.
The ""poor"" person would usually used to live in a rural, farm area. He will have less than an eigth grade education.
If all of the poor were lined up together, most of them would be white. But if they are considered as percentages of
2
larger groups, only ten percent of America's white population fits our definition of poverty, while more than [illegible] 40% of America's Black population fits that scale.
And although our definition describes ""poor"" people as those living in rural poverty, now over one quarter of all poor people live in ghettoes... white or Black... in our central cities, while only fifteen percent live in farm areas.
Now that we know who the poor are, we must discover why they are poor.
One writer tells that poor people are poor because of a combination of social and economic circumstances. He lists these as the poverty of the areas in which they live, their age, their lack of education or skills and finally, their race.
But for the Black poor, poverty exists simply and
3
solely because of race. Race has colored their lives. Race has so ordered their lives as if to preordain not just that twenty percent of Black America will be poor, but that the gap between Black and white in this country will grow larger and larger even as our economy grows.
Now in 1969, the American poor are slipping away from the ""invisibility"" that Michael Harrington told us they enjoyed.
The ""poor"" are slipping into public consciousness because they have finally begun to demand that they not be poor any longer. Their demands are expressed in the actions of welfare mothers taking over a welfare office; in the sit-in staged by deposed dispossed tenant farmers in Mississippi at an abandoned Air Force base; by the actions of their children in taking what
4
they see dangled before their eyes daily on television, and in the measured feet of millions marching even today from the mechanized rural ghettoes of the deep South to the vertical segregation of big city America.
The demands of the poor, the underclass, the dispossessed are finally and most emphatically shown in Watts, in Newark, in Detroit when poor people... and some not so poor... expressed with a match, a brick, a hidden rifle... their unbearable discontent with things as they are.
The actions of poor people... most emphatically the actions of the urban, youthful poor... have stirred a sleepy nation to limited action.
We began, in 1964, a war on poverty. Unlike the war against the Vietnamese people, this one was announced by...
5
and debated in... Congress. Again, unlike the war in Vietnam, this one had difficulty getting proper funding, but like the war in Vietnam, our Generals made bold predictions about this war ending soon, and like the war in Vietnam, it is obvious that the enemy is winning.
But the poor have won a small victory; they have stopped being invisible. They were always visible to themselves, and to a handful of other Americans who took the time to try to solve some of the problems of poverty.
So, by 1969, at least poor people have visually come into their own.
Senator Ernest Hollings of South Carolina admits they are there. He knew it all the time, he says, but he didn't want anyone else to know.
6
Senator Herman Talmadge, my own junior senator from Georgia, knows they are there. I think he knew it all the time, too.
And The Congress of the United States seems more and more to be aware that there are some people who, in 1969, have nine-inch tapeworms, who suffer from diseases that no one except Biafrans are supposed to have, and that there are Americans who are slowly starving to death.
But as today's poor... particularly the Black poor... become more and more visible, they discover that poverty is poorer today than yesterday. That is, it takes more money to be poor now than it used to.
Yesterday's poor man had a strong back and could sell his labor, often cheaply, to a ready market.
7
Today's poor man finds no market ready or willing to buy his labor. And in today's market, he discovers that a strong back is not enough. Yesterday's bricklayers could lay brick without speaking English; today's bricklayer must speak English, know math, and in some cases, must be white as well in order to get a job.
For some of the new poor, the transition from farm to city is easily reversed. Thus the poor white and the poor Indian may shuffle back and forth from city to country, retreating when the going gets rough and returning when times are better.
But the poor Black man has escaped one great enemy by coming north to Chicago or Detroit: the vicious repression that filled his life with fear and his nights with phantoms back on the farm.
For him, there is no return.
8
And so he stays there, getting poorer and poorer.
And the rest of us, those who in 1969 are just beginning... for one reason or another... to realise that he exists, what do we do?
If we are President of the United States, we propose eliminating programs that have made a small, very small, dent in poverty. And then whe proposes an economic system which has not solved problems of poverty for white people, and we try to be hip by calling it ""Black"" capitalism.
What Black people need less of is the kind of capitalism that produced the plantation, the kind of capitalism that keeps Black wages at the bottom of the wage scale, the kind of capitalism that subsidizes the rich at the expense of the poor.
9
What we need more properly is community socialsiism, community control of economic development, so that our economy can produce jobs and income for the many instead of profits for the few.
And if we are Assistant Secretary of Defense, we fight Black unemployment by giving fourteen million dollars worth of defense contracts to three Southern textile firms on the premise they will do better in hiring Black people in the future.
And, if you are Secretary of Health, Education and Welfare, you tell five Southern School Districts that have had nearly fifteen years to obey the law that they can have sixty additional days. Is that not like wh like telling a robber you have caught in the act he has sixty days in which to explain why he was robbing you? And isn't it robbery to steal a decent education from Black
10
children?
There is a direct, causal relationship between that Black poverty in our cities and white repression in the South.
There is a direct relationship between the billions spent on war abroad and the pennies spent here. There is a direct relationship between Watts and Newark and Detroit and the countless other uprisings.
America's Black poor people, in 1969, constitute a colony. They are a nation... a dark, poor, surrounded nation... within the larger white nation.
They are as much a colony in 1969 as America was in 1775. The mother country... England in one instance, white America in this instance... steals from the colony, and gives nothing in return.
Our diminishing labor is stolen, with little or
11
nothing in return. Our pitiful education is tolaken, with nothing in return. Our taxes... and the poor pay far more taxes than anyone else... are taken and nothing is given in return.
That kind of situation constitutes a colony. The first American colony, through armed rebellion, insurrection, destruction, death and civil disorder... escaped from its colonial status.
This new colony does not have that avenue at its disposal. It cannot retreat into a virgin West, it finds itself surrounded by superior hardware on all four sides, and it finds itself disorganized, disunited and disenheartened.
What this group needs, among other things, is the kind of political efforts and physical efforts and economic efforts that will help it band together, to join with other disadvantaged groups, to seek out new... and shifting alliances... for the hard
12
years ahead.
Some of the direction for these new efforts might come from American college campuses, but it does not. Today's students have taken up one worthwhile effort... the restructuring of the American university... and have laid down another, the kind of grass roots organizing that must be done if the poor... Black and white and Spanish-surnamed... are to become a viable force.
Now the bright young men and women who find themselves in America's colleges and universities could become a potent force again. They were in 1960 when they integrated lunch counters. They were in 1961 when they integrated interstate travel. They were in 1964 when they won in Mississippi fields and lonely dark rural roads the right for Black people to vote.
And they could be again. They could be if they weigh
13
the value of an Afro American Institute at college X, Y or Z or the presence of recruiters from the C. I. A. at college A, B, or C against the demands of welfare mothers who want clothes for their children, or Southern Black farmers who want a crop loan, or Black people in the streets of the cities who want a decent place to live.
They will first have to find ways and means to direct their energies, not toward integration or education, but toward organization.
For those white students who want something to do: I know a white couple, living in New Orleans on a subsistence salary, who have organized a workingman's coalition of Ku Klux Klan-ers and Black factory hands in a Mississippi town. Which of you will leave school to help them?
14
For those Black students who want something to do, I know of four hundred Black politicians who want aides; some of these men cannot read well or write well, or understand the law. Which of you will travel South to help them help themselves?
They will have to find ways to apply classroom knowledge to a street situation, and to apply book learning to block problems.
And they will have to find ways to build independent pockets of Black power, and Spanish power, and poor white power, and will have to find ways to pull that power together with whatever decency and honesty can be found elsewhere in America.
If that job is not done, then only sadder, poorer days can result. And one might begin to believe that a future like that envisioned by W. S. Scarborough, a teacher at Wilberforce Doing that job means committment.

University in 1891. Scarborough wrote:
""The Negro has been patient... yes, more than that. He has prostrated himself at the feet of Government, and has remonstrated with it for his rights. The Government has failed to do its duty… the end is not yet. The struggle has just begun. The Blacks themselves intend to have something to say as to what shall be done with them. They intend to have a hand in the settlement of the questions, and until they do, the questions will never be settled.…. The so-called Negro question can be settled if the whites permit it. Our American white citizens may defer a solution by all sorts of schemes and devices, but the time will come when they, North and South will have to confront the inevitable, and grant the

We must provide for our people. We must guarantee their incomes, provide them with jobs, enrich their education, feed their hunger.
We must do this, or do nothing.
And if we do nothing... and the we is everyone... then Mr. Scarborough's prediction will come true, we will suffer the consequences.
And the consequences of neglect are destruction.

Let me tell you about my constituents.
It is difficult to know what to say to an audience like this one. We come from so many different backgrounds, we hold so many different jobs, we have so many different ambitions. All that we have in common is the fact that we are politicians, we are black, and we are very largely elected by black constituencies. 
These [illegible] and the race of the people whom we represent, the people who have chosen us to make important decisions for them. 
Without knowing [illegible] kinds of people have elected you, let me tell you something about the people I am proud to represent in the Georgia general assembly -- the citizens of the 111th [illegible] district of Fulton County. 
They are almost all black--nearly 85% of them. They are nearly all poor--their average yearly income per family is $2500. They have trouble finding work--unemployment in my district runs between 30 and 40%. They are poorly educated--on the average they completed only the sixth grade.
Most of the men have trouble finding work, and so the labor force in my district is predominantly female. You all know the kind of work poorly educated black women do--day work, domestic service, cleaning someone else's kitchen, caring for someone else's children.
Incidentally, the white citizens of my district share the same condition, but unfortunately for them, most of them think that somehow the color of their skin makes their small amount of money go further, or that their whiteness makes their poor sixth grade education better than the one my black constituents have.
But the point of all these statistics is simply to demonstrate that my constituents are probably very much like you other blacks--they are poor and black, and they depend on government, very largely--their city and county and state governments and their
2
federal governments--to help them do the things they are unable to do themselves.
That is why they have chosen me a black man to represent them, because tehy still retain some faith in the power of the democratic process to solve people's problems.
I am very much afraid that for the next several years, they are in for some dissapointments.
If your [illegible] They are like most other black Americans--they voted very heavily for Vice-President Humphrey. They wanted him to be President. They may have had some other first choice, but that was denied them by an assasin in Los Angeles. They may have even, like I did, have had a second choice, but that was denied them by democracy in Chicago.
So therefore they voted for Mr. Humphrey. He represented warmth, while one can only find coldness in the icyness we now hear described as the ""new"" Nixon.
So while we they were voting one way, the rest of the country voted another. They chose a man who said he didn't expect to get black votes, and therefore never sought them out; they chose a man who said he was publically for open housing but privately against it; and they chose a man who says the federal government is enforcing the 1954 Supreme Court Decision too swiftly.
They chose a man who has tremendous power to set either a positive or a negative future for black Americans.
--he perhaps may choose five new Supreme Court justices, and therefore may determine the nature of the decisions that court makes in civil rights cases over the rest of this century.
--he will certainly choose has chosen a new attorney general and a new head of the civil rights division of the Department of Justice, and will decide how vigorously--or whether at all--they enforce the legislation that affects us most vitally.
--he is going to name naming the staff and set setting the budget for the Department of Health, Education and Welfare, the Department of Housing and Urban Development, and the Office of Economic Opportunity.
3
He will detremine how these agencies respond when they are asked to deal with our problems.
He will have a great deal to say about the nature of the 92nd Congress.
Now those are not the kinds of decisions one wants to leave to a man whose closest advisers include Strom Thurmond.
But we are faced now that the election has passed with being ruled by a man who was not the choice of 90% of us, with being ruled by a man who has yet to demonstrate that he has any concern for the poor or the black. We will be ruled by a man who says he wants to rebuild our slums with black capitalism, whice can only mean exchanging the race of the people who have been exploiting us.
Faced with that kind of government over the next four years, the way that all of us act from now until 1972 is going to be very important.
We face these next four years, we face a Congress that is more conservative than the last one, we face a nation that has grown tired of the demands of the black and the poor, in a position worse off, relatively speaking, than our position has been over the past several years.
You all know the statistics that show more black people working, more living in decent homes, more getting an education, more earning more money.
There is another set of figures that shows we make less money now. More in comparison with what we used to make, but less in comparison with white people. We are moving out of poverty, but while white poverty in America has decreased 27%, black poverty has decreased only 3%.
The most frightening figure is this one. The infant mortality rate for blacks--compared with whites--in 1940, 28 years ago, was 70%. higher. In other words, our babies died 70% faster, 28 years ago than white babies did. There has been some change however--in 1962, just six short years ago, the figure was 90%.
Now in addition to those kinds of problems, we face involvement in a problem of national proportions, a problem that affects every American, black and white. That
4
problem is America's imperial war in Vietnam. The difference, black and white, is that it affects us more.
It feeds on our community. It takes our sons and fathers and brothers and uncles to fight and die in it in gr ater proportion than it takes any other group of Americans. Is that because we are braver, or because we love fighting more than anyone else, or because we are gr ater patriots. I think not. I think it is because young black men find the Army uniform and three square meals a day more attractive than they find life in Harlem, or Watts, or the Delta of Mississippi or the bayous of Louisiana.
And so the war takes them. It sends them 8,000 miles away from their homes, telling them they are defending freedom, the kind of freedom they often find lacking in the communities they leave behind.
The war places many of them in an integrated situation for the first time--a front-line foxhole, next to some white boy. tAmerica has not yet discovered how to get that kind of integration at home.
Most of us are spectators to the war. We watch the young black man and the white boy on television, often in living color, as they burn down the huts of some poor Vietnamese village, and realize the two of them could not live on the same block in most American villages. We make realize further that if the young black boy is lucky enough to survive the war without being killed, he may come home, and my become so frustrated at the discrimination and racism he meets in the land of his birth that he may burn down some American village, using, of course, the skills and the techniques he learned while defending America's freedom overseas.
Now I have heard some black [politicians] people say that the war didn't affect them, that it was a foreign policy matter, and that we ought not to say anything about it, that it wasn't our business.
Well let me say that anytime you live in a country that is willing to pay $500,000 for every enemy soldier it kills, and only $50.75 for every poor person in
5
the war on poverty, then that is your business.
Everytime you find yourself living in a country that tells you violence is all right when it results in death and destruction for some little brown people 8,000 miles away but not when it is done by black people here at home, then it is your business.
Everytime your government tells you that the trouble in Vietnam is caused by outside agitators from the North, think back to George Wallace and Marvin Griffin telling you that you Southern blacks would be happy and satisfied if it wasn't for the outside agitators from the American North.
Ladies and gentlemen, it is everyone's business.
So we have to make it our business to tackle some of the evils of 20th Century Americanism--racism and militarism.
We could begin to do that by making our own communities strong, and by controlling the good and services and the institutions of our communities. For a long time we've only had the church. That was the only think that was ours, and our alone. But I hope in the future that we've begin to widen our sights, and say to ourse;ves that if it operates in a community of black people, black people have got to control it.
That means the businesses and it means the schools and it may mean the police as well.
I was in New York City on Monday and I went to Intermediate School #201. That one of the Harlem schools that is controlled and run by the people of Harlem. I spoke to a class of eighth graders, and in my speech, I mentioned some great people who have come from Georgia, and with Roy Hamilton and Ray Charles and James Brown and Otis Redding and Gladys Knight and the Pips I mentioned the Honorable Elijah Muhammad. Now you may not think that eighth graders ought to be taught about Ray Charles or James Brown, and I'd agree with you, and you might think that Elijah Muhammad might not be a proper subject for an eight grade class either, but they knew who he was. One eighth grader told me--""Elijah Muhammad taught racist dictrines and that's why Malcolm X left the Muslims."" Another told me that ""The Honorable Elijah Muhammad is the leader of the Nation of Islam and the Messenger
6
of Allah.""
Now I submit to you that's a wonderful thing. Not that one child agrees with Mr. Muhhamad and another does not, but that both know about him, and both know he is a part of our peculiar history in the United States.
That I think is what it means when black peopIe control their community.
Additionally, I think we've got to be aware of and suspicious of attempts to turn us against our own interests. Take Mr. Nixon's black capitalism, for instance. Now before any one you begin to think I'm against capitalism, let me correct you. But I think we'd all admit that if it had not been for white capitalism none of us would every have been sold into slavery.
As Mr. Nixon explains it, black capitalism means that General Motors will be given tax credits to come into my community to set up a factory that will hire and train black people. Now that is wonderful, but its not black capitalism by any stretch of the imagination. That is white capitalism once again coming into the black community and taking the only thing we have to offer, which in our labor.
Instead, we ought to become interested in-- now here's a terrible, dirty word -- community socialism. We ought to be interested in the kind of economic development in our communities that will not only give us jobs, but will give the community the profit as well.
A minister in Philadelphia, the Rev. Leon Sullivan, the man who began the idea that became Operation Breadbasket, has a project like that working now. Mr. Nixon has seen it, and we ought to hope that he gets the message.
We are additionally going to have to look around us for the kinds of people we can join forces with. It would be nice if we could go it alone. I am sure there is not a single person here black American who hasn't said to himself, at one time or another, I wish I could just get away from all this. But we can't, and our numbers are so small nationally that we have got to find the kinds of people who can help us. Those we used to bepend on us have deserted us. Organized labor used to call itself our friend, but you saw where labor was in the 1968 Presidential election.
7
White liberals and moderates used to help us, but this terrible war has attracted nearly all their attention.
So we have got to try to find new friends, while we hope the old ones will come home. We naturally ought to look to the other colored minorities. The Mexican-Americans and the Peurto Ricans and the American Indians.
If we could get some kind, any kind of response from the heavy sheild of racism that blinds poor white people, they would be our natural allies too.
In the future, we will have to beware of the kinds of coalitions like the one that has existed in this city for so long. That coalition put all of us together with some of the white people -- the moderates and the liberals. It worked out fine while it was intended to maintain order, but when the blacks began to demand justice, the coalition is beginning to show some signs of wear, and now they want to expand the city limits to cut our numbers down.
So we have to always be on the lookout for any other forces in American political society that can help us. We ought not to turn anyone down down. If your house is on fire, and a man runs up with a bucket of water, don't ask him where he got it or who he is, just make sure its not gasoline and then pur it on.
Finally, although we need fast action, we have to move with care. We are living in strange times. For the first time in the last eight years, the forces of conservatism have won a national election. For the first time since 1948, we have had a presidential candidate who appeales to racism. This year the hill-billy Hitler from Alabama won 9 million votes. In 1972 he will be back again, and we must be ready for him. We live in an era in white the next Vice-President of the United States makes jokes about Polacks and Japs--you know that any man who does that will also joke about Wops and Spics and Niggers too. We live in an era in which [illegible] a committee of the United States House of Representatives has said we ought to reopen the concentration camps that the Japanese were put in during the Second World War, but this time they don't want to put the Japanese in them, they intend them for us.
[Handwritten and circled on verso of page 7:] 5:30

In an era like that, we ought to consider that an attack on one of us is really an attack on all of us.
We ought to remember what a German minister had to say when someone asked him what he did to stop Hitler from coming to power.
He said: ""When they came for the Jews, I did not cry out because I was not a Jew. When they came for the Catholics, I did not cry out because I was not a Catholic. When they came for the union leaders, I did not cry out, because I was not a union leader. But when they knocked on my door, then and only then did I think of screaming, but there was no one around to hear my screams.""
In closing, let me say one final thing. I have believed that we are and will be a great people because we come from a great people. We have great heroes. But a people with alimited view of their own past will have a limited future. So let me close by reading to you three one short pieces that comes from our past. One It comes from a man who was I believe, our greatest hero, Frederick Douglas. His words of 100 years ago ought still apply to us today. The next comes from a black minister who had a church in Selma, Alabama - 100 years ago, and another comes from a man like us, a black politician, who was thrown out of the Georgia House of Representatives 100 years ago.
Frederick Doulass:
""He who would be free must strike the first blow. You know that liberty given is nevr so precious as liberty sought for and fought for. The man who is outraged is the man who must make the first outcry. Depend on it, men will not care much for a people who do not care for themselves. Men will organize to prevent cruelty to animals, for they are dumb cr atures, and cannot speak for themselves, but we are men, and men must speak for themselves or we shall not be spoken for at all. We hold it self evident that no class or color should be the exclusive rulers of this country. If there is such a ruling class, there must of course be a subject class, and when that condition is established, the government of the people, by the people and for the people will perish from the earth."

DuBois correctly stated that the problem of the 20th Century would be the problem of the color line.
In those few words he summed up the crisis that has occupied men and nations, and that has become the first order of business for millions of oppressed peoples.
The roots of the crisis are as old as the world itself; the roots involve the continuing failure of the minority of peoples in this world to share wealth and power with the majority of the world's population.
It is a struggle that has broken out on every college campus; it has been taken to the streets of most cities in the country, both violently and non-violently.
It is part of the struggle that inspires Cuban cane-cutters to overthrow dictators, a part of the struggle that inspires Vietnamese peasants to resist, successfully it seems, 20 years of attempts to dominate their homeland; it is a part of the struggle that inspires Alabama sharecroppers to risk life and limb in order to have a chance at controlling their destiny.
Dr. DuBois believed that scientific and rational study of the problems of race and class would yield rational and logical solutions; civilized man, or educated man, is supposed to solve his problems in a civilized manner, we have all believed.
But the problems of the 20th Century are so vast that many have quite properly been urged to seek uncivilized solutions to them.
-2-
These problems include the poisoning of air and water; the rape of land; the new colonialization of peoples, both here and abroad; the new imperialism practiced by Western democracy, and the continuing struggle of those who have not against those who have.
With the birth of the colossus called the United States, rational and educated men began to believe that civilization, stretched to its highest order, had begun. Building on a heritage of revolution, expressing a belief in the equality of most, if not all men, this new democracy was to be the highest elevation of men's relationships one to the other, and a new beginning of decency between nations.
Civilization, as it was then defined, included imposing limitations on war between nations, encouraging the spread of industrialization, the civilizing of so-called heathen elements, the harnessing of nature for the benefit and pleasure of man. It was believed generally that man's better nature would triumph over his base desire to conquer and rule and make war, and that intellect, reason and logic would share equally with morality in deciding man's fate.
Of course it has not been so. Many still make war, he still insists that one group subordinate its wishes and desires to that of another, he still insists on gathering material wealth at the expense of his fellows and his environment.
Men and nations have grown arrogant, and the classic struggle of the 20th Century continues.
The educated peoples of this world have enslaved the uneducated; the rich have dominated the poor; the white minorities have crushed the non-white peoples of the globe.
Revolutionary nations -- revolutionary 300 years ago -- have
-3-
turned to counter-revolution.
This country, which has visited death on thousands of Vietnamese, has found the arrogance to ignore the centuries of pleading from her own domestic colony, the blacks.
When these pleadings are dismissed, then the problem of the 20th Century comes to the fore, and violence is done to the notion that men can solve their problems without it.
We need to discover who is, and who isn't, violent in America.
Violence is black children going to school for 12 years and receiving 5 years of education.
Violence is 30 million hungry stomachs in the most affluent nation on earth.
Violence is having black people represent a disproportionate share of inductees and casualties in Vietnam.
Violence is a country where property counts more than people.
Violence is an economy that believes in socialism for the rich and capitalism for the poor.
Violence is spending $900 per second to stifle the Vietnamese, but only $77 a year to feed the hungry people at home.
Violence is spending $78 billion to kill and only $12 billion to make whole.
Violence is J. Edgar Hoover listening to your telephone conversations; violence is an Assistant Attorney General proposing concentration camps for white and black militants.
Violence is 6,000 American farmers receiving $25,000 not to work.
Violence is the Congress of the United States putting cotton,
-4-
tobacco, rice and cattle ahead of people.
Violence is Richard Nixon and Spiral Agnew ignoring the expression of peace of millions of Americans.
But an antidote to that violence exists; the antidote was begun with Denmark Vesey and Nat Turner, was given impetus by DuBois and the Niagara Movement; was spurred by Martin Luther King, Jr. and thousands of nameless fighters for freedom.
But movements are not built on the helpful motions of a few, but by the determined actions of the many.
The chance at power comes in this country not from seizing a dean, but from seizing a welfare office; from organizing a strike of domestic workers; from beginning the process of transferring strength and power from those who have to those who do not.
This is not easy work. It is not easy because no one wants to do it. In an era of doing your own thing, no one wants to do for and with those whose thing has become winning and retaining the right to live.
It will require more than just the commitment of summer soldiers, although any soldiers are welcomed into an understaffed army.
It will require serious and systematic allocations of time and energy and resources.
It will require that rhetoric be turned into actions, that schoolbook knowledge be turned toward street situations, that theories be turned into practice.
It will require that politics means people and their problems, and not just elections and candidates.
It will require that we build a movement strong enough to
-5-
take over in a peaceful and orderly fashion; or to take control, following the example of those who now exercise control.
That suggests there will be no peace. The oppressed of this land will not let peace prevail, until they are given power or until they are destroyed by it.
When the day of judgment comes, we shall each have to add up our marks. Those who sat idly by and did nothing until that day shall be the first to go.
But it will eventually consume us all. As the old spiritual says, ""God gave Noah the rainbow sign, no more water, the fire next time.""
In our terms, it means the kind of commitment from young people that would have kept the South in ferment from the heady days of 1964 until the present; it is the kind of commitment that takes over the dean's office one day, but the welfare office the next; the kind of commitment that will mean year-round participation in a new politics, a people's politics, a politics that will insure a choice, and not an echo, at the top of the ballot in November 1972.
And it will require that each of us keep in mind a prophecy written by the late Langston Hughes -- that dreams deferred do explode. For if this dream is deferred much longer, then an explosion will come.
The late -- and great -- Dr. W.E.B. BuBois' belief that the problem of the 20th Century would be the problem of the color line was later restated to include the problem of those who have not pitted against those who have.
Dr. DuBois wrote, 65 years ago, a personal credo which, if adopted by those in power, would begin to eliminate the problem of the
-6-
20th Century:
""I believe in God who made of one blood all races that dwell on earth. I believe that all men, black and brown and white, are brothers, varying, through Time and Opportunity, in form and gift and feature, but differing in no essential particular, and alike in soul and in the possibility of infinite development.
""Especially do I believe in the Negro Race; in the beauty of its genius, the sweetness of its soul, and its strength in that meekness which shall inherit this turbulent earth...
""I believe in the Prince of Peace. I believe that War is Murder. I believe that armies and navies are at bottom the tinsel and braggadocio of oppression and wrong; and I believe that the wicked conquest of weaker and darker nations by nations white and stronger but foreshadows the death of that strength.
""I believe in Liberty for all men; the space to stretch their arms and their souls; the right to breathe and the right to vote, the freedom to choose their friends, enjoy the sunshine...uncursed by color; thinking, dreaming, working as they will in a Kingdom of God and love...""

Subject: Rough draft of speech for 1970 National Health Forum
The Nature of the Crisis in Health Care Services in our Communities: as the Consumer Views the Problems
by Julian Bond
It is fashionable these days to declare that this country has a health care crisis on its hands. President Nixon says so; Secretary Finch says so. The Urban Coalition and Fortune magazine say so. But, most of all, the people -- the consumers of health care -- most of all, the people say so. Here are some of the things they are saying:

We want to be healthy. We know that modern medicine can keep us healthy, and we will suffer inconvenience beyond the point of sacrifice to get the highest quality available for ourselves and our families.
We know that it is expensive to run the modern paraphernalia of the health enterprise, but we don't see anything we as individuals can do about it. When life itself may be at stake, we allow ourselves to be victimized by exhorbitant prices because there is no other choice. Sometimes we don't take advantage of free or inexpensive services, because it is so inconvenient and costly in other ways.
We want to be treated with dignity and consideration. It is bad enough to go through all kinds of inconveniences to get to the source of health services, but it is intolerable to be treated like a piece of furniture when you get there.
2

We hope something can be done to improve the situation, but we know that some in the power structure of the health establishment seem to be very resistant to change. We are not sure what we as individuals can do to help, but we recognize and, one way or another, will assert our right to be healthy.

These are some of the things the people are saying. They say it a little differently in a remote rural area than they do in a big city -- and the poor say it differently than the white-collar middle class -- but the message is the same, and it comes through loud and clear: we have the right to be healthy.
Let me tell you a little more about what the people are saying, drawing on my experience as a member of the Citizens Board of Inquiry into Health Services for Americans. We are taking took some good hard looks at what consumers want, and one way we are going went about this is to visit the grass roots of this country, all kinds of grass roots, and we are listening to what people, all kinds of people, have to say about health. Now, our work is far from finished, but we have some preliminary impressions from our field trips to date and these I want to share with you today. I am going to be very fashionable and talk about our findings in terms of gaps--the health care gaps of the 1970s. I call these the quality gap, the cost gap, the sensitivity gap, and the complacency gap.
3
THE QUALITY GAP
People are not apathetic about health. They want medical care -- even the poor and ignorant will sacrifice almost any resources (including proper nutrition food) to receive it. And people want the best -- even the poor and ignorant suspect that five minutes with a physician and a prescription are not necessarily the best, whether this occurs in a rural general practitioner's office without even a physical examination or in a large urban clinic after a whole series of mysterious unexplained tests.
One woman we talked to told about going to seven different physicians before getting satisfaction -- this search for quality isn't easy when you're living in poverty in a shack in rural Arkansas: no phone, no car, and the nearest doctor nine miles away. ""None of them even examined me,"" she said, ""but they charge me $5. They just ask me what's wrong and I tell them."" One of these six doctors gave her a shot; that was $3 more; all of them gave her a prescription. ""All this time I was paying all this money for pills and doctors and feeling worse and worse; I swear some of those pills make me sicker."" Finally she went to a doctor located 37 miles away -- he was the only one who preceded the inevitable prescription with a physical examination.
One is tempted to wonder if the medical attention this woman finally received was really of very high quality, but it was the best available, and she went to a good deal of trouble and expense to find it. This ailment, I gather, was relatively minor -- the stories some of her neighbors told us were real horrors. The one performing heavy farm labor to pay for the diagnosis of heart trouble and who had never
4
had a chest x-ray or EKG. The one who couldn't afford to eat even as well as before the medical expenses-- the prescribed treatment was a nutritious diet. The one who had to keep the children home from school because medical debts meant no money for shoes.
People consider medical care a necessity, not a luxury -- dental care is more in the luxury class. And even poor-quality medical attention is better than none, but people will seek and sacrifice for the best available. People also know that it is within the capability of a nation that can fly men to the moon to make the very best even better, and they know that what the health sciences continue to learn through research is translated very slowly indeed into terms of adequate health services available to all. This makes people very critical of what currently prevails; they gripe about [money] expense, inconvenience, depersonalization, and complacency, but their most heartfelt gripes [illegible] are heard when there is a failure of quality expectations. The people we talked to on our field trips find it hard to forgive the casually dismissed head injury that turned out to be a fractured skull or the hepatitis that was diagnosed as ""just flu.""
Ignorant many of our people still may be -- even though the right to an education was declared so much earlier than the right to health services -- but stupid they are not. They want the best.
5
THE COST GAP
What consumers pay for health too often bears no relation to the quality of services they receive or to the cost incurred by the provider in rendering the service. People realize this, but they are not going to hunt bargains when they are seriously ill. Even though they are already eligible under prepaid plans, they will go elsewhere to seek what they perceive to be the best if they can possibly afford it. On our field trip to a large city, one man told us, ""I won't come back here. Next time I'll go somewhere else even if I have to pay for it.""
This consumer attitude means that some people in our society are truly victimized -- those who can least afford it often pay more and receive less than others in terms of medical care, and often they know it. The Citizens Board of Inquiry saw and heard a lot of this on our field trip to [illegible] the rural South, particularly with respect to drug pricing. We did a little survey comparing the prices charged for three different prescriptions at the drug stores in the local community with those charged at two chain drugstores in Washington, D.C. -- one in a middle-class white neighborhood and one in a low-income black neighborhood. One prescription was $12.00 in the local community and less than half as much, only $4.75 in the low-income black neighborhood in Washington. Another was $6.50 local, $2.60 middle-class white, and $3.29 low-income black. The third was $5.75 local, $1.90 middle-class white, and $1.99 low-income black. There must be some awfully rich pharmacists in that small community.
We hear a lot about the rising costs of health and medical care, and vast quantities of data are available. I wonder, incidentally, how
6
dependable some of these cost figures are as a basis for decision-making in health planning. I've become quite suspicious of any statistics in the health field after seeing the way some of them get in, or don't get in, the supposedly official record. But, assuming the cost data are o.k., I wonder if maybe we are just confusing ourselves in trying to interpret all those dollar signs in traditional economic terms.
There isn't going to be any change for the better unless some of the fixed notions of both consumers and providers are recognized. For example, some of the physicians our Citizens Board talked with stated their firm conviction that the personal dignity of the patient is demeaned by charity. Carried to extreme, and believe me it is, this attitude means that some people are actually denied access to the health care system without cash on the line. We encountered numerous examples of this on our field trips -- patients with not quite enough cash or patients on bad-debt lists were actually turned away, except in dire emergency. We even spotted two examples where women in labor were refused attention, one at a physician's office and one at a hospital. It is hard to believe, but that's what we were told.
The people are dissatisfied with our present means of [meeting] covering the costs of health services. I hope some of our providers are also; otherwise there is little hope for improving the efficiency of the system, no matter how much public money becomes available to guarantee that health care is a right of every citizen, not a privilege.
7
THE SENSITIVITY GAP
People talk most volubly about their distress with the insensitivity displayed by the providers of care -- personal needs, personal dignity, and personal convenience are too often ignored. Let us not confuse this with the people's concern about quality of care--they will suffer indignity in silence, accepting it as part of the ""cost"" of ""good"" care. Some patients we talked to on our field trips accept it under protest -- in fact they tell us you have to scream a lot or no one will pay any attention, and you have to scream to a lot of different people demanding the service your need.
What seems to bug people the most? It ranges from little things like the possibly unintentional rudeness of a busy and harrassed receiptionist, and the busy signal (or impersonal ""please hold"" recording) when you call for an appointment, to vicious and hurtful insult. One woman told us that she was admitted to a hospital to have her baby, even though she did not have cash in hand -- the scowling physician greeted her with the comment: ""All right, you made your egg. Go ahead and lay it.""
This insensitivity shows up everywhere, even in the supposedly enlightened university medical centers. We had heard some patient complaints about the physical accessibility of one clinic; when we [illegible] asked those in authority why its locale could not be changed, we were told that would be impossible because it would be inconvenient for the medical students. I can't judge whose convenience was most important in that
8
case, but there has to be some compromise between the convenience of the providers and the convenience of the consumers. It is interesting that the field trips of the Citizens Board turned up no evidence that a patient perceived the problems of, say, the physician -- except perhaps to comment that ""he's awfully busy."" Sometimes it seems the present system was designed for the inconvenience of all the people concerned -- maybe some of the new computers are happy; we didn't ask them.
We noted that consumers tend to blame the insensitivity, the depersonalization of service, on the business motives of the health providers -- be it the simple profit motive of an individual physician or a proprietary hospital or the more complex efficiency motive of a huge group health plan enterprise. Whatever the cause, people seem to be more concerned with the insensitive attitudes of the people in authority than with the actual facts of the inconvenience. One of the few positive areas of comment in our depressing collection of consumer dissatisfaction turned up when an unhappy experience in one place was compared with a happier experience in another -- [adequate] the transportation service of one plan is sheer joy to someone who has coped with inadequate parking; one mother who had had a sick child in several institutions was indelibly impressed when a nurse asked her if the child had any special food preferences.

A great many of the people who speak to college campuses begin their speeches by telling stale jokes which the audiences heard many many times before. I am no different. So I want to tell you one or two things that are not intended to be humorous. But it may have something to do with the tone of the whole evening which is discussing young people, particularly young people in politics. So I want to tell you one or two things of a political nature, one or two bits of information I've picked up in my travels about the U. S. of A. (sic) Things that may not be known to all of you which may or may not be interesting to you.
First, thing I'd like to share with you is a bit of information I picked up some days ago in New York City while reading the New York Times. I saw an announcement in the Times of the publication of the world's smallest book. Thought it particularly interesting and wondered why it hadn't drawn more comment. It's a book published by a company called Hawthorne Press and is available for a dollar fifty in paperback, and I knew it as the smallest book ever published because the title is, The Life and Convictions of Spiro T. Agnew. I'd like also to bring a musical note. This is a song I've heard sung at a concert in New York City a month or so ago. A song written by a fairly well known folk singer, Mr. Tom Paxtall. I'm not going to sing it. I'll read it. It says, ""Let me sing you the ballad of Spiro Agnew, Let me tell you the wonderful things he has done . . . . .
Let me tell you one other thing that has to do with a television show that's about to be premiered. It's one that would be of interest, I think, to those of you who like to watch T.V. It's going to be a new show like all the other television shows: a lot of bloodshed, drama, violence, lots of excitement, almost no sex, however. It's going to be based on the Democratic
2
National Convention and it would be on T.V. now except that the producers have not decided what it ought to be called. Some think it ought to be called, ""Beat the Press."" Others think it ought to be called, ""Mace the Nation.""
This is an unusual format you gave me; usually it is just me speaking and answering questions. And After having done that for a great many times over the past several weeks I have discovered that lots of schools ask me to speak for a much longer time than I am prepared to speak. You have asked me to speak for a much shorter time than I am preprared to speak. But because, because (sic) I'm interested in other things besides what I'm going to talk about, I'd like to take just a minute to speak, to give you something, to tell you about something that you might not ordinarily know about. It has again, a little something to do with what I am going to speak to you about. And I want to get at it in a sort of round about way. It has to do with something I have noticed on a lot of college campuses all over the country and most of the places where I've travelled. And it's something I call the ""Snow White Syndrome."" Now if you saw the movie ""Snow White"" you may remember the scene in which Snow White stands by the well, drawing water. She sings, ""Some Day My Prince Will Come,"" and, as luck would have it, he did come.
Now I have detected on a great many college campuses in this country the ""Snow White Syndrome"" and that a lot of young people are saying to themselves, ""Robert Kennedy is dead!"" Eugene McCarthy did not receive the nomination of the Democratic Party and so, therefore I will wait until my prince will come. Now that kind of dependence on princes may be all right in fairy tales; it's not very good practice for real life. So I just want to give you a warning that people ought not depend upon princes on white horses to even come along and direct them, or even to come along and lead them to the land of happiness and golden streets.
3
And I want to read one or two things, one of which comes from a man who, if he were living, would be the man who would be my prince, but he has been dead for a great many years and therefore I know he is not coming. Before I begin to read it, let me tell you something about this man. I say, this man was a hero of mine. About a hundred years ago, he was a very famous man of his day; was the equivalent of his day of Martin Luther King (sic) and Stokeley Carmichael wrapped together; received tremendous amounts of respect and admiration from a great many people, and was probably the most prominent black man of his day.
Now to give you an idea why you must not depend on people to save you, let me tell you something about this man. There is, not far from here, a couple of hundred miles, a little town called Chambersburg, Pennsylvania. And Chambersburg, Pennsylvania was a scene of a visit by this man. This man's name was Frederick Douglas and he came Chambersburg, Pennsylvania, to meet with another famous man called John Brown. You remember John Brown, don't you--you know the song that goes, ""John Brown's body lies a molderin (sic) in the grave . . ."" John Brown was just getting ready to attack the arsenal at Harper's Ferry. And he called this hero of mine, Frederick Douglas to come down to Chambersburg to discuss it.
Douglas was an old man. He was accompanied by a servant named Shiels Greene. And where Frederick Douglas was intelligent, well-educated, although self-educated, and was knowledgable about a great many things, Shiels Greene was directly the opposite. He was uneducated, unsophisticated, and he was not knowledgable about a great many things. But the two of them traveled together to Chambersburg; they heard John Brown say he intended to attack the arsenal at Harper's Ferry, overthrow the government of the southern states. And he heard John Brown urge Frederick Douglas to come with him. He said, ""Fred, when
4
I strike, the bees will begin to swarm, and I shall want you to hive them."" Frederick Douglas, there--forced to choose between rhetoric and action said, ""No, I believe I'll go back to Rochester."" So John Brown then turned to Shiels Greene. Frederick Douglas then turned to Shiels Greene and asked Shiels Greene if he would accompany him. And he did. So if John Brown had sat around to wait for Frederick Douglas to be his ""prince,"" he never would have gone to Harper's Ferry.
So after all that round about introduction, let me read you something Frederick Douglas -- the reason I'd like to read this -- two reasons. First, because it's a great deal of interest among black students and some white students in black history. And, secondly, because that which I'm about to read to you is one of the clearest and cleverest and best written and most articulate expressions of black thought that has ever appeared in the English language. This is from a speech Frederick Douglas Delivered on the 4th of July in 1852. Frederick Douglas had attended a fourth of July celebration and was sitting in the audience probably shooting off firecrackers or eating barbecue or whatever people do on the 4th of July. And someone saw him and said, ""Mr. Douglas, won't you come up and tell us how happy and pleased you are to be living in the United States in 1842, how proud and pleased and overjoyed and grateful and happy and overwhelmed you and your people are to know that you live, in 1852, in the home of the free, the land of the brave, the land of freedom, democracy, equality, Christianity, and brotherhood, and fair play.
And This is what Frederick Douglas said: ""What to the American slave is your Fourth of July? I answer: a day that reveals to him, more than all other days in the year, the gross injustice and cruelty of which he is the constant victim. To him, your celebration is a sham; your boasted liberty, an unholy license; your national greatness, swelling vanity. Your sounds of rejoicing are empty and heartless; your denunciation of tyrants, brass-fronted impudence,
5
your shouts of liberty and equality, hollow mockery; your prayers and hymns, your sermons and thanksgivings, with all your religious parade and solemnity, are, to him, mere bombast, fraud, deception, impiety, and hypocrisy -- a thin veil to cover up crimes which would disgrace a nation of savages. There is not a nation on the earth guilty of practices more shocking and bloody than are the people to the United states, at this very hour.
Go where you may, search where you will, roam through all the monarchies and despotism of the Old World, travel through South America, search out every abuse, and when you have found the last, lay your facts by the sideof the every-day practices of this nation, and you will say with me that, for revolting barbarity and shameless hypocrisy, America reigns without a rival."" History does not report if Frederick Douglas was ever again invited to address a Fourth of July celebration.
Now I want to read you something else. It may seem to some of you as somewhat of an impertinence that I take the time to read these bits of historic memorabilia to you but after all, I have the microphone. This is from another speech given by another man who was equally as great an orator but not as well known. This is very brief; it will not tax you much. It's from a man known as Dr. John S. Rock who was both a medical doctor and an attorney. He lived about, between about 1820 and 1875, and had an occasion to make a speech in Boston, Massachusetts on the fifth of March in 1850. And among the other things he said were these: ""White men may despise, ridicule, slander, and abuse us; they may seek as they always have done to divide us and make us feel degraded. But no man shall cause me to turn my back upon my race. With them I shall sink or swim. The prejudice which some white men have against my color gives me no pain. If any man does not fancy my color, that is his business. And I shall not meddle with it. I shall give myself no trouble because he lacks good taste. Now I cannot deny that I admire the talents of the character of
6
many white men, but I cannot say that I am pleased with their physical appearance. If old mother nature had held out as well as she commenced, I believe we should have had fewer varieties among the races. When I contrast the fine, tough, muscular system, the beautiful rich color, the full, broad features, and the gracefully fizzled hair of the Negro with the delicate physical organization, the wan and washed-out color, the sharp features and lank hair of the Caucasian, I am inclined to believe that when the white man was created, Mother Nature was pretty well exhausted. But determined to keep up appearances, she pinched up his features and did the best could under the circumstances."" Now, I want to tell you one good joke and then I am through. This is a joke that's told in a lot of southern Baptist Churches, and maybe a lot of northern Baptist churches, for all I know. And it's about an elderly black minister who, one day when hunting in the woods, came across an enormour grizzly bear, pointed his rifle and pulled the trigger, and was astounded when the gun failed to shoot. Quickly taking to his heels, as he ran through the woods he began to pray for deliverance. ""Lord, oh Lord, help me; please help me."" And the Lord answered, This is the first time you have prayed to me in about twenty years. Prayer ought to be an every day occurrence. Since you only pray to me when you seem to be in some physical danger, I'm not going to help you."" To which the minister answered. ""Well Lord, if you won't help me, please don't help that bear!""
Now it seems to me that on November the fifth, someone helped the bear. And it would seem to me that those who are fearful of the bear, who have watched the bear over the past several of years that the bear has been prowling in the forest -- have since November fifth had the opportunity to discover what kind of a time we are likely to be in for under the reign of the bear.
We have selected a new president. Now there are some people who think that a new administration might bring peace faster than the Democrats would have.
7
But those who believe that can hardly be cheered by the indication that the puppet dictators of Saigon seem to believe that Mr. Nixon is more friendly to their cause than vice-president Humphrey might have been. Now there are some people who think that a new administration would bring some easing of domestic tensions. But those who believe that can hardly be cheered by the knoledge that this nation has elected a man who said, far in advance of the election that he didn't need black peoples' votes and wouldn't seek them out; a man who said he was publicly in favor of open-housing but privately against it; and a man who said he believed that the Department of Health, Education and Welfare is being too aggressive in enforcing a fourteen year old decision of the United States Supreme Court.
Now, as president, Mr. Nixon has the power to turn back a clock that has been ticking too slowly, particularly for black Americans. He may choose as many as five justices of the United States Supreme Court; and thus determine the character and the decisions the court will make in the remainder of this century. He will name the new attorney general, and the head of the Civil Rights division of the Justice Department and determine the policies and practices they will follow for the next four years. He will staff and direct and determine the policies of the budget of the office of Economic Opportunity, the Department of Health, Education and Welfare, the Department of Housing and Urban Development. He will influence the structure and the composition of the ninety-first and the ninety-second Congress. Now those are not the kinds of decisions one likes to leave to a man whose closest advisers include Stom Thurmond. But, there it is; the choice has been made; the American people have spoken; Democracy has worked its awful will.
The task ahead, particularly for those people who hope for some change through the electoral process, the choice ahead is how to live with it, or, rather, how to continue living in spite of it. Now there are millions of
8
people in this nation who are not affected by those kinds of decisions. They live incomfortable suburbs; they send their children to pleasant schools; they hold down well-paying jobs. Many of these unaffected persons are persons of conscience and good will. They are the kinds of people of may have supported the campaigns of a Nelson Rockefeller of a Eugene McCarthy or George McGovern, or Robert Kennedy, or Richard Gregory, or in some cases an Eldredge Cleaver. They're the kinds of people who want an end to the war in Vietnam; they want equality and justice for black people. But the kinds of decisions made by Mr. Nixon and Mr. Agnew will not affect them. Now the black percentage of the population of this nation face the decision rather easily made on election day. Therefore, most black people cast their votes for vice-president Humphrey, even though it took some doing forsome of us. Because we had felt more warmth that one gets from the Vice-president than one gets from the iciness of the new Nixon.
So now we are faced, now that the election is over, with being ruled by a man we did not want and did not vote for, with being governed by a man who has yet to demostrate that he has any kind of concern for us, or for poor people in general. A man who wants to rebuild our slums with black capitalism which can only mean substituting white exploitation for black exploitation. Under that kind of government, it would seem that every possible step must be taken to build a movement strong enough, and powerful enough to insure that what appears likely to happen in the next four years does not happen again.
Now the black part of this nation faces the next four years, the Nixon-Agnew administration, a congress equally as conservative as the last one, a nation that has grown tired of the demands of the poor and the balck, in a position actually worse than our position has been over the past several years. Forst of all, black Americans are the only Americans who don't know how many of them there are. The Department of Census has admitted, in the Spring of this year,
9
that it had been making a ten percent short count when it counted the black male population. There is unemployment ranging up to forty percent in our neighborhoods and among those of us lucky enough to find some kind of job, a quarter of the employed black, male population earns less than $60 a week, or less than is necessary for a family of four to feed its members seventy cents worth of food every day.
Two years ago, in a speech made at Howard University in Washington, America's leading authority of race relations, President Lyndon B. Johnson, spelled out exactly how bad things are for black people. ""In 1948,"" President Johnson said ""the unemployment rate for Negro teenage boys was less than that for whate boys. By 1964, the unemployment rate for Negro teenage boys had grown to 23%, as against 13% for whites. Between 1949 and 1959, the income of Negro men relative to white men declined in every section of the country. From 1952 to 1963, the median income of Negro families, as compared to white, acturally dropped from 57% to 53%. Since 1947, the number of white families living in poverty has decreased 27%. The number of non-white familes living in poverty (you know who the non-white people are)the number of non-white families living in poverty has decreased (sic) only 3%. . The infant mortality rate for non-whites in 1940 was 70% greater than for whites; in 1952 it was 90% greater.""
We discovered, in 1968, that black people live in conditions so crowded that if all of us lived, that is, if everyone in this nation, every man, woman, and child, in the United States lived as closely together as do some of the people in Harlem, then every man, woman, and child in the United States could live in the Bronx, Brooklyn, and Manhattan. And the other two burroughs of the city of New York, and all the rest of the country would be vacant and empty.
We discovered additionally in 1968, that more of our children are attending segregated schools north of the Mason-Dixon line than didin 1954 when segregation in the public schools was declared illegal.
10
Now, in addition to all those kinds of problems, we are falling victim to a national problem that affects us just slightly more than it affects all other kinds of people. We are falling victim to a war that is fought to suppress liberation abroad in a way that may suppress our eventual liberation at home. That war feeds particularly on the black community. It takes our sons, our brothers, our fathers, our uncles, and our husbands to fight and die in it in greater proportion than it takes any other group of Americans. That war takes black young men, young men so crippled by this society, that an army uniform and three square meals a day seems to them more attractive than life in Harlem, or Watts, or the delta of Mississippi. The war sends them 8000 miles from their homes in what we call an attempt to guarantee freedom, a freedom that is missing from the homes and communities they come from. The war puts
them into integrated fox holes next to young white boys, that this nation with all of its military might cannot seat together in the public schools. And we here, at home, watch them on television, in living color, black and white together, as they burn down the huts of some poor Vietnamese village, realize that they could not live together on most villages in this 
country, and realize, further, that if the young black man is lucky enough to survive and come home he may feel motivated to burn down his own village, using the techniques of skills he has learned defending Americans forces abroad.
The war has done strange things to those of us at home as well. It has turned the labor movement, a force we once looked to as a force in favor of progress and liberalism into a forceful reaction and a force in favor of the status quo. The war has shown us the spectacle of a nation willing to spend $500,000 for every enemy soldier killed, while this nation spends 53.75 for every poor person in the non-violent war on poverty; we fight so half-heartedly at home. And the war has put the nation in the position of defending violence it
11
creates abroad, but denounces violence at home. Now if the struggle in Viet Nam is for the liberation of the south Vietnamese, and if violence is an acceptable tool within that struggle, then, could not violence, and arson and murder, and looting, and burning, and killing become acceptable tools in the liberation struggle of black and brown Americans in this country.
Finally, the war and the whole national confusion and our racial troubles and the assassinations this summer of two men who might have held out some help to some of us, have turned the whole national dialogue upside down. When  you hear the leaders of our nation tell us they are friends of the working man and the poor, what they mean is that they know George Meany. When they say they are men of peace, they mean that they support Marshal Ky. And when they say that they believe in law and order, and justice, they mean it as does Richard J. Daley. Now what has happened identically along with all of the other calamities that beset us as a nation is that the old coalition, the coalition that elected John F. Kennedy president eight years ago, the coalition that most liberal political activists, those to the left of the center, looked upon as the depository of everything of decency and goodness and Christianity and rightousness and correctness in this nation; that whole coalition has begun to collapse. That old coalition was made up of, among other things, all of 
the identifiable national, ethnic groups in this nation. The Irish Americans, Hugarian Americans, and the blacks. Now that coalition has been very generally reduced to two parts -- the black people, and those who hate the black people.
Part of that might coalition was organized labor, but labor is unwilling to organize those who need it the most. And those blue-collar workers, whose earlier struggles brought them to positions of comfortable affluence, now seem to be united only in their insistence that no one else challenge. them for their security or for their jobs. Of that old coalition and its mighty
12
constituent parts, only the black people are left with no place to go.
Now there is a great deal of talk in 1968 of a new coalition, a coalition that quite probably will be a coalition of those that fell unrepresented by any old coalition. But before that coalition can exist, one of its constituent parts, the black people, must have some notion of their relationship to the whole. First we must realize, that although we have won certain kind of rights, political and civil rights, that economic and social rights without political and civil rights still may constitute slavery. And so, our struggle goes on. The struggle of the black man in Watts or Newark is the same as the struggle of the Vietnamese peasant or the South American tin miner, or the Angolan tribesman, the struggle for political, economic, and cultural selfhood and emancipation. The struggle of all the ex-co nialists against all the ex-imperialists.
Now, the struggle as it goes on in Vietnam is being waged with modern weapons of war. the difference about the possible nature of the struggle here is that armed combat would appear to be self-defeating. We live in an era in which the forces of the right have won a national election, in which a half-pint, hillbilly Hitler has won millions of votes, when the nest Vice-President of the United States makes jokes about ""Pollacks"" and ""Japs"" and, quite probably, about ""Spifs"" and""Guineas"" and Niggers,"" in an era in which a committee in the United States House of Representatives has proposed the reestablishment of concentration camps; in an era in which careful study must be given to the methods and actions and techniques that will be adopted by the forces of the third world that exists inside the United States in their struggle for liberation. Now the struggle, as it takes place overseaas, takes, one particular form. The kinds of young men and old men that former
13
United States senator, Lyndon B. Johnson, used to speak of so scornfully as ""little yellow devils with pocket knives"" are demonstrating daily that they will not be deterred in their fight for their own selfdetermination. But here at home, the black and brown and white Americans who want self-determination cannot as easily overthrow a colonial empire which takes money from their communities, which denies them control over community institutions, and which leaves them hungry and jobless, and their families divided. They have tried the process of accomodation and assimiliation believing that the white majority of this countrywould grant us a place of equality and justice. That has been a fragile dream that has failed to come true. We haved tried violence, with some small result. But with the probability that increasing violence will bring on the concentration camps one day sooner. We have tried begging, and heeling, (sic) and bowling and scraping, and they have not worked either.
So we have come a long way. We have won some small victories, and we face, over the next four years, at least, a government which, at best, will be mildly hostile to our desires and our aspirations. So we begin to think, that is, the oppressed black people of this nation, quite probably in concert with the oppressed other colored minorities of this nation, of building up and joining in political coalitions. Now that is not easily done. It requires that there be an end to slogans and rhetoric and to beginning of action. It requires that someone -- and in recent years this task always seems to fall to the young --- requires that some one begin now to organize the large masses of unorganized Americans: the black people, the American Indians, the Spanish-speaking, those poor white people whose condition cries out for change, those middle-class white and black Americans who still retain some of the vestige of liberalism.
That kind of political movement, organized by the young, must be extremely careful whom it excludes. It cannot automatically cut out those kinds of
14
persons who may have voted for George Wallace. It ought to find some ways (don't explode yourself!) it ought to find some way to address itself to their problem and their concerns. The kinds of young people who were brutalized on the streets of Chicago ought not to be excluded from such a new coalition. And most certainly, the new coalition has to include action to solve people's problems, and not simply promises. This nation has made various sorts of promises to various sorts of groups over the years. Black people were promised that patience would bring justice; white people were promised that justice would bring order. Neither has been achieved. We have promised people things would get better, without in fact making them better. Now, in 1968, performance will be measured before other promises can be made.
So there will be attempts made to build new coalitions, with the builders being the young. New coalitions, both North and South, with black people alone, white people alone, and perhaps black and white together. But what will be needed, in addition to an experienced and agitating group of young activists, will be more than just the confluence of people of mutual interest and mutual concern coming together. What will be needed is what that great black man, Frederick Douglas, called for in another speech about one hundred
sixteen years ago. ""It is not the light that is needed,"" Douglas said, ""but fire."" ""It is not the gentle shower, but thunder! We need the storm, the whirlwind, the earthquake. The feeling of the nation must be quickened; the conscience of the nation must be startled; the hypocrisy of the nation must be exposed; its crimes against God and man must be denounced!""
Having done that, having put together a new coalition, having awakened whatever conscience the nation may beassumed to have, we will have in our hands a force with the power to do one of two things. To continue to work in an orderly and peaceful and legal way toward the day that the nation that
15
now fights wars to make the world safe for democracy can assure its citizens that democracy is safe safe for them. Or to smash those who now have power, to seize control from their hands, to use raw power to insure that constitutional rhetoric becomes concrete reality. If that is not done, then perhaps the kind of doleful predictions that speakers like myself always make, will come true.
Now, if you attended a certain kind of church -- I can see by just looking at you most of you do -- then you may have heard of an old song which mentions the ""rainbow sign."" Now the rainbow sign, as you may have seen it, is a hopeful sign; it means there's a pot of gold at the end of it. But the rainbow sign in the old song was not a sign of hope; it was a sign and
a warning of impending doom. Now there is, it appears to me, an abundance of rainbow signs in the United States. They're quite often found in the ghettoes of the big cities in the summer time when its warm and people are out in the street. They are found on American college campuses, quite particularly in California and New York. And they arelikely to be found in the future among all of the communities of the people in this nation who are dissatisfied with the nature and the content of their lives.
The Correct answer to the warning the rainbow sign gives is the one expressed in a poem, written by the late Langston Hughes some years ago, in which he asks the rhetorical question:
What happens to a dream deferred?
Does it fester like a raisin in the sun,
or just explode?
Now there have been several sorts of explosions in this nation in the past few years, and they have been largely the explosion of the festering of the dreams of the black, urban population. The likelihood is that there will be a great many more ""dreams deferred"" -- and festerings -- and explosions. And if that is so, then the warning expressed by the old son about the rainebow sign is likely to come true. Because the old song says:

That is race. Most of my life has been colored by race, so you will pardon me if most of my address is colored by race.
Let me begin by trying to describe exactly where black Americans find themselves in 1969, and go from there to list some of the ways we have tried to improve that condition.
To begin with, we are becoming with most of America, an urban population. In Washington, D. C., where we can't elect a dog catcher, much less a mayor, we are over 60% of the population. In Richmond, Nashville, New Orleans, Jacksonville and Birmingham, we are over 40% of the population. Atlanta, Compton, California, Gary Indiana, Baltimore, St. Louis, Newark, Detroit and Trenton will have majority black populations by 1970.
We know too that some things in America over the past several years have gotten better for some few of us.
We can eat where we never ate before, go to school where we never went to school before, and can sit in the front of buses that never used to stop. There are more Negroes holding elective office today in all parts of this country, and more Negroes making more money now than ever before. More of us are registered to vote and more of us are voting.
But for most of us, things have not gotten better. Let me quote America's authority of race relations; President Lyndon B. Johnson:
""In 1948,"" the President said, ""the 8% unemployment rate for Negro teenage boys was actually less than that of whites. By 1964, the rate for Negroes had grown to 23% as against 13% for
Page 2
whites. Between 1949 and 1959, the income of Negro men relative to white men declined in every section of the country. From 1952 to 1963, the median income of Negro families compared to white actually dropped from 57 to 53 per cent. Since 1947, the number of white families living in poverty has decreased 27 per cent, while the number of non- white families living in poverty has decreased only 3 per cent. The infant mortality of non-whites in 1940 was 70 per cent greater than whites. In 1962, it was 90 per cent greater.""
To use President Johnson's figures, the rate of unemployment for Negroes and whites in 1930 was about the same. In 1965, the Negro rate was twice as high.
We must in all candor admit that poverty is not the exclusive province of America's blacks. There are poor white people as well. They, however, enjoy the dubious distinction of knowing they are not poor because they are white, but rather they are poor in spite of their whiteness.
Unemployment in the black ghetto runs between 30 and 50 per cent, as compared with about 4 per cent for Americans as a whole. 357,000 black men and 419,000 black women are officially out of work. Another 300,000 to 400,000 of the ""hidden jobless"" aren't being counted. Unemployment among black youth between the ages of 16 and 21 is six times higher for whites in the same age group.
Those are awful facts and figures. They are all the more awful because they are familiar to most literate Americans and have been familiar for more than 10 years. They are more awful because most literate Americans have chosen to do nothing about them.
Some efforts have been made, however.
Page 3
Since 1954, there have been various sorts of methods and techniques directed at solving America’s white problem. These have included the sit-in demonstration and nonviolent march, the pursuit of education as a barrier breaker, the use of violence as an inducement to change, the challenging in the courts of segregation by law, and the thrust for power through political action. 
Let us examine each of these. 
Legalisms and legal action brought us in 1954 a statement from the nation’s highest court that segregation was illegal. 14 years later, there are more black children attending all-black schools North of the Mason - Dixon line than there were in 1954. 
One might add here that the one man called “liberal” in the Nixon cabinet, the former Lieutenant Governor of California, has seen fit, within his first month in office, to make concessions to the Cinderella bridegroom from South Carolina. He has given five Southern school districts 60 additional days in which to decide whether they will obey a 14 year old decision of the United States Supreme Court. Surely this is a reflection on the quality of white education in these districts when constitutionality and law means so little in a region of the country noted for its adherence to law and order. 
Sit-in demonstrations and marches won the integrated lunch counter, toilet, bus station, movie theatre and the right to vote. 
Each of these first victories had had little meaning for most black people and the last - the right to vote - has yet to win bread and butter victories for the millions now voting for the first time. 
Page 4
Education as a means of improving conditions for the masses dies every day that ghetto schools continue to teach that whiteness is rightness. Education is a useless tool when education systems become so large and so impersonal as to deny neither parent, nor student nor teacher the right to participate in educational decisions. 
Violence as a political technique has not had a real test in the country, and the present national mood seems to suggest to me that continued repression will follow another long, hot summer. 
In the immediate past few years, the country at large has begun to change. 
In 1964, the poor American community was promised that poverty would end. By 1967, a foreign war had rendered that promise - if it was ever meant - nearly useless. Between 1961 and 1964, the country officially denounced violence and war as a means of settling disputes between persons or nations. From 1965 to the present, violence has been the official policy of the government of the United States in settling her own disputes with other nations, and that belief has seeped into the police stations and slums across the land. 
In 1964, young black men thought he might get a job, but in 1968, the only job open to him was being a soldier. War brewed anger in the black community, and it gave birth to the belief that nonviolence was only a joke to be played on or played by the black community. 
Page 5
It is curious to note the similarities of the national response to problems here and abroad. First we try a little economic aid, and urge local authorities to give the peasants a bone of reform. In Vietnam this is called pacification; at home it is the Poverty Program. Next when trouble erupts, counter insurgency is used - in Vietnam the local militias, in America, the police. And when the peasants shoot back, we bomb the hell out of them. 
Following this thought into a logical and local ending, we shall next see in America the “resettlement” of Negroes into well-policed villages. 
In fact, that resettlement has already begun. We do live in villages within the city, policed well when police action is aimed against us, policed poorly to contain the violent forces that operate in our lives daily. 
Is not the status quo as violent as any Watts or Newark or Detroit? Is it not violent to condemn to death twice the proportion of black babies as white babies in their first year? Is it not violent to send twice the proportion of black men as white men to Vietnam every year? 
There are those in America who believe that a non-violent confrontation will force a reluctant government to turn its attention homeward and toward a real solution of the white problem in America. 
There are those who believe that progress of a sort is being made and will be made, and like Scarlett O’Hara, believe tomorrow will be another - and perhaps a better - day. 
Page 6
There are those who are convinced that nothing good will come tomorrow unless the structure of today is changed, and who will willingly kill and die on these streets either in frustration and rage or in the faint hope that from destruction will come a newer, better day. 
There are those who believe that giving some small power the appearance of control of neighborhood schools, decision making in some forms of government - will hold off the day of Armageddon that many think is coming. 
And there are those for whom the major problem has become the right to smoke pot, to throw flowers, while for others the fight is for the right to breathe air or to throw bombs. 
Non-violent confrontations have their place. The English gave in to Ghandi’s demonstrations. We ought to remember that the English were said to have a conscience, while this government is thought to have none. If this is any indication of conscience, it is a sad one. Out of all of the members of the United States House of Representatives, only 36 could be found to support the recommendations of the President’s Committee on Civil Disorders. 
When one looks for an answer to what is called the domestic crises, or the urban crises, one ought to look at the places where these problems are the most concentrated. That place in what Dr. Kenneth Clark has called the “dark ghetto”. 
“The dark ghettoes,” Clark writes, “are social, political, educational - and above all - economic colonies. Their inhabitants are subject people, victims of the greed, cruelty, insensitivity, guilt, and fear of their masters.” 
Page 7
Using that description, the terms “colony” and “colonized people” will correctly describe the condition of those dark millions who even today are deserting the mechanized feudal system of the South for the more highly-mechanized - and more highly segregated, in a sophisticated way - ghettoes of the North and West. 
From the colonies must come a new movement and a new method. 
We ought to remind ourselves there of the method an earlier colony on these shores took to free itself from oppression - that method was armed rebellion, insurrection, seizure of property, death and destruction, the American way of 1776. 
If a new sort of movement springs from the active protests and organizing drives of the early sixties, it must be first of all (small “d”) democratic. It must extend to every member of the black community the opportunity to have a say in who gets how much of what from whom. It must cast its votes in a unit, it must deal with problems on a local, regional, national and international basis, and it must decide that freedoms not enjoyed in Watts or Sunflower County cannot be enjoyed in Westchester County. 
It must declare itself in the interests of laboring people, but not become the mistress of organized labor. 
It has to seek out its natural allies in the Spanish speaking community, but must not close its eyes to potential allies in middle class suburbia. 
It must pay as much attention to a street light in a 50-foot alley as it does to national legislation involving millions of people, and international complications involving the future of the world. 
Page 8
It must maintain a militance and an aggressiveness that will earn it the respect of those it hopes to lead. 
If there are any rules peculiar to this new movement in politics, they would be these: 
1. That social, economic, educational, political and physical segregation and discrimination fill a very real need for the white majority;
2. That appeals to justice and fair play are outmoded and useless when power, financial gain and prestige are at stake;
3. That positions of segregation and discrimination will be adhered to until change is forced through coercion, threats, power or violence;
4. That initiative for black political education and organization must come from within the Negro community and must be sustained on a day-by-day basis;
5. That the geographical distribution of Negroes makes Negro - white coalitions desirable, but only when based on racial self-interest and genuine equality between the coalescing groups; but
6. That racial self-interest, race consciousness and racial solidarity must always be paramount in the deeds and words of the black political animal; when self-interest is forgotten, organized racism will continue to dominate and frustrate the best organized political actions of any black political unit, and will leave it powerless and defenseless. 
This new movement must address itself to solving America’s white problem, to developing a new sophistication and consciousness in the black and white communities, and in making democracy safe for the world. 
Page 9
Peaceful protests - and the bloodied heads of anonymous thousands - have won the lunch counter seat, the bus station bench, the integrated toilet and the vote. 
This new movement can be a tool for further, more meaningful gains, the gains that fill bellies and build homes and schools, but only if we reject the dangerous sort of equality that we are winning today. 
That equality gives us an equal chance to be poor, and equal chance to be unemployed, an equal chance to drop out of school, and a more than equal chance to fight for someone else’s freedoms thousands of miles from home. 
That equality must be suppressed and replaced with an equality that provides full employment or guaranteed incomes, and makes the American nightmare the American dream. 
Only when we have gotten ourselves together, only when we shall have decided who our enemies are and where the battleground ought to be, only when we know in our hearts we are right and only when we demand that our worse off are treated as well as white America’s best off will be begin to see whether this system and this method can make a difference in our lives. 
Having done all that, having built a new movement, having forged a new majority coalition, having put people in motion, one further thing will be needed, from black and white, rich and poor alike. 
That one further thing is something simple. It is what high school and college graduation speakers urge upon their charges. It is called commitment. 
Page 10
In our terms, it means the kind of commitment from young people that would have kept the South in ferment from the heady days of 1964 til the present; it is the kind of commitment that takes over the dean’s office one day, but the welfare office the next; the kind of commitment that will mean year round participation in a new politics, a people’s politics, a politics that will insure a choice, and not an echo, at the top of the ballot in November 1972. 
And it will require that each of us keep in mind a prohecy written by the late Langston Hughes - that dreams deferred do explode. 
For if this dream is deferred much longer, then an explosion will come - and in the words of the old song it will be like God giving Noah the rainbow sign; no more water, the fire next time. 
The late - and great - Dr. W. E. B. DuBois wrote that the problem of the 20th Century would be the problem of the color line. 
He later restated this belief to include the problem of those who have not pitted against those who have, and wrote a remarkable personal credo, a portion of which I should like to leave with you. 
He wrote in 1904, 565 years ago: 
I believe in God who made of one blood all races that dwell on earth. I believe that all men, black and brown and white are brothers, varying, through time and opportunity, in form and gift and feature, but differing in no essential particular, and alike in soul and in the possibility of infinite development. 
Page 11
Especially do I believe in the Negro race; in the beauty of its genius, the sweetness of its soul, and its strengths in that meekness which shall inherit this turbulent earth. 
I believe in the Prince of Peace. I believe that war is murder. I believe that armies, and navies are at the bottom the tinsel and braggadocio of oppression and wrong; and I believe that the wicked conquest of weaker and darker nations by nations white and stronger but foreshadows the death of that strength. 
I believe in liberty for all men; the space to stretch their arms and their souls; the right to breath… the freedom to choose their friends, enjoy the sunshine… uncursed by color; thinking, dreaming, working as they will in a kingdom of God and love. 
Finally, I believe in patience - patience with the weakness of the weak and the strength of the strong, the prejudice of the ignorant and the ignorance of the blind; patience with the tardy triumph of joy and the mad chastening of sorrow- patience with God.

Let me begin by trying to describe exactly where black Americans find ourselves now, and go from there to list some of the ways we have tried to improve that condition. 
To begin with, we are becoming, with most of America, an urban population. In Washington, D. C., where we can't elect a dog catcher, much less a mayor, we are over 60% of the population. In Richmond, Nashville, New Orleans, Jacksonville and Birmingham we are over forty percent of the population. Atlanta, Compton California, Gary Indiana, Baltimore, St. Louis, Newark, Detroit and Trenton will all have majority black populations by the mid 1970s.
We know too that some things in America over the past several years have gotten better for some few of us. 
We can eat where we have never eaten before, go to school where we never went to school before, and can sit in the front 
2
of busses that never used to stop. There are more black people holding elective office today in all parts of this country, and more blacks making more money now than ever before. More of us are registered to vote and more of us are voting. 
But for most of us, things have not gotten better. 
Since the typical black person is poor, he faces all of the problems of all the poor. For example, although there are more than five and one half million units of substandard housing in the United States, and although Congress declared in 1949 that every American has a right to a decent home, in those twenty years, urban renewal, highway construction and other forces have destroyed 100,000 more homes for low income people than have been built. 
3
At the end of the second World War, the median income for white families was $3,150.; for blacks, a little more than $1600. Today, the average white family has an income of more than $6500 a year, while the black family in come is about $3400, the white family, in other words, has gained about $1800. In spite of laws and courts and marches and summer urban disruptions, the white family has moved twice as far ahead of its black counterpart than it was twenty years ago. 
Low income black people suffer four times the national incidence of heart disease; ten times the incidence of defective vision. In black urban America, thirty percent of the people have never seen a doctor; half of the expectant mothers never have prenatal care. 
The truth, then, is that
For nearly all of the Americans where skins are Black, Brown, Yellow or Red, the “American Dream” has been a cruel nightmare. Their reality has been the highest rate of unemployment, the lowest wages, the worst housing, the poorest education, the highest infant mortality rate and the shortest life expectancy. 
They have been the victims of irreparable physical, psychological, and economic damage. They have suffered from a continuous pathology imposed on them by a political system run on the principal of majority rights enforced by majority decisions, and by an economic system that has always believed that property is more important than people. 
These are all demonstrable facts to any literate person. Their continuation has been certified a national shame and disgrace by every President since Franklin Roosevelt. The dire consequences for a society that condones such racial arrogance have been more than spelled out by Commission after Commission. 
But yet, the statistics continue to mount. Figures which were disturbing ten years ago are frightening now. Conditions which were deplorable then are abomnible now. 
As the tensions rises, the mood which in the mid-sixties suggested a solution soon is slowly sapped. 
Wherever we live in America, Black people are victims of social disaster. ""From every rural community in Alabama to the high-rise compounds in Chicago, we are a people in agony. . . .Our cities are haunted by crime and we are the greatest victims. Many of us - young and able and old and disabled - face permanent unemployment or a lifetime in government supported poverty. 
Such lives belong to real people - 20 million Blacks, five million Chicanos, 3 million Puerto Ricans, half-a-million Native Americans. 
These real people have seen solution after solution slowly sift away. 
7
We must in all candor admit that poverty is not the exclusive province of America's blacks. There are poor white people as well. They, however, enjoy the dubious distinction of knowing they are not poor because they are white, but rather they are poor in spite of their whiteness.
We must, then, assume that the Racial problem in this country is one of race and class. Three million, five hundred thousand Americans are right now looking for work they won’t find. Another million more. . . No one knows how many for sure . . . Have given up looking and are no longer counted as “unemployed” by the labor department. 
Unemployment in the black ghetto runs between thirty and fifty percent, as compared with about four 5 plus percent for America 
5
as a whole. Unemployment among black youth between the ages of sixteen and twenty one is six times higher for whites in the same age group. 
If you were to examine the typical black ghetto dweller, this is what you would find: if he is a young adult, there is better than a fifty per cent chance he has dropped out of high school. He is not only unemployed, but by current standards he is unemployable. He has no salable skill. Neither of his parents went beyond the eighth grade. He entered school at six, but because of overcrowding, had to attend half day sessions. During his six years in elementary school, he attended four different schools. 
What is his immediate history, and the history of his parents?
6 
What sorts of efforts were made by them to improve their condition? 
Since 1917, this country has had sporadic racial violence. Interestingly, it has always occurred during periods of war: 1917 to 1919, in 1943, and from 1965 into [1968] the 70s. 
Since 1954, there have been various sorts of methods and techniques directed at solving America’s white problem. Those include the sit in and nonviolent march, the pursuit of education as a barrier breaker, the use of violence as inducement to change, the challenging in the courts of segregation by law and the thrust for power through political action. 
Let us examine each of these. 
Legalisms and legal action brought us in 1954 a statement from the nation’s highest court that segregation was legal. [17?] 18 years later, there are more black children attending all black 
7
schools north of the Mason Dixon line than there were in 1954.
Sit in demonstrations and marches won the integrated lunch counter, toilet, bus station, movie theatre and the right to vote. 
Each of these first victories has had little meaning for most black people and the last . . . The right to vote . . . Has yet to win substantial and lasting bread and butter victories for most of the millions now voting for the first time. 
Education as a means of improving conditions for the masses dies every day that ghetto American schools continue to teach that whiteness is rightness. 
Violence as a political technique has not had a real test in this country, and the present national mood seems to suggest to me that continued repression will follow another long, hot summer.
8 
In the immediate past few years of the life of our imaginary ghetto dweller, the country at large has begun to change. 
In 1964, his community was promised that poverty would end. By 1967, a foreign war had rendered that promise . . . If it was ever meant . . . nearly useless. Between 1961 and 1964, the country officially denounced violence and war as a means of settling disputes between persons or nations. From 1965 to the present, violence has been the official policy of the government of the United States in settling her own disputes with other nations, and that belief has seeped into the police stations and slums across the land. 
In 1964, our young black slum dweller thought he might get a job, but in 1968 the 70s, the only job open to him was being a soldier. 
9
War brewed anger in the black community, and it gave birth to the belief that nonviolence was only a joke to be played on or played by the black community. 
It is curious to note the similarities of the national response to problems here and abroad. First we try a little economic aid, and urge local authorities to give the peasants a bone of reform. In Vietnam this is called ""pacification; at home it is the Poverty Program. Next when trouble erupts, counter insurgency is used: in Vietnam the local militias, in America, the police. And when the peasants shoot back, we bomb the hell out of them. 
There are differences, however. In Vietnam, we are spending each year over three 30 billion dollars in our interference into 
10
the political future of fourteen million Vietnamese. We surely ought to be able to spend that much on twenty two million black Americans, whose future affects this country much more than the lessons on democracy being taught at the point of a gun in Southeast Asia’s rice paddies. 
Physical violence is a preoccupation with those who wonder what black America wants. They dismiss the violence of wrenching a people from their homeland, separating mother from father, parents from children, the violence of the slave plantation, the violence of the racist South, the institutional violence that produces an infant mortality rate among blacks that is twice that for whites, and rising, the violence in men’s minds that devised Jim Crow. 
Black people believe that the status quo is as violent as Watts or Newark or Detroit. It is violent, we say, to send twice the proportion of black men as white men to Vietnam to fight and 
11
die every year. It is violent to be black in America today. 
There are answers to our problems, but they must be sought among the troubled and among the young. One must know . . . If not understand . . . What life is like in the dark ghetto today. 
“The dark ghettoes,” Dr. Kenneth Clark writes, “are social political, educational . . . and above all . . . economic colonies. Their inhabitants are subject people, victims: of the greed, cruelty, insensitivity, guilt and fear of their masters.” 
The terms “colony” and “colonized people” will then correctly describe the condition of those millions who even today are deserting the mechanized feudal system of the South for the more highly mechanized . . and more highly segregated, in a sophisticated way . . ghettoes of the north and west. 
From the colonies must come a new movement, and a new 
What is at stake here is the elimination of power imbalances between American groups, the fight against the concentration of wealth, of power, and priviledge - both open and covert, both legal and illegal - the struggle is for a fairer and more equitable distribution of wealth and power. 
This fight for fairness is political; it can only be won by organizing a new majority, a noisy majority, in the United States. 
That is a simple process. It memelr calls for your involvement in my profession, in politics, in the second oldest profession in the world. 
Politics is not the art of the possible, as you may have learned in high school civics; its not the art of compromise, but a much more serous, more exacting art - the art of seeing who gets how much of what from whom. 
The best advocates of what kind of politics are the people themselves - be they Vietnamese or Africans, labor or the poor, neighborhood or ethnic, Chicanos or the aged. That is the process - the joining together of those without power or resources to change institutions and to bring about a rebalance. 
That calls for building a movement in this country, and movement from the center to the left, a movement that can change the name and nature of the president of the United States. 
For many Americans, an exchange if Presidents is nothing more than an exchange of photographs on the post office wall, or on a dormitory wall dart board. For Black people, the issue is whether we progress, whether we run in place, or whether we continue sliding backward as we have done since 1968. 
The new President will choose at least two more Justices on the United States Supreme Court - if that’s not important, ask the men on deat row in America’s prisons who wait for a ruling on whether or not the state shalltake their lives. 
He will name a new Attorney General of the United States - if that’s not important, ask the parents of students killex at Jackson State and Kent by policemen and guardsmen who have yet to face any official punishment. 
He will set the budget and determine the policies of the Departments of Health, Education and Welfare, of Housing and Urban Development. 
He will decide whether wesend more men to the moon, or whether we find jobs and homes for men here on earth. 
He will help decide whether we produce bombs for innocent children in Asia, or whether we produce books for innocent schoolchildren at home. 
Because of the majesty of his office, he will help decide whether the nation will continue to bethe country where property is more important than people, where welfare capitalism exists for the poor and socialism for the wealthy, where the few have what the many need and the many remain the people in need. 
The civil rights drives and voter registration movements of the mid-sixties mark the only time in recent American history when young people sustained - for more than a college semester - an abiding, active interest in the condition of those less fortunate than they. 
The idealism and activism of that era needs to be revived again, not out of the current wave of nostalga that has hit the campus, but out of a historical lesson that proves change can be achieved by citizen action, and that it will be achieved again. 
It could be done by rebuilding such a movement, but it never will be done by people who think they can smoke America to her knees; it never will be done by people who think they can measure their handshake; it nenver will be done by people who believe their social worth is measured by their commitment to macrobiotic diets, arstology, or who think their revolutionary fervor is indicated by the heat generated by esoteric debates 
about the relative revisionism of the late Ho Chi Minh. 
It could be done, however ……….. 
17
America’s best off will we begin to see whether this system and this method can make a difference in our lives. 
Having done all this, and having done it by whatever means and with whatever allies are available, then we may be in a position to seek greater goals for ourselves; then we may be in a position to make the American dream stop being a nightmare. 
As Frederick Douglass once said: “Men may not get all they pay for in the world but they certainly pay for all they get. If we ever get free from the oppression and wrongs heaped upon us, we must pay for their removal. We must do this by labor, by suffering, by sacrifice, and if need be, by our lives and the lives of others.” 
***
__________
Before I begin, I must admit to a prejudice, a bias. That is race. Most of my life has been colored by race, so you will pardon me if most of my address is colored by race.
Let me begin by trying to describe exactly where black Americans find themselves in 1968, and go from there to list some of the ways we have tried to improve that condition. 
To begin with, we are becoming, with most of America, an urban population. In Washington, D.C., where we can’t elect a dog catcher, much less a mayor, we are over 60% of the population. In Richmond, Nashville, New Orleans, Jacksonville and Birmingham, we are over 40% of the population. Atlanta, Compton, California, Gary Indiana, Baltimore, St. Louis, Newark, Detroit and Trenton will have majority black populations by 1970. 
We know too that some things in America over the past several years have gotten better for some few of us. 
We can eat where we never ate before, go to school where we never went to school before, and can sit in front of buses that never used to stop. There are more Negroes holding elective office today in all parts of this country, and more Negroes making more money now than ever before. More of us are registered to vote and more of us are voting. 
But for most of us, things have not gotten better. Let me quote America’s authority of race relations; President Lyndon B. Johnson: “In 1948,” the President said, ""the 8% unemployment rate for Negro teenage boys was actually less than that of whites. By 1964, the rate for Negroes has grown to 23% as against 13% for 
Page 2
whites. Between 1949 and 1959, the income of Negro men relative to white men declined in every section of the country. From 1952 to 1963, the median income of Negro families compared to white actually dropped from 57 to 53 per cent. Since 1947, the number of white families living in poverty has decreased only 3 per cent. The infant mortality of non-whites in 1940 was 70 percent greater than whites. In 1962, it was 90 percent greater."" 
To use President Johnson’s figures, the rate of unemployment for Negroes and whites in 1930 was about the same. In 1965, the Negro rate was twice as high. 
We must in all candor admit that poverty is not the exclusive province of America’s blacks. There are poor white people as well. They, however, enjoy the dubious distinction of knowing they are not poor because they are white, but rather they are poor in spite of their whiteness. 
Unemployment in the black ghetto runs between 30 and 50 per cent, as compared with about 4 per cent for Americans as a whole. 357,000 black men and 419,000 black women are officially out of work. Another 300,000 to 400,000 of the “hidden jobless” aren’t being counted. Unemployment among black youth between the age of 16 and 21 is six times higher for whites in the same age group. 
Those are awful facts and figures. They are all the more awful because they are familiar to most literate Americans, and have been familiar for more than 10 years. They are more awful because most literate Americans have chosen to do nothing about them.
Some efforts have been made, however. 
Page 3
Since 1954, there have been various sorts of methods and techniques directed at solving America’s white problem. These have included the sit-in demonstration and nonviolent march, the pursuit of education as a barrier breaker, the use of violence as inducement to change, the challenging in the courts of segregation by law and the thrust for power through political action. 
Let us examine each of these.
Legalisms and legal action brough us in 1954 a statement from the nation's highest court that segregation was illegal. 14 years later, there are more black children attending all-black schools North of the Mason - Dixon line than there were in 1954.
One might add here that the one man called ""liberal"" in the Nixon cabinet, the former Lieutenant Governor of California, has seen fit, within his first month in office, to make concessions to the Cinderella bridegroom from South Carolina. He has given five Southern school districts 60 additional days in which to decide whether they will obey a 14 year old decision of the United States Supreme Court. Surely this is a reflection on the quality of white education in these districts when constitutionality and law means so little in a region of the country noted for its adherence to law and order.
Sit-in demonstrations and marches won the integrated lunch counter, toilet, bus station, movie theatre and the right to vote.
Each of these first victories had had little meaning for most black people and the last - the right to vote - has yet to win bread and butter victories for the millions now voting for the first time.
Page 4
Education as a means of improving conditions for the masses dies every day that ghetto schools continue to teach whiteness as rightness. Education is a useless tool when education systems become so large and so impersonal as to deny either parent, or student or teacher the right to participate in educational decisions. 
Violence as a political technique has not had a real test in the country, and the present national mood seems to suggest to me that continued repression will follow another long, hot summer. 
In the immediate past few years, the country at large has begun to change. 
In 1964, the poor American community was promised that poverty would end. By 1967, a foreign war had rendered that promise - if it was ever meant - nearly useless. Between 1961 and 1964, the country officially denounced violence and war as a means of settling disputes between persons or nations. From 1965 to the present, violence has been the official policy of the government of the United States in settling her own disputes with other nations, and that belief has seeped into the police stations and slums across the land. 
In 1964, young black men thought he might get a job, but in 1968, the only job open to him was being a soldier. War brewed anger in the black community and it gave birth to the belief that nonviolence was only a joke to be played on or played by the black community.

It is curious to note the similarities of the national response to the problems here and abroad. First we try a little economic aid, and urge local authorities to give the peasants a bone of reform. In Vietnam this is called pacification; at home it is the Poverty Program. Next when trouble erupts, counter insurgency is used - in Vietnam the local militias, in America, the police. And when the peasants shoot back, we bomb the hell out of them. 
Following this thought into a logical and local ending, we shall next see in America the “resettlement” of Negroes into well-policed villages. 
In fact, the resettlement has already begun. We do live in villages within the city, policed well when police action is aimed against us, policed poorly to contain the violent forces that operate in our lives daily. 
Is not the status quo as violent as any Watts or Newark or Detroit? Is it not violent to condemn to death twice the proportion of black babies as white babies in their first year? Is it not violent to send twice the proportion of black men as white men to Vietnam every year? 
There are those in America who believe that a non-violent confrontation will force a reluctant government to turn its attention homeward and toward a real solution of the white problem in America. 
There are those who believe that progress of a sort is being made and will be made, and like Scarlett O’Hara, believe tomorrow will be another - and perhaps a better - day. 
Page 6
There are those who are convinced that nothing good will come tomorrow unless the structure of today is changed, and who will willingly kill and die on these streets either in frustration and rage or in the faint hope that from destruction will come a newer, better day. 
There are those who believe that giving some small power- the appearance of control of neighborhood schools, decision making in some forms of government - will hold off the day of Armageddon that many think is coming. 
And there are those for whom the major problem has become the right to smoke pot, to throw flowers, while for others the fight is for the right to breathe air and throw bombs. 
Non-violent confrontations have their place. The English gave in to Gandhi’s demonstrations. We ought to remember that the English were said to have a conscience, while this government is thought to have none. If this is any indication of conscience, it is a sad one. Out of all of the members of the United States House of Representatives, only 36 could be found to support the recommendations of the President’s Committee on Civil Disorders. 
When one looks for an answer to what is called the domestic crises, or the urban crises, one ought to look at the places where these problems are the most concentrated. That place in what Dr. Kenneth Clark has called the “dark ghetto”. 
“The dark ghettoes,” Clark writes, “are social, political, educational - and above all - economic colonies. Their inhabitants are subject people, victims of the greed, cruelty, insensitivity, guilt and fear of their masters.” 
Page 7
Using that description, the terms “colony” and “colonized people” will correctly describe the condition of those dark millions who even today are deserting the mechanized feudal system of the South for the more highly-mechanized - and more highly segregated, in a sophisticated way - ghettoes for the North and West. 
From the colonies must come a new movement and a new method. 
We ought to remind ourselves there of the method an earlier colony on these shores took to free itself from oppression - that method was armed rebellion, insurrection, seizure of property, death and destruction, the American way of 1776. 
If a new sort of movement springs from the active protests and organizing drives of the early sixties, it must be first of all (small “d”) democratic. It must extend to every member of the black community the opportunity to have a say in who gets how much of what from whom. It must cast its vote in a unit, it must deal with problems on a local, regional, national and international basis, and it must decide that freedom not enjoyed in Watts or Sunflower County cannot be enjoyed in Westchester County. 
It must declare itself in the interests of laboring people, but not become the mistress of organized labor. 
It has to seek out its natural allies in the Spanish speaking community, but must close its eyes to potential allies in middle school suburbia. 
It must pay as much attention to a street light in a 50-foot alley as it does to national legislation involving millions of people, and international complications involving the future of the world. 
Page 8
It must maintain a militance and an aggressiveness that will earn it the respect of those it hopes to lead. 
If there are any rules peculiar to this new movement in politics, they would be these: 
1. That social, economic, educational, political and physical segregation and discrimination fill a very real need for the white majority;
2. That appeals to justice and fair play are outmoded and useless when power, financial gain and prestige are at stake;
3. That positions of segregation and discrimination will be adhered to until change is forced through coercion, threats, power or violence;
4. That initiative for black political education and organization must come from within the Negro community and must be sustained on a day-by-day basis;
5. That the geographical distribution of Negroes makes Negro - white coalitions desirable, but only when based on racial self-interest and genuine equality between the coalescing groups; but
6. That racial self-interest, race consciousness and racial solidarity must always be paramount in the deeds and words of the black political animal; when self-interest is forgotten, organized racism will continue to dominate and frustrate the best organized political actions of any black political unit, and will leave it powerless and defenseless 
This new movement must address itself to solving America’s white problem, to developing a new sophistication and consciousness in the black and white communities, and in making democracy safe for the world. 
Page 9
Peaceful protests - and the bloodied heads of anonymous thousands - have won the lunch counter seat, the bus station bench, the integrated toilet and the vote. 
This new movement can be a tool for further, more meaningful gains, the gains that fill bellies and build homes and schools, but only if we reject the dangerous sort of equality that we are winning today. 
That equality gives us an equal chance to be poor, and equal chance to be unemployed, an equal chance to drop out of school, and a more than equal chance to fight for someone else’s freedoms thousands of miles from home. 
That equality must be suppressed and replaced with an equality that provides full employment or guaranteed incomes, and makes the American nightmare the American dream. 
Only when we have gotten ourselves together, only when we shall have decided who our enemies are and where the battleground ought to be, only when we know in our hearts we are right and only when we demand that our worse off are treated as America’s best off will be begin to see whether this system and this method can make a difference in our lives. 
Having done all that, having built a new movement, having forged a new majority coalition, having put people in motion, one further thing will be needed, from black and white, rich and poor alike. 
That one further thing is something simple. It is what high school and college graduation speakers urge upon their charges. It is called commitment. 
Page 10
In our terms, it means the kind of commitments from young people that would have kept the South in ferment from the heady days of 1964 til the present; it is the kind of commitment that takes over the dean’s office one day, but the welfare office the next; the kind of commitment that will mean year round participation in a new politics, a people’s politics, a politics that will insure a choice, and not an echo, at the top of the ballot in November 1972. 
And it will require that each of us keep in mind a prophecy written by the late Langston Hughes - that dreams deferred do explode. 
For if this dream is deferred much longer, then an explosion will come - and in the words of the old song it will be like God giving Noah the rainbow sign; no more water, the fire next time. 
The late - and great - Dr. W. E. B. DuBois wrote that the problem of the 20th Century would be the problem of the color line. 
He later restated this belief to include the problem of those who have not pitted against those who have, and wrote a remarkable personal credo, a portion of which I should like to leave with you. 
He wrote in 1904, 55 years ago: 
I believe in God who made of one blood all races that dwell on earth. I believe that all men, black and brown and white are brothers, varying, through time and opportunity, in form and gift and feature, but differing in no essential particular, and alike in soul and in the possibility of infinite development. 
Page 11
Especially do I believe in the Negro race; in the beauty of its genius, the sweetness of its soul, and its strengths in that meekness which shall inherit this turbulent earth. 
I believe in the Prince of Peace. I believe that war is murder. I believe that ’armies, and navies are at the bottom of the tinsel and braggadacio of oppression and wrong; and I believe that the wicked conquest of weaker and darker nations by nations white and stronger but foreshadows the death of that strength. 
I believe in liberty for all men; the space to stretch their arms and their souls; the right to breath…. the freedom to choose their friends, enjoy the sunshine…. uncured by color; thinking, dreaming, working as they will in a kingdom of God and love. 
Finally, I believe in patience - patience with the weakness of the weak and the strength of the strong, the prejudice of the ignorant and the ignorance of the blind; patience with the tardy triumph of joy and the mad chastening of sorrow - patience with God."

Poverty, American style, has its geographical roots in rural America. The last two years have shown an upsurge in interest in recognizing that there are millions of poor Americans, a disproportionate share of them black.
We declared war against their condition in 1964. Unlike the war in Vietnam, this war was debated in Congress. Unlike the war in Vietnam, this war had difficulty getting funds. But like the war in Vietnam, our generals told us we were winning this war while all along we should have known we were losing and the enemy, like in the war in Vietnam, has been winning.
As in Biafra, it must have been the sight of hungry, starving children which caught this nation's attention. It was horrifying for Americans to see the swelled bellies, listless eyes of starving children in a country with 60 billion automobiles and 70 million television sets.
It was shocking to discover:
- this country spends as much for chewing gum as for Model Cities
- we spend as much for hair dye as for grants to urban mass transit.
- we spend as much for pet food as we do on food stamps for the poor.
- we spend as much or more for tabacco than the government spends on all levels for higher education
- we spend as a nation $300 million dollars for jewelry and argue in Congress over $10 million for the Teacher Corps
For two weeks last year the nation sat still and listened to a tale or rural poverty and hunger. A group called the ""Citizens Board of Inquiry"" told us some unpleasant facts.
""Millions of Americans are being deprived of the food they need,"" the report said. The ""hunger counties"" this group discovered were largely in the South and Southwest, and were largely rural in population. Even though hungry people held the spotlight for only two weeks, there was some action taken. The Department of Agriculture, the Office of Economic Opportunity, the Department of Health, Education and Welfare together announced an emergency $10 million dollar program to provide food and medical aid for the poor.
The $10 million dollars worked out to about $1 per poor person The $10 million dollars was a fine figure. According to the figures collected by the Citizens Board of Inquiry, [that] there are 10 million chronically hungry people in this country. That means that in an emergency situation, we are prepared to spend $1 per hungry person ] 6 to end hunger.
A rural poor person doesn't have much of a chance to receive what are laughingly called government handouts. In fact, only 18 1/2 per cent of all of the poor people in this country participated in any government food program in 1967. Where federal commodities are being distributed, families on welafre may find they are too rich to qualify; in a county where food stamps are sold, a welfare family may be too poor to buy the stamps.
But in the late ""60s, poor, rural black people are in danger of becoming expendable. If he was a they are farmers, mechanization, the use of chemicals instead of hoes, retaliatory measures aimed at stopping an increase in black voting strength, discrimination from federal agencies, all these forces combined to see he didn't stay a farmer long.
In 1964, only 7,000 black farmers in this country earned more than $2,500. In 1968, that figure had become smaller. ] 7
The non-farming rural black man suffered even more. If he was a farm worker who worked someone else's land, he found the land no longer needed his labor. Government programs conspired against him. For instance, in Sunflower County, Mississippi, 340 large landowners were paid $6 million dollars for not planting cotton; the poor black farm worker was paid with an eviction notice.
4
""The primary employer of black people in the rural areas has long been farming. But rarely has the black man been an employer. Beginning with the Homestead Act in 1862, the government programs designed to encourage family farms have discriminated against the Negro blacks. With the exception of one or two small land distribution efforts in South Carolina by the Freedman's Bureau, reform measures which were eventually cancelled (for the most part) by President Andrew Johnson, and a brief flurry of land reform undertaken by the New Deal, black people have never had the opportunity to own land in rural America. Today's Farmers Home Administration policies are not as blatantly anti-black as in the past, but a clause demanding ""demonstration of a past ability to repay"" when applied to a twenty-five thousand dollar farm loan, quickly eliminates tenants, sharecroppers, and day laborers who, though [??pping] experience, have a past history of making $3 a day. A policy such as this combined with FHA's county loan review committee system, which until recently was all white throughout the South, has effectively kept the black man landless, and there-
5
fore at the mercy of the landowner, the white man.
""It is ironic that agriculture, the basic purpose of the importation of black men and women into the colonies as slaves, now declares the black farm laborer and tenant to be ""surplus"" labor and the black farm owner ""ineffecient"". The statistical evidence of this is frightening. In 1964 the number of Negro farm operators (includes both owners and renters) had dwindled to 180,000. There are no figures for 1968, but it is reasonable to assume a further decrease. Only 1.3 per cent of ALL black farmers made $2500 or over in 1960. Black farmers' average age is over 50 years old; have an average number of years of schooling around 5.7; and only 7 per cent of adult Negro farm residents have completed high school.""
""What all the figures, facts, memos, papers, and statistics point to is the economic future of the black man in agriculture in this country rural America is bleak without a major land reform effort, and perhaps a revolution in how we think about efficiency. At present
6
our society prefers to pay the estimated $140,000 a male citizen can cost the public if he lives from 17 to 57 years of age on public assistance payments, rather than loan the same man $50,000 to purchase a business, a farm, a recreational area, or invest in stocks and bonds, for that matter. That it doesn't make sense, is beside the point.
""1968 saw an increase of ""surplus"" people and a decrease in the number of people receiving ""surplus"" food. In the rural South it was the year of the squeeze. The black man is no longer needed. And he is certainly no longer wanted by his former white owners or employers. Without a job, without an education — without training — without land and with little hope of getting any, without housing, health, or hope the black American depends upon whatever job he or she can get, whatever assistance private do-gooding groups can muster, and upon welfare.
No discussion of rural poverty can be complete without mentioning a great perpetrator of it, welfare policies. In Mississippi, Aid to Dependent Children (ADC) averages $8.50 a week per family; the maximum is $50 a month regardless of the number of children in the family. Many families are forced to live or, better, to try to live on this $50. It must pay for food, shelter, clothing, and heat, not to mention health
7
care or recreation or other unnecessary items—at times for eight persons. Mississippi, the same state whose Sunflower County got almost $7 million in crop diversion subsidies, turned down $20.7 million in federal welfare monies rather than put up $7.9 million in matching funds. While the rich get richer by putting people off their farms, the poor get told they are not worth one county's subsidy payment.
""Welfare helps clarify the situation poor people are in. Welfare for rural black Mississippians is enforced starvation, dislocation, desparation and hopelessness. Their situation is not the result of individual backwardness, cultural lag, or family breakdown. It is the deliberate governmental policies and economic strategies of this country that have created the poor person's dilemma. The same country which pays rich men not to grow food, supplies insufficient and unappetizing surplus foods to its poor men. The same federal agency which gives the J.G. Boswell Co. $4,091,000 in price support payments (subsidies) turns back to the Treasury $200 million of money that could have been used to aid the poor and hungry, because Congress members applied ""budgetary pressures"". In short, the United States has a purposely inadequate welfare system, administered for and by the priviledged. It is used to control the poor, not to alleviate their suffering.
""Rather than admit there is a basic maldistribution of property and wealth, it has been the custom in the United States
8
to put poverty into categories. We have the young poor, the old poor, the culture of poverty poor, the rural poor and the urban poor. It is a very neat way to do it. Instead of land or money, the poor are offered programs to improve their character or their children's educations. Not willing or able to say our institutions are incapable of meeting even the basic needs of people and therefore need to be radically altered, we look for panaceas and explanations. Recently, it has become fashionable to explain urban poverty as being the result of years of unattended rural poverty. The fact that the PEOPLE involved are useless to our high-powered economic machine, whether they are classified as rural or urban, is hidden nicely behind a big finger pointing at rural America saying (in good Blue [illegible]) ""The problem is there!"" The inability to  begin working on the myriad of urban problems, perhaps even an understandable human incapability to comprehend what it will take to rebuild the worst several blocks of Harlem (where the population density is so high that if all Americans were forced to live as jammed together all 200 million could be fitted into three of New York's five burroughs, leaving the other two and the rest of the United States totally unpopulated), the immensity of the task of stopping a machine out of control, makes the thought of building a decent society in rural America minor in comparison.
""And how will this rebuilding of rural America take place? As yet, there is no committment on the part of the federal
9
government to do it. It has avoided urban poverty by shifting the blame to supposed rural roots, and then deftly placed the burden of rebuilding upon the poor themselves. The final realization of the exploitive system of the United States is that its rich create the rural and urban slums and then ask the poor, through ""self-help"" to change them. Some poor black people in the urban slums are changing them, but not in an accepted fashion. Poor rural black people are, on the whole, still receptive to ""constructive"" methods of change. A variety of such efforts have taken place during the past year in the South.""
There is the beginning of a movement the co-op movement that offers some hope for the rural black poor.
There are several such Southern examples of coops. They all have failings of one sort or another; none are self supporting, all require some sort of subsidy. They have been successful, however, in keeping people, desparate people, together in a variety of' community organizations.
10
""An example is SWAFCA. In rural Alabama, 2000 poor black farmers are joined together in the Southwest Alabama Farmers Cooperative Association (SWAFCA). SWAFCA has been through a literal hell since its organization in the Spring of 1967. An OEO grant was vetoed by Governor Lurleen Wallace, but eventually overridden by the Director of OEO. The co-op was hardly in operation when, at the request of Alabama Congressmen, the General Accounting Office demanded its books. The delay held up a substantial part of its government grant. Just as the audit was completed, one of the federal audit officers had his brief case stolen, a theft which held up the audit for another month. As the co-op began marketing its members' cucumbers and okra, trucks carrying the produce were stopped and held long enough to insure crop damage before they were released. Within a month the FBI was
11
called in to investigate an alledged mis-use of funds. At about the same time Governor Brewer vetoed the second part of the demonstration grant, also overridden by OEO. When the second veto was pushed aside the governor and Mayor Smitherman of Selma obtained a circuit court injunction against the co-op charging mismanagement and misuse of public funds.
""What is SWAFCA to merit all this attention? A supplier of guns? A school for training men in guerilla warfare? No! SWAFCA is a supplier of fertilizer and a marketer of vegetables, a business owned and controlled by 2000 black men in the heart of racist Alabama. As a business SWAFCA lost money its first year of operation. As a political force, as a social force, as an organization with the ability of attracting over a million dollars worth of federal and private money to be spent by poor people for poor people, it is a qualified success. SWAFCA did a total of $172,000 worth of business, just a shade more than Senator Jim Eastland ""earned"" last year for not growing cotton on his plantation. That helps keep SWAFCA in perspective.
""There are eight or ten SWAFCA type cooperatives spread out over the South. Three co-ops are leasing land, attempting to buy a hundred or two acres with private money ([illegible]) and overall trying to reach the poorest of the rural poor. The other agricultural co-ops are presently only reaching the people with a sure hand on their land. In Alabama, a black man farming on white land soon
12
finds his belongings on the side of the road if he joins SWAFCA.
Efforts to begin small industries owned cooperatively by the workers are being made across the South. Handicraft cooperatives, sewing sub-contracting co-ops, bakeries, and candy co-ops provide some increase in their owners' incomes. Gasoline stations and bulk suppliers, grocery stores and buying clubs, credit unions and small finance companies, clothing and coal suppliers, fishing wholesalers, almost every type of business is being tried cooperatively. An effort to enable the many co-ops to come together and exercise their collective power is being made through the organization of the Federation of Southern Cooperatives, a service co-op owned by the some 45 different co-ops representing approximately 15,000 families.
""The co-op movement is weak, small, in many ways ineffectual in the face of hunger, dispair and disease. The lack of investment capital constantly hinders it from moving into areas it might possibly succeed in. Areas such as health insurance programs (with part of the premiums paid through grants from individuals and foundations), life insurance, burial services, land development, low-cost housing integrated with lumber cooperatives owned by small rural land-owners, trully specialized farms complete with green houses for force-growing, flower production, Community owned recreational facilities, restaurants, civic and social educational programs, day care centers, small industries in conjunction with small farming operations, large
17 13
farming operations fully mechanized with each member owning a small plot of their own on which to grow specialty crops while cattle graze in meadows owned cooperatively and government crop diversion checks pay the overhead and the interest on the loans, and you could go on and on—if you had the money.
""As 1968 came to an end, talk of a number of methods with which to end poverty—rural and urban—with one or two swift strokes became fashionable.  [Family allowances and some form of guaranteed annual income were endorsed by Ford Motor Company, Xerox, and IBM presidents.] Without some form of organization among poor people who will receive such an allowance if it ever becomes a reality, any form of subsidy payment to the poor will simply insure a greater degree of exploitation.
""Guaranteed annual income was not the only panacea offered in 1968. Talk of ""black capitalism"" tended to drown out discussion of hunger and inadequate housing, as well. It is disturbing to see the government shirk its responsibilities to its citizens by once again subsidizing profit making businesses to do its work. However, there is the feeling among conservatives as well as some radicals that ""big government"" has failed and with conservatives in power the resulting belief is that
14
private business could suceed in ending poverty. Inherent in this thinking is the need for non-governmental and decentralized decision making. The unhappy reality of America is that when government fails all that is left to turn to is private, profit making business. Therefore, the need for non-profit businesses and organizations, oriented to human needs rather than money (and more money) is critical.
""The present infatuation with black entrepreneurship is just the latest of a number of tries at involving money making people into community and social problems. In the past, on-the-job training with government paying private business to train poor people, was the thing. Tax incentives to industries if they will locate in a rural or urban slum, hire or train poor people, is the new plan. ""Turn key"" programs where corporations build plants, enjoy rapid amortization and tax breaks, and eventually turn the plant over to a community corporation have wide backing. To the extent such programs, when applied to rural situations, help solve the two most important problems of the rural poor—the lack of ownership of land and political power—they are welcomed. However, if black capitalism is simply an insurance policy big business is offering—five per cent offered so ninety-five per cent will not be burned down—to black profit making groups and individuals, the plan is detrimental.
We need rather community socialism, community control of land, community control of all the institutions, goods, services and resources that flow in and out of our community.
15
The ""year of rural poverty"" is over. The issues have been raised. Hunger, functional illiteracy, horribly inadequate educational programs, a million dilapidated houses, non-existence of health care, welfare programs which insure suffering (and control), subsidies for the rich but not the poor, discrimination in every program, agency, and department which is supposed to fight poverty. All these issues were brought out, discussed, assigned to committees, shelved, testified to, and forgot. Nothing really changed. It is naive to think because the rich and middle-class learned about such conditions existing within this country that things would change. This has never been the case. The only people poor people can possibly trust are poor people. A faint ray of hope or two is offered by the several organizations owned and controlled by poor people spread out over the rural South. Otherwise, there is little in which to place one's hope, unless it is the impossible possibility of 1969 being ""the year for people"" rather than profit.""
One ray of hope could be offered additionally by our young, those now engaged in restructuring the university. There is a task awaiting them. in the rural South They have energy, they have some idealism left, they have mobility and vitality their elders have lost. They can put starch in the Southern rural movement for they have [?age]. The rhetoric one hears from campus and street corner means little to a starving [man?] father or his children. That rhetoric must be made a reality; itf it is not, then we shall reap the whirlwind.
16
Finally, let us consider that the future may bring a new kind of movement to this country. Its beginnings can be seen already in rural Mississippi. They are the fruits of the 1964 drive by college students then to build an interracial people's movement.
That movement failed then. But it planted a seed, a seed left over from the old days of the populists under Tom Watson in Georgia, from the old days of the sharecropper's strike in Arkansas. A black Georgian, writing in 1884, made a prediction which may yet come true, and which ought to have some chilling significance for people like ourselves who come to meetings like this. He wrote:
17
....the future struggle in the South will be, not between white man and black man, but between capital and labor, landlord and tenant. The hour is approaching when the laboring classes of this country, North, East, West and South, will recognize they have a common cause, and a common enemy; and that therefore, if they would triumph over wrong and place the laurel wreath upon triumphant justice, without distinction of race or previous condition, they must unite. When the issue is properly joined, the rich, whether they be black or white, will be found on one side - and the poor, be they black or be they white, will be found on the other.1

Roosevelt, and last put into political effect with the election of John Fitzgerald Kennedy.
The demise of that old coalition has occurred concurrently with the rise of the black movement. As black demands have increased, the old coalition has begun to destroy itself, until in 1968, it finds itself totally unable to function.
The black sector of that old coalition, the sector most loyal, most faithful, the section that gave John F. Kennedy the difference between defeat and victory in 1960, that gave Lyndon B. Johnson [tk] 98% of their votes in 1964 and Hubert Humphrey a near 95% 90% in 1968, now will find itself in the next four years looking for a political movement to fit into.
The Kennedy years and the rise of [tk] student activism in this country run parallel. Four young black college students at a lunch counter in Greensboro, North Carolina on February 1st, 1960, set a tone for student militancy and student protest that has continued to escalate, and as that escalation has continued, so have the public demands of the total Black community.
One may quite readily assume that American blacks have always wanted the same things - full manhood rights, control of the institutions of our communities, participation in and control over the decision-making instruments that affect our lives.
That was true one hundred years ago when a black Georgia legislator, Henry McNeill Turner, on the eve of his expulsion from the Georgia legislature, warned the young men of Georgia to ""never lift a finger or raise a hand in defense of Georgia until Georgia acknowledges you are men, and invests you with the rights pertaining to manhood."" It is still true in 1968, when young black men are deciding that their enemies are less likely to be teen-age soldiers from the National Liberation Front but rather to be the men and women who make autocratic decisions about the necessity of opposing legitimate revolutions like that in Vietnam.
Even though the underlying goals of the black movement have always been the same, its stated goals have not; thus, in 1960, in the South, the goal of the movement that gave birth to student activism, north and south, was the integration of places of public accomodation, of lunch counters, busses, movie theatres, trains and tran stations. The movement was a movement demanding a piece of the existing action, a seat at the table.
That movement next began to demand that rural blacks be allowed to participate in their government, a demand that the United States under a liberal Democratic administration did not hasten to support, and precisely the same demand that the government of the United States has been resisting in Vietnam for several years.
When the movement became a political movement, when it began to mount challenges against established political forms, when it began to link the domestic colonialism of the ghetto with the foreign colonialism in Southeast Asia, when it began to move from the rural, black belt South where opposition was open and public into the urban North, when the opposition goes home to the suburbs every night, then the movement began to fall into dissaray. The tactics that worked in Selma, Alabama would not work in Cicero, Illinois. A nation that hated Jim Clark and Bull Connor sympathized with Mayor Daley. The two forces present in the black community since slavery - assimiliationsim and integrationism on one hand and separatism on the other - began to vie with each other openly, setting the stage for confusion, for public disagreements between black spokesmen, and for a general lAck of direction among the masses.
The debate about the inclusion of whites in the black movement and the susequent withdrawal of some whithes caused another period of hesitation.
Now the black movement is halted. It is split into one hundred different groups in one hundred different areas of the country. The day when CORE and SNCC and SCLC and the NAACP split up the South into areas of concern are gone, and for the most part, ought to have gone.
The day of the independent activists, the indigenous group is here. The day is coming when black people, despairing of waiting for action from Washington or for depending on a leader or a set of leaders, have decided to take matters into their own hands.
In the city of Atlanta, when black political power and black activism used to be in the hands of a small group of men, hundreds of groups and grassroots leaders have arisen. They are tired of the old ways, they are tired to decisions and deals made by the few for the many.
That phenomenon is being repeated everywhere in this nation - there is in fact, a revolution inside the black revolution, if what has happened in this nation from 1960 to the present can dare be called a revolution.
And so for the next several years black communities are likely to seethe, to boil and explode. Some black people will continue to be confortable, a as a great many are; the majority will suffer in poverty and oppression.
From the events of the last several years, from the diversity of movements and groups that now vie for leadership in the black community, ought to come a new sort of movement; there ought to be born a movement of the blacks, by the blacks and for the blacks that will find the ways and means to direct the energies of the total black community.
That does not mean that differening strategies must be abandoned. That does not mean that we require a central leader, but it does require that we in 1968 and beyond, begin to agree on a common set of principles.
These ought to include the following:
-that the social system, as we know it, is capable of reformism at best, and will change conditions for some black people but will leave to common condition of most blacks unchanged, or exactly the same.
-that the system then becomes part of the problem we deal with and cannot therefore be part of the solution.
-that black people must retain uppermost in their minds race consciousness, racial solidarity, and racial unity. We may seek to coalese, but only in honest, equal partnerships.
-that we must define, select and elect our own leaders, and not have anyone else choose them for us. Our leadership must be bold, brave, militant, and must have a base - a leadership without a followship is no leadership at all.
-finally, we must always put the race first put in perspective. We ought to remember the words of a great black man, W. E. B. DuBois, who wrote in 1953:
""I still think today as yesterday that the color line is the great problem of this century. But today I see more clearly that back of the problem of race and color, lies a greater problem which both obscures and implements it: and that is the fact that so many civilized persons are willing to live in comfort even if the price of this is poverty, ignorance and disease for [a] the majority of their fellowmen; that to maintain this priviledge men have waged war until today, war tends to become universal and continuous, and the excuse for this war continues largely to be color and race.""
So those black people who want radical, fundamental change in the system that decides who gets what from whom, the political system, and those white people who would join that struggle, have to decide on a course of action.
That course has got to include an escape from rhetoric and a turn toward action, an action that will make men whole, that will, in the words of Frnzn Fanon, who in writing a prescription for the future of the Third World, suggested a formula that might be apploed here:
""It is a question,"" he wrote, ""of the Third World starting a new history of man, a history which will have regard to the sometimes prodigious theses which Europe has put forward, but which will not forget Europe's crimes, of which the most horrible was created in the heart of man, and consisted of the pathological tearing apart of his functions and the crumbling away of his unity.
""There is no question of a return to nature. It is simply a very concrete question of not dragging men towards mutilation, of not imposing upon the brain rhythms which very quickly obliterate it and wreck it. The pretext of cathching up must nit be used to push man around, to tear him away from himself or from his privacy, to break and kill him.
""No, we do not want to catch up with anyone. What we want to do it go forawrd all the time, night and day, in the company of man, in the company of all men.
It will be difficult for black people, a people scorned by all people, to go forward in the company of all men. It will be difficult for those who have been tricked by politics - or for those who made this past year a few months experiment in politics - to seek political solutions to their common problem.
It will be difficult to organize in a land ruled by men with no concern for human liberties. It will be difficult for a movement that assumes the supporters of George Wallace are pigs to seek alliances with pigs, or even to propose a solution to their problems. [The previous deletion was done in blue ink on the typed page.]
It will be difficult. If it is not done, if change does not come, if blood does flow even deeper in the streets, then blame alone cannot fall on the pigs or the new colonialists or the domestic imeprialists - it must fall also on those who spoke for change on street corners but did nothing else; on those who seized a university administration building but would not seize the county welfare office; on those who curse liberal democrats but would not work to build an alternative.
As Frederick Douglas once said:
""Who would be free, themselves must strike the blow. Men will combine to prevent cruelty to animals for they are dumb and cannot speak for themselves, but we are men and must speak for ourselves or we will not be spoken for at all. The man outraged is the man to make the outcry. We hold it to be self evident that no class or color should be the exclusive rulers of this country. If there is such a ruling class, there must of course be a subject class, and when this condition is established, the Government of the people, by the people and for the people will have perished from the earth."" [In the quoted material, the first three typed sentences are circled in blue ink.]
That is the choice - rulers or subjects, exist or perish.
-30-
[The following is handwritten in blue ink.]
We have got to do it ourselves
- college students, black + white, won't do it
- money that used to come down from North isn't coming any more
- SNCC won't do it; CORE won't do it

It is a pleasure to speak on behalf of a group of professional people who are stopping out of the mold that usually characterizes middle class, middle minded people: you have agreed to use your talents and your skills to help your fellow man.
And you have done so in your chosen profession, the profession which deals most directly with the health problems of poor black people.
It may be argued that jobs, housing and education are more pressing for poor people, but no one can argue that without good health, no one can hold a job, run a household, go to school or effectively function in society.
That health is a pressing problem for the poor is easily shown:
- death comes earlier to the poor. Life expectancy for non-whites is 7 years less than for whites.
- non-white mothers die in childbirth 4 times as often as do white mothers. Infant mortality is twice as high among non-whites as whites.
- illness is twice as frequent among families classified as poor. Tuberculosis is found twice as frequently among non-white urban residents as among whites.
- visits to doctors and dentists are less frequent among the poor, despite their obvious need for medical care.
2
The many federal programs, while providing help for some few have failed to help the many. Fewer than 9 million poor people are able to take advantage of Medicaid, leaving more than 30 million unable to afford medical care.
Although hunger and malnutrition are recognized as the greatest contributor to the poor health of the poor, only about 8 million poor people actually receive food assistance through food stamps and distribution of commodities, and even the federally distributed commodities themselves constitute an inadequate diet.
The private practitioners of medicine have a real responsibility to help improve medical care. This responsibility includes locating offices accessible to the poor, it includes limiting or eliminating the high costs which deny medical care to so many.
But private efforts, despite the recent emphasis on voluntary efforts coming from Washington, will always leave a great deal to be desired. The day must come when government insures that every person has guaranteed medical and dental care, and that every person in need has a hospital bed.
That day is not likely to come soon, particularly if present trends continue.
The kinds of health problems which are shared by all poor people, but particularly by poor black people, are not likely to disappear if present day conditions continue as they are
That is because there are many battles still to be fought and won.
Most pressing for Southern black people in the fight to retain and strengthen the 1965 Voting Rights Act. This Act will expire in August 1969. Under this Act, thousands of black people in the South have registered to vote. Charles Evers would not be Mayor of Fayette, Mississippi, without the 1965 Voting Rights Act. There would not be 14 black state representatives in Georgia without the 1965 Voting Rights Act. There would not be nearly 400 elected black officials in the South without that Act.
That Act needs to be extended for ten more years, and it needs to be strengthened, or the minimal amounts of progress we have made in the South will disappear.
There is another battle which needs to be fought now. The United States Congress is trying now the restrict the giving potential of the great foundations, the foundations which have helped to support black education in the South; the foundations which have helped to support voter registration and education drives in the South.
That battle has to be fought.
Another battle which has to be fought in Congress is the battle to halt welfare programs for rich people. This must be the only country in the world which runs its economy on capitalism
4
for poor people and socialism for rich people.
We annually spend for money on pet food more than we do on food stamps. We pour vast federal subsidies into the oil industry and the cotton industry. We gave gentlemen farmer Senator James O. Eastland $140,000 in farm subsidies, in effect paying him for doing nothing. But no one says that Eastland is lazy, and shiftless and a welfare bum. Some weeks ago, the United States House of Representatives voted to place a $20,000 limit on the amount of money a farmer could receive for doing nothing: when will they begin to think about paying $20,000 a year to families, the poor and the black, who cannot do for themselves.
Black people are seeing a real wave of racism sweeping the country. The elections last year in Los Angelos, Milwaukee and New York have clearly demonstrated that race is not an issue in Southern politics alone, but that it is an issue and will be an issue in every municipal and county and state election for some time in the future. In 19701 there will be an opportunity to replace some of the worst racists and military merchants in Congress. Some of our larger American cities are turning black; we will have the opportunity to put decent men in Mayors' chairs all over this nation, but only if we get ourselves together.
5
There are other attacks being made on us. The Federal government and the little tyrant who runs the FBI have given notice they believe they can with impunity listen in on the conversation of anyone in the United States. Just two weeks ago, they admitted the planted bugs in the telephone, the living room and the automobile of one of our religious leaders, the Honorable Elijah Muhammad. They admitted they bugged the conversations and hotel rooms of the late Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. They next time you call eomeone, or have a conversation with someone that you think is private, ask yourself whether Attorney General Mitchell and J. Edgar Hoover are listening in.
Over the last few weeks, we have seen a series of vicious and well coordinated attacks made by local policement and the FBI on the Black Panther Party, one of the vanguard organizations in the black liberation struggle. Their leaders have been arrested, their offices ransacked. You may not care what happens to the Black Panthers, although you should, but if you don't speak out when the Panthers are attacked, ask yourself, who will speak out for you?
8
revenge.
""The educated and wealthy class of white people despise the Negro, because they have robbed him of his earnings, or at least have got rich off the fruits of his labor....The lowest class hate him because he is poor, as they are....
""I do not regard this as a time of darkness. The war that has been waged against us for two centuries has opened our eyes, and caused us to form alliances, so that instead of acting on the defensive, we are ready to attack the enemy. This is simply a change of tactics, but I think I see the work of God in all this. Yes, there is the handwriting on the wall: I come not to bring peace, but a sword. Break every yoke, and let the oppressed go free. I have heard the groans of my people, and am come down to deliver them....
""White Americans have taken great pains to prove that we are cowards. We are often insulted with the assertion that if we had the courage of Indians or white men, we should never have submitted to be slaves.
""The courage of the Anglo-Saxon is best shown in his treatment of the Negro. A score of them will pounce on a Negro, tie him up, best him, and call him a coward because he resists. Many 
9
of their most brilliant victories have been achieved in this manner. But the greatest battles they have fought have been on paper. White men have no room to taunt us with tamely submitting. If they were black men they say, they would work wonders, but as white men, they can do nothing. Consistency, thou art a jewel.
""I would have you understand that I not only love my race, but I love my color, and while many colored persons may feel degraded by being called Negroes, I shall feel it my duty, my pleasure and my pride to concentrate my feeble efforts in elevating to a fair position this race to which I am especially tied by feeling and by blood.
""The prejudice which some white/men have against my color gives me no pain. If any man does not fancy my color, that is his business, and I shall not meddle with it. I shall/give myself no trouble because he lacks good taste. I will not deny that I do admire the talent and character of many white men, but I cannot say I am particularly pleased with their physical appearance. If old Mother Nature had held out as well as she began, we should probably have had fewer varieties among the races.
When I contrast the fine, tough, muscular system; the beautiful rich color; the full broad features and the gracefully frizzled
10
hair of the Negro, with the delicate physical organization, the wan and washed out color, the sharp features, the lank hair and delicate physical condition of the Caucasian, I am inclined to believe that when the white man was created, Mother Nature was pretty well exhausted---but determined to keep up appearances, she pinched up his features and did the best she could under the circumstances.""

1970 NATIONAL HEALTH FORUM SPEECH
By Julian Bond
FILE
It is fashionable these days to declare that this country is in the throes of a health care crisis. President Nixon has made such a ] declaration, as has former HEW Secretary Finch. So have the Urban Coalition and Fortune Magazine. But, as with so many other vital national issues, the leadership of this country seems quite ready to declare a crisis and quite unprepared or unwilling to do anything meaningful about it. The President's proposed health budget for the next this fiscal year, for example, reflects no concern for the impending ""breakdown in our medical care system"" of which he warned. Once again the war, the defense complex, and the battle against inflation have taken their toll domestically. Those with an interest in good health care cannot sit idle in this fight over national priorities.
Yet something else, something perhaps equally fundamental ought to bothers me us about the recent concern in high places over the state of health care in America. It is a concern which seems largely to have been stimulated by and directed at manifestations
2.
of the core ] 5 problems rather ] 5 than the problems themselves. A tremor of shock ran through the American health establishment when it was confronted with data revealing that the United States ranked behind thirteen countries in infant mortality rate, behind eleven countries in maternal mortality rate, behind seventeen countries in male life expectancy, and behind ten countries in female life expectancy — Americans do not like to finish less than first in anything. Even greater furore has been raised by continual revelations of figures showing shocking rises in the costs of health care, a phenomenon many attribute to poor management of health care institutions and inefficient organization and distribution of health care resources — Americans are traditionally not tolerant of inefficiencies of any kind. But distressing though these rates and figures may be, they are merely symptoms of much broader and deeper problems, human ] 6 problems, which must be understood in human terms from the point of view of the consumer of health care.
3.
[illegible]
When two southern conservative doctors introduced a resolution at the last a recent ANA convention to have health care declared a privilege and not a right, they were derided by the liberal health establishment. Didn't they know that by pronouncement of Congress and the President all Americans have a right to health care? Well, somebody should have asked the American health care consumer. He would have told those conservative doctors that they need not have introduced their resolution, for it merely describes the existing health care system, the system with which he, the consumer, must daily cope.
A privilege, yes. Indeed, as the consumer has well learned, a privilege to be dispensed only at the whim and convenience of the providers of care. For he, the consumer especially if he is black must seek his care from alien institutions, which were not truly set up to serve him, and which need not respond to his wants or needs. Visits ] 7 to doctors or hospitals are, generally at a place and during 
4.
hours convenient to them, not him, and many of those doctors and hospitals would just aswell do without his patronage if he is unhappy with their service. Insurance companies write policies which serve their needs, not his, and he is powerless to complain. Drug companies develop and manufacture medicines to suit their own purposes and convince doctors to prescribe those medicines by questionable means, leaving him to accept the value of the prescription on faith hoping it is worth its exorbitant price and or at least that it will do him no harm.
This catalog of self-serving health institutions and the self-serving brand of care they deliver could go on. But the impact of this system of ""health care"" on Americans of all walks of life can ] 8 best be seen by examining with some specificity the problems confronting persons seeking health services. I [illegible] Let me undertake a description of some of these problems, drawing on the field experiences of the Citizens Board of ] 8 Inquiry into Health Services for Americans.
5.
If a consumer happens to live somewhere in rural America, he [illegible] faces special obstacles when he seeks to secure health services for himself or his family. He need not be black or even poor to live in one of the 116 counties throughout the country with no doctor, or in one of the 164 counties with only one doctor, or in one of the hundreds of other counties with no more than a handful of doctors. A trip for medical care may be many miles over poor, and sometimes impassable, roads. At best, such a trip will mean substantial time away from work and a consequential loss of income; at worst, the length of the trip may be the difference between life and death. And, no one knows how many die because the burden of seeking care is so great that they ] 9 postpone a visit to the doctor until it is too late? These obstacles to getting care are often compounded for the rural poor who may have no car, no phone, or no one to take care of the kids. ] 9
And what quality of care rewards those hearty enough to
6.
brave the trip to the country doctor's office? A rural consumer is in little position to be choosey. He accepts as his own, because he must, whatever doctor happens to settle in his locality. That doctor might be highly skilled, mediocre, or incompent; he might be dedicated or lazy, kindly or sadistic, generous or prone to take advantage of his dominant position. And, the position of a rural physician is one of dominance, with the consumer completely dependent on that physician's skill, judgement, and personality. A dominance which, not surprisingly, many rural doctors do exploit. In one Southern, rural community, field workers from the Citizens ] 10 Board of Inquiry documented all of the following forms of exploitation by local doctors:They found Iit was a common practice to charge patients a full fee, payable in advance, and then not to perform any services in return, even when ] 10 services were obviously needed, but instead to slough send the patient off with a shot or a prescription, leaving the patient to get better by the will of God or
7.
a home remedy, or to die, or to return for another meaningless appointment, or somehow to seek the aid of another doctor whose methods of practice may or may not be different;
(2)They found that Ppatients were regularly given unnecessary shots for which an extra fee was always exacted; (3) Doctors abused a state-licensed procedure for the delivery of babies by midwives by only certifying cases as safe for such delivery when the patients could not afford to have their babies delivered by a doctor; (4) Doctors turned ] 11 the free drug samples given to them by drug company detail men over to local pharmacies for credit on their own accounts, thus depriving patients of a source of free medicine.
Other forms of exploitations are common in rural areas. In some ] 11 places unnecessary operations including sterilization are a regular occurrence. Rural doctors often own the local pharmacy or receive kickbacks from the local pharmacist and write prescriptions accordingly. Even without such conflicts of interest, the rural pharmacist is generally able to exploit his own dominant position
8.
and charge prices for drugs far above those charged in urban areas.
Where racial or ethnic minorities are present, another incident of the providers' dominance invariably appears: invidious discrimination in the provisions of health services. Such discrimination may be manifest in longer waits in the outer office, discourteous treatment, ] 12 inadequate treatment, or the absolute refusal to render services; but its force and impact can perhaps best be understood if we imagine ourselves as a black mother who must depend for the health of herself and her children on the services of a doctor who is a member of the Klan or a leader of the local White Citizens Council. ] 12
This is not to cloak all rural health providers in the garb of evil. But should a rural such a doctor be skilled, conscientious, and dedicated, he likely will be called upon to treat sixty, seventy, or eighty patients a day. If he takes an evening or a day off, the residents of his
9.
locality may be left without access to medical care. The pressure on the doctor is constant; the time with each patient necessarily short. What kind of care can consumers be getting under these circumstances? The consumer cannot win in our system of rural health care.
And yet, the rural consumer must pay and pay well for what he gets. The rural doctor depends for his livelihood on the firm establishment of a fee-for-service system. His patients are his payment mechanism, and he must ensure the stability of this mechanism by always demanding payment in advance or by a very tight credit policy. Thus, the all too frequent phenomenon of patients in dire need being refused service for lack of cash in hand — have we not tolerated too long a health care system which condones the turning away of mothers about to give birth because they ] 13 lack the money to pay the doctor fee?
And what of the other pernicious consequences of a health system which requires financial resources for entry?
10. 
People are paying for medical care instead of food, or instead of clothes necessary to send their kids to school. People are working when they should be resting and recuperating, or are working at jobs detrimental to ] 14 their health, in order to pay off medical bills. How do we justify a health care system which in fact breeds bad health?
I have dwelt upon the problems of the rural health consumer because they illustrate in the starkest manner the problems of all health consumers. Urban consumers, both poor and middle class but especially blacks are also the victims of dominant providers, but for them the system is more complex and the dominance more subtle. Suffice it, for this audience, merely to say that notions of consumer control through the market mechanism are at best disingenuous, and that no meaningful representation of consumer interests is provided by third-party payment mechanisms or by government regulation. This system leaves the low income urban consumer at
11.
the mercy of providers who locate hospitals and other medical facilities across town from him out of concern for the convenience of doctors or medical students; who set the hours of service at times best suited for the medical staff though often inconvenient for him; who set as low priorities the improving of the depressing atmosphere of emergency rooms and outpatient clinics, the shortening of the often hours long wait for outpatient care, the hiring of interpreters for ] 15 foreign language speaking minorities, and the changing of hospital procedures and staff attitudes which deprive the patients of dignity and privacy; and at the mercy of providers who have established a system of medical education which selects as doctors those with the least understanding of and empathy for the lives and feelings of the urban poor.
This system leaves the urban middle class consumer at the mercy of insurance companies which decide it is not worth their while to police hospital and physician costs
[12.]
and so provide him even decreasing coverage for ever increasing premiums, and at the mercy of insurance plans which ] 15 force him into the hospital, causing him to lose income, for care which he could receive on an outpatient basis.
I have made no attempt to deal exhaustively with the entire range of consumer health care problems; rather, I have tried to stress the link, increasingly apparent to consumers and consumer groups, between ] consumer problems and the inability of consumers to protect themselves within the present system. Despite all the money and manpower this country pours into its ""health care system,"" — over $60 billion a year — the output of that system as far as the consumer is concerned is both meager and oppressive: he has trouble getting care when he needs it; the care he gets is all too likely to be inadequate, and he has no way of judging its adequacy; and yet he must pay dearly for whatever he gets. This indeed is a health care system in crisis. But I submit that the crisis is not one of inefficiency. Too many Hhealth 
13.
institutions are working only too well in the service of their own interests. There is only inefficiency if we mistakenly assume that the ultimate object of these institutions is to deliver good health care; in fact, the health care that is delivered is but a by-product of the system.
I feel constrained here to comment briefly on some of the ] 17 reforms that have recently been proposed, because I fear deeply the danger that these reforms will simply serve to reinforce the misdirection in the system which I have described above. A recent issue of Fortune Magazine was devoted largely to a description of current health care problems and an evaluation of possible solutions. Throughout this series of articles ran a very disturbing theme: that the provision of health services is a growth industry, almost entirely free from the controls of the market place -- an industry ripe for exploitation by enterprising corporations. But the road to solution would not 
[Page 14 appears out of order, below.] 
15.
[The following content is crossed out with one large X over the paragraph as a whole.]
arrogated to themselves, largely through myths acquiesced in by the consumer, the role of representing the interests of consumers as well as the interests of providers, though the two sets of interests are often in conflict? A system of paternalism which even today is reinforced by many well meaning health professionals who say to the consumer: ""Tell us your problems, and we will work out the solutions.""
No more basic reform is needed than that the health care system devote its energies solely to implementing the right of decent health care for all. Reform of this nature can not and should not come from within the present health establishment. If health care is truly to be a right, the interests of the consumer must be overriding in the system, and health care institutions must be structured to respond to those interests.

[This page appears in different typeset than the previous pages.]
You gentlemen and ladies are expected to be — and are susposed to be — different from the horrible examples I have described. Because you ] 19 come from — and will practice in — communities where health care has always been measured out in tablespoons by the powerful and affluent, you have been expecially sensitive to the problems I have described.
But you have an additional responsibility. You will shortly represent one of ] 19 the most affluent groups of black people in the United States. You are respected and looked up to in your communities. You must use this affluence to help support those institutions that will make our community a more viable place to live. You must speak out against our common enemies, and speak in favor of our common goals.
You must use your influence to build a stronger feeling of race consciousness in our communities, a consciousness that cannot help but help you. Each of you is familiar with the sorry feeling by too many black people that the white man's ice is colder, his sugar sweeter, and his medecine stronger.
For example, you, like others, must face up to the demands that spring from the black community.
6
[The following content is crossed out with one large X over the page as a whole.]
And when our young people return to college this fall, armed as they will be with the determination that their education, unlike yours and mine, will be truly meaningful to them and to the black community, will you speak out in favor of decent, relevant education for black children, or will you continue to let others set your standards for you?
And while Senator Thurmond, the Cinderella bridegroom from South Carolina, continues to subvert school education in the South, we must continue to fight that battle as well.
While the President of the United States and the puppet dictator of South Vietnam still continue to deny freedom of choice to the people of Southeast Asia, and while this government squanders money on the ABM (America's Biggest Mistake), we must continue to demand that men on earth receive equal treatment with men on the moon, and that there are 25 million poor people here who demand that a war be fought at home, with just as much vigor and money as the war against people in Southeast Asia.
And when serious demands are made by serious people on some of the wealthiest financial institutions in the United States, the religious establishment, we have to fight that battle too. Don't let anyone tell you that the money will beuused to line someone's pocket; we are demanding reparations to the tune of $15 
7
a nigger, reparations to build a Southern land bank, to build a black publishing, house, to help finance education for black professionals, for the National Welfare Rights Organization. That battle must be fought as well, and when it is one, then American business must face tour demands too.
You ought to face up to that demand. It is a right one, it is a just one, it is a proper one. Just remember, if you have any fondness forreligious interests in this country, that it was the Christian church that brought your ancestors here to civilise them, and that when the church came to Africa, we had the land and they had the Bible. Now all we have is the Bible.
Let me leave you with a selection from two speeches delivered long ago by a black doctor man of medecine, a strong man with a tongue as sharp as his scalpel. His name was Dr. John S. Rock, and what he had to say over 100 years ago still has a great deal to say to us in 1969 1971: If you can make your action match his rhetoric then black ] 20 people's healthcare problems will be closer to solution.
""I am here not so much as to make a speech but to add color to this occasion.... The situation of the black man in this country is far from being an enviable one. Today, our heads are in the lion's mouth, and we must get them out the best way we can. It is probable that if we had the malice of the Anglo-Saxon, we would watch our first chance and seize an opportunity to take our

seem by way of additional exploiters. I am also disturbed by some of the proposals for a national health insurance scheme which seem resigned to simply pouring more money into the present malfunctioning system and hoping this money will trickle down in the form of increased benefits for consumers. ] 18Even more dubious is the AMA tax credit scheme which is in fact designed to ensure the preservation of the present health care system.
A word about the much maligned AMA is pertinent here. I have often wondered whether liberal criticism of that organization has not somehow missed the mark. Why should we expect the AMA and other health professional associations to act differently from other trade associations or unions? We are not surprised or particularly critical when unions advocate policies which rebound to the interest of their members though not necessarily to the interest of the general public. Should not the criticism be directed instead at the way health provider organizations ] 18 have

of their most brillianvvictories have been achieved in this manner. But the greatest battles they have fought have been on paper. White men have no room to taunt us with tamely submitting.

""I would have you understand that I not only love my race, but ] 22 I love my color, and while many colored persons may feel degraded by being called Negroes, I shall feel it my duty, my pleasure and my pride to concentrate my feeble efforts in elevating to a fair position this race to which I am especially tied by feeling and by blood.
""The prejudices which some whitemen have against my color gives me no pain. If any man does not fancy my color, that is his business, and I shall not meddle with it. I shall give myself no trouble because he lacks good taste. I will not deny that I do admire the talent and ] character of many white men, but I cannot say I am particularly pleased with their physical appearance. If old Mother Nature had held out as well as she began, we should probably have had fewer varieties among the races.
When I contrast the fine, tough, muscular system, the beautiful rich color, the full broad features and the gracefully frizzled
10
hair of the Negro, with the delicate physical organization, the wan and washed out color, the sharp features, the lank hair and delicate physical condition of the Caucasian, I am inclined to believe that when the white man was created, Mother Nature was pretty well exhausted---but determined to keep up appearances, she pinched up his features and did the best she could under the circumstances.""

""America's malaise"" they said, -- which all of us feel in one way or another -- has its roots in the distance between national ideal and national reality.""
""Our ideal is a country where every American gets an equal chance to perform, where jobs exist for everyone who wants one, where health care and personal safety are assured, where we live in harmony with each other and have a decent place to live."" 
""Our reality needs no full recital here. We know that cities are in trouble, that poverty continues in the midst of wealth, that unemployment is high, that malnutrition is widespread, that injustice exists, that tensions endure. In sum, we know that our society is 
2
not functioning the way it is supposed to."" 
""But if we solve the greatest of our ills"" the Coalition said, ""our paralysis of spirit and will, we can narrow the distance between what we have and what we want. Indeed, we must marshal our good sense and our good will. There is no sensible alternative."" 
In the Coalition view ""America must pursue several major goals between now and 1976. It must try to: 
""Achieve full employment with a high level of economic growth - all of our other policy goals depend upon it.
""Provide all citizens with an equal opportunity to participate in American society and in the shaping of governmental decisions affecting their lives.
""Guarantee that no American will go without the basic necessities: food, shelter, health care, a healthy environment, personal safety, and an adequate income. 
3
""Meet our obligations to assist in the economic development of the world's lesser developed nations.
""These are the goals. We can move a long way toward them by 1976.""*
But in addition to the Coalition's major goals and their definition of ""paralysis of will"" as the greatest of our ills, there is another goal much more desirable and another ill much more horrible. The ill is racism and the goal its containment and eradication. 
Everyone knows, or ought to know, that there is one consuming problem that makes life in New York's Harlem, Cleveland's Hough, Los Angeles' Watts or Atlanta's Vine City, or any of America's other urban Atticas - where some men are held in bondage by some other men - both intolerable and insufferable. 
That problem is race. It is race that elected our present President in 1968; race that makes some Americans serve and die more 
4
readily than others in Vietman; race that makes some children more educated than others; race that colors all of our lives. 
For the past several years solutions to the problem of race, and thus to the pathologies of society that spring from it, have been more than abundant. 
There are several solutions that, if implemented, would begin to make this country a proper place for men and women to live and work and a healthy place for our children to play and grow and learn. 
The nation can adopt, and strive for, a policy of full employment. 
Equal opportunity, both racially and sexually, can top being the rhetoric of campaigns and platforms and become the reality of the present. 
Through public service employment, increased economic growth, increases in wage minimums and in minimum wage coverage, and in guaranteeing social insurance by radically altering public assistance, 
5
every American can be guaranteed an income. 
The institution of a national health insurance program and a radical alteration of federal housing programs will additionally aid in making both urban and rural America more attractive places to live.
None of these things will be done, however, unless there is increased interest among the people who desire them in politics; unless there is a growth in political activism coalition and organization between now and November, 1972. 
This is a drive that must spring from a careful calculation of what is at stake and what the issues may be. 
For too many Americans, an exchange of presidents is nothing more than an exchange of photographs on the post office wall or a dormitory dart board; for Black Americans, the issue is whether we progress, run in place, or continue to slide backward as we have been doing since 1968. 
6
The purpose then for which politically minded people must organize now is to influence the selection. Nomination and election of a new President, Vice-President and Congress in 1972.
On one level, the choice for the top office is simple: anyone beside the incumbent will do.
On another, higher level, the nominee must be someone who delivers reality not rhetoric to the Black community, and who has some responsibility to that community.
It must be someone who will put teeth into the demands for a decent life, someone who will provide jobs and a chance at life. 
Since the present President took office, we have spent billions and more on war and now are on the brink of W.W.III, over two million more Americans have been added to the ranks of the unemployed, 2.5 million more are on ever-mounting relief rolls, inflation has reduced our standard of living, many American 
7
cities face bankruptcy. The racist policies of public and private U.S. institutions continue tq insure that Blacks and other oppressed peoples will suffer more than others, in good times and in bad. 
The selection of a Vice-President is less important, and must be considered only because that person could become President. It ought not be considered as a real achievement to have a Black or female or Jewish or Southern Vice-President, or a Vice-President who happens to be all four. Whoever it is will do what the President says must be done. 
A new Congress will be chosen in 1972 also. There must for the most part be new men and women, not the tired old faces of the past. It must be a Congress that would reject the family destruction plan, that would have said no to Lockheed, would have said no to more war, no to freezes on wages with no freezes on profits, no to Reagan-Feller 
8
repression in America's concentration camps, no to J. Edgar Hoover's Federal Bureau of Intimidation, no to military millions for 20th century imperialism, no to Nixonomics and Mitchell's mixups, no to the systematic destruction of Black people, our homes, our few jobs, our children, our very lives. 
This seemingly magical transformation can be begun.
It is not too soon to begin now. In fact, it is really too late. The process is difficult and easy at the same time. It involves involving yourself in politics, my profession, the second oldest profession in the world.
Your first difficulty will be dealing with those who will tell you that politics is useless and accomplishes nothing. These are, incidentally, the same people who in 1968 would have told you that George Wallace's election would be a good thing, because it would 
9
""heighten the contradictions"" and therefore hasten the revolution. That's fine in campus revolutionary theory, but it's Black peoples' contradictions that are being heightened, not theirs. These are the spiritual descendants of the same people who in Germany in the 1930s urged the election of Adolph Hitler for the same reason. 
Politics is not the art of the possible, as you may have been taught in high school Civics, or even the art of the compromise. As you may have learned in Poly. Sci. 101, but a much more serious art: the art of seeing who gets how much of what from whom. 
We, of course, are the who who haven't gotten any of anything from you know who. 
These can be no denying then that the direction Black and poor people must take in the remainder of the 1970s is toward a real and meaningful participation in a new politics. 
That is because it is politics that decides, in the end, what 
10
kind of life each of us will have, what kind of world we live in, what kind of futures our children will have. 
It is politics that sent our sons and brothers and uncles and fathers to Southeast Asia, to shoot and kill and be killed by other mothers' sons in a war made by politicians; it is politics that will bring them back. 
It is politics that decides that unemployment for Black people will remain at two and three times the national average, and it is politics that decides that we will live in a permanent depression. And it is politics that can put money in our pockets and give us jobs or a livable, not laughable, income now. 
It is politics that decides that we must live in second and third hand homes that others have discarded or in vertical prisons of concrete and glass designed by some architect who lives in the suburbs. It is politics that made it impossible for so many of us to 
11
earn a living down home, and ran us into the cities to be squeezed together like sardines in a can. And it is politics that will enable us to take over some of the cities where we live, and turn them into the kinds of places where everyone wants to live and raise their children. 
It is politics that gives our children lead poisoning, and it is politics that has created socialism for Lockheed Aircraft and welfare capitalism for the poor.
It is politics that makes us the last to be hired and the first to be fired; that gives our children twelve years of school but only six years of education; that has made us first in war on the battlefield, but last in peace, and seldom in the hearts of our countrymen. 
But the kind of politics that has done these things to us is not the kind of politics that we must play; our politics must be different and new. 
12
What we must strive for, with or without that vanishing American species, people of good will, is to put ourselves in a position to enforce the demand that the political party that received 98% of our automatic support in 1964 and 1968 demonstrate its gratitude by returning to us jobs, housing, funds and decision-making in direct proportion to our percentage of their total vote - over 20% in 1968.
We have got to stop being the illegitimate child at the family reunion, waiting in the kitchen while the family members - the military/labor complex, the politically promiscuous white South, the corrupt big city machines, the respectable friends of organized crime - divide the gravy. 
This cannot be achieved by endorsing candidate X or Y before the convention or by having Black delegates in Miami Beach who are Black only through an accident of their birth, and who must ask their white 
13
bosses before they are allowed to shuffle away.
It could be begun by seeing that whoever represents you when the Democrats choose their Presidential candidates is someone who has an allegiance to issues, to withholding his or her vote until the candidate comes along who pledges to make good on 30 years of rhetoric. 
It requires delicate balance between two competing impulses; first, to defeat Richard Nixon and, next, the strong desire not to continue to be the last unrewarded Democrats in America. 
The election choice in November of 1972 will be between the 2 Anglo-Saxon men, in their 50s or older.
The chances for a successful alternative party being built between now and November 1972 are less than slim. 
One of these two men will be named Richard Nixon; the other could be anyone, if only you can help insure it is the right anyone. 
14
You can tell this ""anyone"" he can have your support if he comes your way to get it. 
If there is one here who believes it makes no difference who is President in this country ask yourself these questions: 
Who nominated Carswell and Haynesworth to the Supreme Court, then put the Minnesota Twins there? 
Who made John Mitchell the Attorney General of the United States? 
Whose Department of Injustice tolerates murder at Attica, San Quentin, at Jackson State, at Orangeburg, at Kent State? 
Who gave the Cinderella Bridegroom from South Carolina, Strom Thurmond, veto power over judicial appointees and school integration decisions? 
Whose Secretary of Defense says that the war against the Vietnamese people may end but American soldiers will be in Vietnam for many years to come? 
15
Who is afraid of the Hillbilly Hitler from Alabama? 
Who was it who made the gate-mouthed Maryland farmer the Vice President of the United States?
Who was that man? 
And who were the people who let him do these things? With some exceptions, it was the Congress of the United States, the Representatives whose terms expire every two years, and the Senators whose terms expire every six years. 
You should check yours out. They may be perfect men. If they are not don't just check them out, kick them out.
In 1968, out of a voting population of 120 million people, only 73 million voted. Richard Nixon received 31 million votes, but half again as many people, 47 million, did not vote at all. 
These figures could be reversed, and the architects of the Southern strategy retired. 
16
This will never be done, however, until we develop the ability to do more than just talk about our politics. We must develop the ability to punish our enemies and reward our friends. Remembering that the allies of today may be the antagonists of tomorrow. 
We have to free our politics from dependence on outside planning and outside funding.

Remember, if you undertake this task, some words from the past, from the great abolitionist Frederick Douglass, who said: 
""If there is no struggle, there is no progress. Those who profess to favor freedom and yet deprecate agitation are men who want crops without plowing up the ground. They want the rain without thunder and lightning. They want the ocean without the awful roar of her mighty waters. The struggle may be a physical one, and it may be a moral one.

For example, agricultural subsidies could be cut by $1.2 billion, while rural residents could be provided with expanded rural non-farm job opportunities.
Federal highway subsidies could be reduced by $1 billion a year, with the funds applied to the urgent need of mass transit.
Other funds are obtainable by reducing expenditures from the Army Corps of Engineers (currently $1.4 billion) and Merchant Marine subsidies ($330) billion), and most importantly a cut in military spending of $30 billion by immediately withdrawing all advisors and military personnel from all of Southeast Asia.

It must be a Congress that would reject the family destruction plan, that would have said no to Lockheed, would have said no to more war, no to the continuation of starving children eating lead for dinner, no to freezes on wages with no freezes on profits, no to Reagan-Feller repression in America's concentration camps, no to J. Edgar Hoover's Federal Bureau of Intimidation, no to military millions for 20th century imperialism, no to Nixonomics and Mitchell's mixups, no to the systematic destruction of Black people, our homes, our few jobs, our children, our very lives.
This seemingly magical transformation can be achieved begun. 
It is not too soon to begin now. In fact, it is nearly too late. The process is difficult and easy at the same time. It involves
10
involving yourself in politics, my profession, the second oldest profession in the world.
Your first difficulty will be dealing with those who will tell you that politics is useless and accomplishes nothing. These are, incidentally, the same people who in 1968 would have told you that Richard Nixon's George Wallace's election was would be a good thing, because it would ] 9 "" heighten "" the contradictions and therefore hasten the revolution. That's fine in campus revolutionary theory, but it's Black people's contradictions that are being heightened, not theirs. These are the spiritual descendants of the same people who in Germany in the 1930s urged the election of Adolph Hitler for the same reason.
Politics is not the art of the possible, as you may have been taught in high school Civics, or even the art of the compromise, as you may have learned in Poly.Sci. 101, but a much more serious art: the art of seeing who gets how much of what from whom.
11
We, of course, are the who who haven't gotten any of anything from you know who.
There can be no denying then that the direction Black and poor people must take in the remainder of the 1970s is toward a real and meaningful participation in a new politics.
That is because it is politics that decides, in the end, what kind of life each of us will have, what ] 10 kind of world we live in, what kind of futures our children will have.
It is politics that sent our sons and brothers and uncles and fathers to Southeast Asia, to shoot and kill and be killed by other mother's sons in a war made by politicians; it is politics that will bring them back.
It is politics that decides that unemployment for Black people will remain at two and three times the national average, and it is
12
politics that decides that we will live in a permanent depression, and it is politics that can put money in our pockets and give us jobs or a liveable, not laughable, income now.
It is politics that decides that we must live in second and third hand homes that others have discarded or in vertical prisons of concrete and glass designed by some architect who lives in the suburbs. It is politics that made it impossible for so many of us to ] 11 earn a living back down home, and ran us into the cities to be squeezed together like sardines in a can, and it is politics that will enable us to take over some of the cities where we live, and turn them into the kinds of places where everyone wants to live and raise their children.
It is politics that gives our children lead poisoning, and it is politics that has created socialism for Lockheed Aircraft and welfare capitalism for the poor.
13
It is politics that makes us the last to be hired and the first to be fired; that gives our kids children twelve years of school but only six years of education; that has made us first in war on the battlefield, but last in peace, and seldom in the hearts of our countrymen.
But the kind of politics that has done these things to us is not the kind of politics that we must play; our politics must be different and new. ] 12
The kinds of politics that have been played on us must not be played by us. This doesn't mean that we must be soft or say no when we want to say yes; it only means that other people's dirty theirs are not for us.

What we must strive for - without or without that vanishing American species, people of good will, - is to put ourselves in a position to enforce the demand that the political party that received 98% of our automatic support in 1964 and 1968 return demonstrate its gratitude by returning to us jobs, housing, funds and decision-making in direct proportion to our percentage of their total vote - over 20% in 1968.
We have got to stop being the illigitimate child at the family reunion, while the fam waiting in the kitchen while the family members - the military-labor complex, the politically promiscuous white South, the corrupt big city machines, the respectable fringes of organized crime - divide the gravy.
This cannot be achieved by endorsing candidate X or Y before the convention, or by having Black delegates in Miami Beach who are Black only through an accident of their birth, and who must ask their white bosses ] 13 before they are allowed to shuffle away.
It could be begun by seeing that whoever represents you when the Democrats choose their Ph Presidential candidate is someone who has an allegiance to issues, to withholding his or her vote until the candidate comes along who pledges to make good on 30 years of rhetoric.
It requires delicate balance between the two competing impulses; first, to defeat Richard Nixon and next, the strong desire not to continue to be the last unrewarded Democrats in America.
The election choice in November of 1972 will be between two Anglo-Saxon men, in their 50s or older. 
The chances for a successful alternative party being built between now and Nov. 72 are less than slim.
One of these 2 men will be named Richard Nixon; the other could be anyone, if only you can help insure it is the right anyone. ] 14 
If  You can tell this ""anyone"" he can have your support if he comes your way to get it.
If there is anyone who believes it makes no difference who is President in this country, ask yourself these questions:
Who nominated Carswell and Haynesworth to the Supreme Court
14
(then who) put the Minnesota Twins there?
Who made John Mitchell the Attorney General of the United States?
Whose Department of Injustice tolerates murder at Attica, San Quentin, at Jackson State, at Orangeburg, at Kent State?
Who gave the Cinderella Bridegroom from South Carolina, Strom Thurmond, veto power over judicial appointees and school integration decisions?
Whose Secretary of Defense says that the war against the Vietnamese people may end but American soldiers will be in Vietnam for many years to come? ] 15
Who is afraid of the Hillbilly Hitler from Alabama? 
Who was it who made the gate-mouthed Maryland  farmer from Maryland the Vice President of The United States?
Who was that man?
15
And who were the people who let him do these things? With some exceptions, it was the Congress of the United States, the Representatives whose terms expire every two years, and the Senators whose terms expire every six (years).
You should check yours out. They may be perfect men. If they are not, don't just check them out, kick them out.
In 1968, out of a voting population of 120 million people, only 73 million voted. Richard Nixon received 31 million votes, but half again as many people, 47 million, did not vote at all.
It can be done, but it never will be done by people who think they can smoke America to her knees. It will not be done if your major concern is macrobiotic diets, or music, or drugs, or the relative revisionism of the late Ho Chi Minh, or the romantic rhetoric of revolution, or the enobling sacrifice of self-induced poverty; or
[This insert notation is handwritten. The editors have followed it with the content intended for inclusion here.] (insert)
(insert page 15)
These figures could be reverdversed, and the architects of the Southern strategy retired. ] 16 
This will never be done, however, until we develop the ability to do more than just talk about our politics. We must develop the ability to punish our enemies and reward our friends, remembering that the allies of today may be the antagonists of tomorrow.
We have to free our politics from dependence on outside planning and outside funding.
We have got to be able to make good our promises and our threats.

if you enjoy Woodstock while you tolerate Watts; or if Boone's Farm, or if Bid Whist is your major preoccupation, or if shouting ""off the pig"" replaces the hard and dirty work of organizing the dispossed into an effective force for change.
Remember, if you will undertake this task some words from the past, from the great abolitionist Frederick Douglass, who said:
""If there is no struggle, there is no progress. Those who profess to favor freedom and yet deprecate agitation are men who want crops without plowing up the ground. They want the rain without thunder and lightning. They want the ocean without the awful roar of her might waters. The struggle may be a physical one, and it may be a moral one, or it may be both moral and physical, but there must be a struggle. Power concedes nothing without a demand. It never has, and it never will...""

It is a distinct honor for me, a recent college graduate, to address you on the occasion of your reaching academic maturing.
It is customary on occasions like this one to tell you that the world outside these ebony towers is yours for the asking, and that now that you are armed with a degree , a job, home, family and security will follow closely.
Most of you, however, know that simply isn't true.
If you were graduates of some other school, if your skins were not dark, if you didn't live in a society where racism strangles every aspiration of black people, then your futures would be different. You could be content with the mild affluence which will surely be enjoyed by some of you.
But since you are the proud descendants of African peoples, your task is much more difficult than the mere acquisition of middle class middle-minded values and standards.
What you must do is make what you have learned here valuable to the millions who never see the inside of a lecture hall, who never hear ""Pomp and Circumstance"" played for them, who never will get to enjoy the benefits that come from the piece of parchment you receive today. If you do not do this, then your years here - and all your years on earth to date - are wasted years, and you have been majoring in ""Boones' Farm"" and minoring in "" Bibd Whist. ""
There is a great deal made today of student activism, its successes and failures, its starts and stops. But you - most of you - will stop
2
being students today, and therefore you beome part become part of that great group of people in this country who go to jobs every day, come home at night, and get up and go meet the man again and again.
You are all adults, and thereforec are semi-citizens in a country populated mostly by white people that still tries to dominate a world whose population is 3/4 non-white.
That is the single most important fact that you will have to deal with in the future, as it has been the most important fact in the lives of black people in this country since we were dragged here screaming 352 years ago.
In thos 352 years, race has always colored our lives.
Some years ago, a distinguished poet who taught at Howard University wrote a poem whose lines include this refrain:
""They got the lawyers
They got the judges
They got the jury-rolls
They got the law
   they don't come by ones
They got the sheriffs
They got the deoputies
   they don't come by twos
They got the rope
   We get the justice, in the endThey don't come b
And they come by tens.
Their fists stay closed
Their eyes look straight
   Our hands stay open
   Our eyes must fall
      They don't come by ones
They got the manhood
They got the courage
      They don't come by twos
3
   We got to slink around
   Hangtailed hounds
They burn us when we dogs
They burn us when we men
   They come by tens
Part of that poem by Sterling Brown is still true. They are still demonstrating their courage, as three of them apparently did last week when they apparently shot down an innocent black girl from a speeding automobile in a Mississippi town last week.
The difference now - and you are hopefully a part of that difference - is that we no long have to slink around like hangtail hounds.
That difference occurred because thiousands of young black people like yourselves, coming from schools very much like this one, choose to interrupt their education to work full time with black men and women in the heart of the rural, black belt South. Young people like Clarence Mitchell a Morgan graduate and a 
From those days, eleven years ago, building then on a heritage of struggle left us by our forebears, there was constructed a movement that still thrives today.
A great many people think that it is dead, that the death of some of its leaders may have killed the movement. A great many people think that it is dead because of what they presume to be irreconcible divisiveness among us. And some few foolish people thinkk it is dead because they see us having some few of the things we should have had all along.
But neither the death of leaders or the attainment of some goals or even ideological splits have chrushed what black people are building for ourselves in this country. That is a community, and a community we were each born into, a community from which non of us escape, and from which
4
none of us ought ever wish to escape.
It is a community of loving people who have never lynched anyone. a people who never blew up an airplane to collect insurance on our mothers, and a community that never anhilated 6 million people because we didn't like their religion, a community that never tried to impose our culture or religion on other lands and other peoples, a community where me [Typeset changes here and following.] we have have never tried to make war on innocent peoples miles away who never did us one bit of harm.
As members of that community, you have a responsibility to work for the good of the total that community, for the uplift of your brothers and sisters, your mothers and fathers.
This is your special job, not because your mothers and fathers didn't try; their trying helped to put you through school, sacrificed and scrimped to get you that degree, worked two jobs to be sure you could make it through four years here. The dedication and sacrifice of your elders makde it possible to build this school and the 100 other colleges and universities like it that have traditionally produced the leadership class of the black community.
It is your job simply because the people who caused the problems we suffer from - the problem they like to call the ""Negro Problem"" , couldn't care less whether we rise or fall, live or die.
Therefore the burden of escape fall on us, the victims of the 20th century's continuing crime of racism, domestice colonialism and warfare capitalism.
The question for you to answer - and to answer in an intelligent fashion now that you are armed with the correct academic credentials - is how to solve the white problem in America?
There are, of course, no easy answers, but there are surely several ways in which it can't be done.
5
It won't be done if you believe that the depth of your committment can be measured simply by the length of your hair. It won't be done unless we can narrow the divisiveness that continuously threatens the black community. It won't be done unless and until we can get American to show as much concern for Black children in Selma as it now does for men in uniform in Saigon. It won't be done until men and women in Mississippi receive as much attention as two men on the moon, and it won't be done unless each of you decides that one result of your education is to prepare you for some serious attacks on the problems that afflict us all, whether you have a degree from Morgan State, or can't whether you work wash dishes in the campus dining hall.
As you begin your jobs in the world outside these ebony towers, there are ever present dangers around you.
These dangers range from the classic indifference of the vast majority of the American population all the way to the foolish preoccupations of the younger, college age members of that group, who somehow believe that love will conquer all, or that you can somehow smoke America to her knees.
If love would conquer all, and if love means never having to say you're sorry, then an awful lot of sorry people have loved making us live sorry lives for 352 years.
If you could smoke America to her knees, then there would be an awful lot of problem free young people in this country today.
The dangers, however, are greater than actual indifference and passivity. There are those people in this country who think the few inches of advancement we have made over the last several years are miles too great, and who will never rest until they have destroyed the gains of the Second American Reconstruction, gains won at lunch counters, voting booths, on country roads and Northern streets, and in Southern jails by young people like you.
6
These dangers include the perverse little key-hole peeper who runs the national police force, who can arrest Angela Davis but who to this day can't say who murdered four little black girls in a Birmingham church so many years ago; the dangers include the political pornographies and the repugnant rhetoric of the gate-moutherd Maryland farmer who presides over the Senate; the dangers include the open hearted people lovers who want you to sign a petition against discrimination in Iceland, but won't do anything about discrimination in their own factories and schools; these dangers include the people who want us to be equal, it if means we will have an equal chance to be poor, and equal chance [illegible] to get an bad education, and the more than equal chance we already have to fight + die for somebody else's freedoms thousands of miles from home.
I propose that you want watch these dangers and beware of that kind of equality; that you make up your mind that your life from this day onward will be equally divided between persuing your professions or furthering your education, providing for your family, and working for your community.
I propose that you guard against being diverted from the main struggle. You must avoid the foolish kind of adventurism that results in appealing rhetoric but also increases repression; revolution is seldom advanced through constant exercise of the vocal cords, and slander, however clever, will never substitute for scientific analysis.
Woodstockism cannot be tolerated when Watts exists; ROTC on the camous must not compete for your attention with rats in the ghetto; your struggle is here and now with your people, to lift us up, to make us strong.
Don't let anyone tell you things ought to get worse in order to make them better, to heighten the contradictions; that only means that your contradictions will be heightened, not theirs.
Finally, set for yourself a goal and a standard by which you must live.

It is traditional at a ceremony like this one to tell you that you are embarking on a great journey through an uncharted sea steering with the compass of your education, sailing under sails raised by your own brilliance, but that, however difficult your course, you are to remember that we are all of us - Black and white, rich and poor - all in the same boat. That may be true, but it's leaking under Black people's seat:
You are entering into the real world outside of these ebony towers at an interesting time. You are the spiritual descendants of those young people who 11 years ago, coming from schools very much like this one, demonstrated that young people could make a difference, first at lunch counters and bus stations, then at county courthouses and voting booths all over this dark region of
2
the country.
Throughout the decade of the '60s, young people the age that most of you are now, faced police dogs and fire hoses and midnight murderers and jails in order to bring a small taste of democracy to this region of the country.
And over these years, a certain sort of progress occurred. 
But there is always difficulty in measuring what social scientists call ""progress."" This is particularly true of Black people, because we are a people on a see-saw - we go up in one direction and down in another.
The 1960s were years of one kind of incredible swift movement for us: we moved from social and political slumber into mild activism into open - if shortlived - rebellion.
Since the beginning of the last half of that decade, we have struggled through a continuing period of evaluation, attempting
3
to discover not just who we are and where we have come from, but where it is we want to go.
That is a tall question, and its discussion, particularly among those many, many sympathizes and empathizers of the Black movement, occupies more time than the achieving of any goal.
The trouble is that many people talk about revolution, but do nothing about it; they talk about reform, but do nothing about it.
We live in an age where social activism is measured by whether one wears the right button or can mouth the latest slogan - even President Nixon can say ""Power To The People"".
Social concern today is measured by length of hair or thickness of smoke. America's youth have come to idolize Woodstock while ignoring Watts.
Human responsibility is measured on a scale which charts whether one adheres to the ""Newton"" or ""Cleaver"" positions, and
4
whether or not you can master the latest intricacies of the latest pseudo-African handshake.
But that is not good enough; It simply will not do.
Today's college students and college graduates are direct descendants of an activist generation, a generation that began activism aimed at the question of where one has to sit on a bus or at a lunch counter.
Today, of course, the questions are much more complex, while the direction of too many of the young has become altogether too simple.
A great deal has been made by some scholars and pollsters of the difference in the demands of Black and white student activists. The whites want revolution, the experts say, while all the Blacks want, despite their revolutionary rhetoric, is reform, a chance to bend the established system to their own ends,
5
which are as safe and as ordinary as those shared by the rest of middle class America.
Therein lies, I think, the dangerous conflict present in the Black mind on the American campus. The Black student is torn between the need for a regular, formal education, part of the socialization process that we are told everyone needs in order to seek an acceptable role in society, and his need to carve out a new education experience, one that is meaningful to him as a Black person.
A young girl, a student at Tougaloo College in Mississippi, summed up this feeling when she wrote of her reaction to learning that Tougaloo and Brown University had entered into an educational compact, with Brown acting as big brother.
""We argued,"" she wrote, ""that Tougaloo could do better, that we did not have to pattern ourselves after Brown or any of the Ivy
6
league schools, that we had a unique opportunity to make Tougaloo a revolutionary institute of learning. We questioned the notion that places like Brown offered a superior education; we felt in fact that they dealt in mid-education. We felt that if schools like Brown had been truly educating their students then the state of the country and the world would be a lot different.""
The dilemma of whether to change the Tougaloos of the world or to get what can be gotten from the Browns is the continuing one among young Blacks. 
This dilemma must be solved if the graduates of today - and all of the future graduates, students, and teachers and administrators at schools like this one are to have a chance at what every oppressed people have always demanded - a chance at having something to say about what is being done to us.
This is the impulse which motivated Cuban canecutters to
7
overthrow Batista: it is the impulse which is directing the quarter-century old successful struggle of the Vietnamese to govern themselves; it is the impulse which will triumph someday in Angola and Mozambique: it is this impulse which will eventually drive all white South Africans into the sea: and properly channeled, with some direction by trained minds like yours, it is the impulse which will determine whether or not Black people inside this country will live on the margin where we now merely subsist or whether or not we shall have full manhood rights here and now.
As the Tougaloo student I quoted from earlier says, ""The task for Black students and Black Americans is much greater than trying to change white institutions and their white counterparts in the South. The task is to create revolutionary institutes of learning. The act of trying to be a better person, or trying to imagine and create humane institutions is formidable, but we have
no other
8
no other alternative. We must have a prototype from which to build a good society. The point I make is an old one: That revolution is not only the seizure of power, but is also the building of a society that is qualitatively better than the one we presently live in."" *
But perhaps what the University's and society's response ought to be in sentiments like that is best expressed in the words of the late Dr. W. E. B. DuBois, words written almost 50 years ago.
Dr. DuBois said: ""... We believe that the vocation of man in a modern, civilised land includes not only the technique of his actual work but intelligent comprehension of his elementary duties as a father, citizen, maker of public opinion...a conservor of the public health, an intelligent follower of moral customs, and
9
one who can appreciate if not partake something of the higher spiritual life of the world. We do not pretend that this can be taught to each individual in school, but it can be put into his social environment, and the more that environment is restricted and curtailed the more emphatic is the demand that... (man) shall be trained and trained thoroughly in these matters of human development if he is to share the surrounding civilisation.""
Or indeed, if there is to be any civilization at all.

This is the impulse which motivated Cuban canecutters to overthrow Batista; it is the impulse which is directing the quarter-century old successful struggle of the Vietnamese to freegovern themselves; it is the impulse which will triumph someday in Angola and Mozambique; it is this impulse which will eventually drive all white South Africans into the sea; and properly chall channelled, with some direction by trained minds like yours, it is the impulse which will determine whether or not Black people inside this country will live on the margin where we now merely exist subsist or whether or not we shall have full manhood rights here and now.

That is because it is politics that decides - in the end - what kind of life each of us will have, what kind of world we live in, what kind of futures our children will have.
It is politics that sent our sons and brothers and uncles and fathers to Southeast Asia, to shoot and kill and be killed by other mother's sons in a war made by politicians; it is politics that will bring them back.
It is politics that decides that unemployment for Black people will remain at two and three times the national average, and it is politics that decides that we will live in a permanent depression,
2
and it is politics that can put money in our pockets and give us jobs or a liveable, not laughable, income now.
It is politics that decides that we must live in second and third hand homes that others have discarded or in vertical prisons of concrete and glass designed by some architect who lives in the suburbs. It is politics that made it impossible for so many of us to earn a living back home, and ran us into the cities to be squeezed together like sardines in a can, and it is politics that will enable us to take over the cities where we live, and turn them into the kinds of places where everyone wants to live and raise their children.
It is politics that gives our children lead poisoning, and it is politics that has created socialism for Lockheed Aircraft and welfare capitalism for the poor.
It is politics that makes us the last to be hired and the first to be fired; that gives our kids twelve years of school, but only
3
six years of education; that has made us first in war on the battlefield, but last in peace, and seldom in the hearts of our countrymen.
insert
Finally, it will be politics that decides whether you get $6,500 a year or $2400; whether mothers of children over six, or over three, are thrown on an already hostile and overcrowded job market or whether they will have the choice their middle-class contemporaries/ may have to work if they choose, or stay home and take care of the youngsters, if they choose.
But the kind of politics that has done these things to us is not the kind of politics that we must play: our politics must be different and new.
The kinds of politics that have been played on us must not be played by us. This doesn't mean that we must be soft or say no when we want to say yes; it only means that other people's dirty tricks 
4
are not for us.
The kind of politics we have suffered from has been the art of compromise and the art of the possible. That means that unless we compromise, everything is impossible.
Our politics has got to be a new art, the art of seeing who gets how much of what from whom.
The Black and the poor are the who who haven't been getting any of anything from you know who.
Together, we have got to play this new politics for our benefit. As Congressman Clay of Missouri says so well, ""We have no permanent friends, no permanent enemies, only permanent interests.""
We are not here to jump on one party or to embrace another.
We are not here to beg or to plead, or to ask for the impossible, but simply to get our thing together.
We must divorce ourselves from any illicit dependence on any
5
political party. That means we must recognize that the differences between the Democran and Republicrat parties are little enough: it is issues and interests that must motivate us.
The time has come for a politics in America that means you can vote without voting for your own enslavement, but can cast a vote, a poor people's vote, a vote that will bring you jobs, income, freedom and food, and real power in this country's decision-making process.
The immediate task of the American underclass right now, especially between now and November, 1972, is to organize. When you return to your homes, spread the word that a people together are a strong people, while a people apart will stumble and fall.
Hopefully, this country will choose a new President in 1972, and you have got to be prepared to have something to say about who
6
he or she will be.
Of course, you don't have to be involved in politics if you don't want to. If you want the people who have been running your business for 352 years to keep on doing it, they'll be glad to do it. They like doing it. They love doing it. They've gotten fat and sassy and rich doing it, while we've only gotten the kind of fat that comes from not eating properly. It's now time for us to get sassy too.
They've been doing it for so long that they think God himself ordained in his heaven for them to do it. After 352 years of sticking their fingers into other peoples' pies, here and all around the world, and pulling up all the plums for themselves, they must be tired. They ought to be tired of doing it by now, so lets get together and give them some rest.
We must decide now whether we want four more years of Nixon-Agnewism,
7
of four more years of five-o'clock shadow and half-past promises, of the gate-mouthed Maryland farmer , or whether now we're about the business of putting both of them out of business. [Handwritten.] //
That choice lies in our ability to organize our poverty into politics. The best politics is always ""democratic"" politics - that's with a small ""d"". That means that our we politicians must give the right to decide to each and every person. It means that we have to make our politics pay as much attention to a street light in a twenty-one foot alley as it does to international complications that may turn out the lights all over the world.
Our politics must be a politics that begins on your block even in your kitchen. It is a politics that doesn't begin and end on election day, but starts and never ends on the kind of schedule
8
we were used to when we're lucky to get a job: a schedule that runs from can to can't.
It is a politics that you have to take into church, into your children's schools, into every place you go. As you stand in line eight hours a day for your check, waiting to see a doctor who only sees a number and who doesn't see you, stand in line waiting for powdered food you wouldn't feed your cat, remember that the people you are fighting are driving to work in limousines, are eating steak and giving you bones. While you're sweating, they are swimming in their pools. If you falter and fail, remember that under Nixon, Rockefeller and Reagan you've got powdered milk for breakfast, powdered eggs for lunch, and if you're lucky, powdered potatoes for dinner.
Many of you us come from states where party reform is supposed to
9
open at least one of the political parties to the young, the poor, to Blacks and to women. You should put this reform to a real test, to see whether that reform means you too.
Some of you are from the twenty-offdd states where there will be Democratic Presidential primaries next year. You ought to get together [with Black politicians] in these states, the ones you help elect as well as the ones you hope to help out of office, to run your own candidates in these primaries next year, so that you can be represented at the 1972 conventions by someone who represents you, and not by the hand-servants orf organized labor or the hand-picked representatives of one of the Democratic candidates for President.
Many of you come from cities where the racial balance is quickly tipping in our favor. You should make sure that someone who looks like you gets a piece of the pie that others have been feeding from
10
for hundreds of years.
insert
If someone tells you that these cities aren't worth running, tell him that it's home to you, and you want to run your home. If someone tells you that politics is useless, tell them that's because the wrong people have been using politics to use too many of us for too many years.
Last week A few weeks ago , Vice-President Agnew suggested that some of us ought to imitate African leaders like Jomo Kenyatta. It is significant that he chose a country that fits his politics perfectly - fascist Spain - for these remarks. Well, if he wants us to imitate Jomo Kenyatta, and if he wants to keep on playing ""White Settler"", a lot of us are ready to begin playing Mau Mau.
None of us should believe that the future is rosy. Just this week, the Census Bureau and the Department of Labor Statistics released figures demonstrating that for every three steps forward
11
we take, we take at least two backward. Income for Black people over the past ten years increased, their report said, but our income is still only three-fifths what white people earn. More Black people than ever before are finishing college, but we are still more likely than whites to drop out of high school. Housing for Black people has improved over the last decade, but nearly half of the rural housing for Blacks is still substandard. Life expectancy for us is still less than that for white.
But, no one has to recite these dreary figures for us. They have been a part of daily life for too many of us for too many years. 
The time has long passed for us to take care of business, to seek political solutions to the political problems that plague us.
insert
We might do well to remember the words of a Black Georgian, written in 1884. The man's name was T. Thomas Fortune, and he said
12
then:
""... The American people are fostering in their bosoms a spirit of rebellion which will yet shake the pillars of popular government as they have never before been shaken, unless a wiser policy is inaugurated and honestly enforced. All the indications point to the fulfillment of such a declaration.
""When a society fosters as much crime and destitution as ours, with ample resources to meet the actual necessities of everyone, there must be something radically wrong, not in the society but in the foundation upon which society is reared.""
""The streets of every city in the Union are full of people who have been made desperate...""
""The hour is fast approaching when the laboring classes of our country, North, South, East and West, will recognize they have a common cause, a common humanity, and a common enemy; and
13
that therefore, if they would triumph over wrong and place the laurel wreath upon triumphant justice, without distinction of race or previous condition, they must unite.... when the issue is properly joined, the rich, be they Black or white, will be found on one side, and the poor, be they Black or white, will be found on the other.""*"

By that, we can mean our political, educational, or economic business. In general, we mean our ability to have some control over our own lives.
That single impulse is the great motivator among all men - it inspired American immigrants many years ago to g fight a war for independence; it inspired Cuban canecutters to overthrown a doctator; it has inspisred Alabama shraecroppers and Mississippi cotton pickers to risk their lives in their attempts to register to vote; it is inspiring the heroic Vietnamese in the their successful struggle to overthrow the blue eyed agressors from America. 
There can be no doubt that things have generally improved over the past 352 years from most of us. We can now sit downstairs in movie theatres; ] 2 can ride in the front of busses; can go to schools we used to get bussed past; can eat at lunch counters where we were never welcome before.
Despite that improvement, we obviously have a long way to go. A Black Georgian who lived 100 years ago, Henry McNeill Turner, correctly described our condition then. His words are all too true today.
[Typeset changes, and several paragraphs are cut from other pages and stapled into the following order.]
He said then: ""We have pioneered a civilisation here. We have built up your country. We have worked in your fields, we have gathered your harvests, for 250 years.... We, who number hundreds of thousands... have not a foot of land to 
2
call our own. We are strangers in the land of our birth, without money, without education, without aid, without a roof to cover us while we live or clay to cover us when we die.""
It might be argued that conditions have improved a bit since then, but objectively, things are still pretty much the same.
The traditional ladders of upward financial mobility open to the voluntary immigrants who came to these shores seeking freedom from ] 3 oppression are were closed to us, the America's single group of involuntary arrivals. The European/American drew his strength from his ability to retain and draw from his European culture, while the African/American saw his culture, language, religion and family destroyed. As slavery passed from the scene, we entered into a permanent phase of un- and under-employment from which we have yet to emerge, while the European found the growth of mercantile capitalism especially fitted to his cashbox mentality.
We have had to endure physical and verbal abuse , take hand me down housing...cast off clothes raggedy pawn shop furniture...third and fourth hand books... debilitated automobile for transportation... spend exhorbitant bus, train and subway fares to get to our jobs which never met with gave us dignity when we got to them, and yet we are still told we have to pull ourselves up by our bootstraps.
This is a cruel suggestion for a people without any boots at all. But we have survived. We wear our battle scars proudly and continue to move and mobilize our people to obtain the right to a decent life where ] 4 our culture, our beauty, our soul can be reflected in the kind of ways necessary to mark our communities politically whole and financially stable.
Moving in this direction we must begin taking advantage of the various methods available to us. We should not single out any one method or way to make ourselves free.
With our history of oppression and the current and past + present climate of repression aimed at us, with the might of government aimed at protecting the power of the few who have against the many who have not, with the official economic policy of the United States socialism and welfare millionarism for the wealthy and capitalism and free enterprise for the poor, it is no wonder that economic development stands high on our list of priorities.
[Typeset changes.]
Minority Business Enterprise and the Nixon Administration
Richard Nixon and his supporters are somewhat proud of their accomplishments in the field of minority enterprise. And oOn paper it seems as if the present administration has accrued quite a record. The minority enterprise program has included: 
(a) The appropriation of over $100 million in new funds going directly to the office of Minority Business Enterprise (OMBE).
(b) There has been an increase in the aggregate total of federal business loans, guarantees, grants and purchases over the last three fiscal years from $200 million in 1969 to $566 million in 1971.
(c) In an attempt to stimulate minority banking a program was set up to assure $100 million in new deposits. $35 million came from the government and $65 million was extracted from private sources.
(d) During the past 15 months 49 new Minority Enterprise Small Business Investment Companies (MESBICS) have been licensed.
(e) Additionally a new executive order was issued giving the Secretary of Commerce an increased authority and coordination role over all federal activities in the minority enterprise field.
The question that still remains is what real effect if any did ] 4 this have on the black businessman and the total black community. A Commerce Department census study done in 1970 found that there are 322,000 minority businesses that collectively do $10.6 billion to business. These figures show that while minority entrepreneurs are four percent of the total business population of the U.S., they only account for 0.7 percent of the total receipts. On neither count do we come close to the 17 percent figure that would be necessary for the parity that is desired.
4
Despite the much publicized  efforts of the Nixon Administration, its Minority Program has not been an overwhelming success . though it must be pointed out that this Administration has done more to advance business opportunities for blacks than any other. The fact is, however, that the position of blacks in America has not changed substantially during the last
5
four years. While the GNP of the total black community was $39 billion dollars in 1970, the median income of a black family was $6,279. That figure is only 2/3 as much as their white counterpart; and is not a real gain over the $6,191 median income figure from 1969. Consumer prices rose during 1970, so in terms of constant dollars, the median family income ] 6 of Blacks in 1970 was about the same as 1969.
This same lack of accomplishment is seen in almost every other area. Blacks only account for 6% of the population in institutions of higher education. And only 3.5% of those enrolled actually earn a degree, as compared with 9.1% for the total population.
The incidence of black home ownership is18 times smaller than that for whites. Of the black working population, 27.9% are employed in white collar positions while more than half of the white working force have such jobs.
Within the black community, it can be said that the war on poverty has not been all but lost. surrendered. 31.1% of the black population live on earnings that place them below the recognized poverty line. This number is three times the figure for the whole community.
If we are seriously talking about changing the position of the black man in America we must be talking about more intensive, extensive and expansive programs from the federal government. If we look just at the ] 7 area of minority enterprise, with the goal of expanding the gross receipt of the nation's minority businessmen from its present figure or less than 1% to the 17% they we are entitled to, in terms of their  our population; it would require an increase in government spending from the presently spent $11 billion is almost $105 billion.
Earlier last year, the 13 members of the Black Congressional Caucus, presented President Nixon with a list of economic request.
The basic list included:

A permanent job creation program with jobs targeted for urban and rural areas with chronically high employment conditions.
A federal public works employment program designed to create 1,100,000 full time new jobs during its first year of operation.
Immediate upgrading of minority Veterans Administration employees who have been historically confined to jobs in grade GS-8 or less.
Improvements in the selection, testing and promotion procedures in federal agencies so as to insure equal employment opportunities.
Vigorous enforcement of affirmative action codes where there is abuse of equal employment opportunity laws, guidelines and codes.
A new development bank with an initial appropriation of $1 billion to aid minority businesses.
Use Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation assets to provide assistance to minority firms.
An increase of $25 million for Community Development Corporations which provide technical assistance to ghetto firms. 
Require contractors on federally aided construction projects to set aside a specified percentage of their subcontracting work for minority-owned firms.
An increase in the federal management and technical assistance now available to minority trade groups and similar association of minority businessmen.

The President rejected each one.
Despite the please for more federal assistance to the Black community generally, despite a well spelled out plan for economic assistance to the black community generally, the present administration continues to urge that
[Typeset changes.]
that the business system, not the government, will save us from economic destitution. The business system knows better. A much more candid statement of what business will and will not do under existing circumstances is the following from the publisher of The Bankers Magazine: 
He says ""Despite all the exhortations at business symposiums , social and economic threats inherent in racial schism , and violence in America have not yet reached the crisis proportions which would make business anti-poverty efforts a vital business need - essential to the continuance of corporate profits, the preservation of capital, or the survival of commerce. As long as this is the case, effort by private business to rehabilitate... the ghetto economy... will fail since the effort does not fulfill essential corporate needs or the need to make a profit, ] 12 whatever is being sold to whomever for whichever reason."" 1
10
The author of that statement is also the founder of the Atomic Energy Law Journal, a director of the Bank Tax Institute and current chairman of the Banking Law Institute. He is saying very clearly that Black people will never have economic freedom unless they we muster the force to threaten or counter or nearly parallel the existence of the entire American economic system. I suspect that if he were Black, talk like that would get him thrown in jail and I am sure he hates Black people who talk about destroying the economic system that has created his own highly privileged status. But I also suspect that He is right about how far we will have to be prepared to go if we are ever going to be free. We had better face the situation and get ourselves ready to take care of business, whether it is the kind of business he represents, or the kind of humanistic, non-capitalistic business that represents commerce in human relationships, not in dollars and cents.
As Cross said in his book Black Capitalism, ""The painfully apparent features of the ghetto economy are its economic weakness, a low level of productivity, and the poverty level of its consumers.""
Dr. Kenneth Clark's description of our neighborhood, the ghetto, as ] 11 a ""social, educational, political and economic colony"" is especially important for us to remember.
What we must do, I believe, is connect positive programming with the various groupings of Black people who are striving towards the same goal.
12
For instance, in Alabama the SWAFCA program is currently engaged in developing land programs and collectively farming the land. Black people now own substantial acreage and are producing needed food and fiber for other Black people. Yet little recognition of this worthwhile program has come from the Black businessmen of the North, Midwest or western cities who are developing their own economic programs to promote Black business. These plans, like that presently underwritten by the honorable Elijah Muhammad in the South, operations which put Black people into a healthy and productive relationship with our environment land, must receive national support.
Furthermore, we ought to strive toward further collectivization of our economic thrust, so that we do not get caught up in the degrading practice ] 12 of some of us obtaining all the wealth while our brothers and sisters are still hungry.
It is cruel and criminal to have outmoded capitalism thrust
13
upon us, either dressed in Black or under its new, presumably less offensive name, minority entrepreneurship. Capitalism has not solved white people's problems. If it had, physicists Engineers in Seattle would not be driving taxi cabs today. What we need is something more properly described as ""community socialism"", enabling a larger share of us to get our hands on the dollars that pass through - and all too often, out - of our community. That means that if an economic enterprise does business in our community, we have to stop being consumers but must become owners as well. As much as I despise racketeering, prostitution and the numbers, if these are to be tolerated by the white controlled law enforcement agencies that rule this country, then we must control them too. It is too much to keep us from even making a dishonest dollar in our own community. 
In short, we must control what exists where we are. We must always strive for the greatest good for the largest number of us.
14
That means trying to control General Motors as much as it means trying to take over the corner mom and pop store, although the first is unlikely and the second may simply exchange color of the neighborhood cheats.
If the second is done, however, it may lay the foundation for a series of growth steps for us, leading from our store to our farm to our distribution system to what is most important, money in the pockets of our people.
If the first is done, and General Motors through some miracle should fall into our hands, it might mean we could build an automobile that would last for more than eighteen months.
If both these adventures are begun, begun seriously with our people in mind and their interests foremost, then something must succeed.
If nothing, does and if, as it appears it will, times get harder, then we had better seriously prepare to take care of business ourselves.

The confusion doesn't exist because we don't know what our problems are; it exists only because we either profess ignorance about methods of solving them, or have no real interest in having them solved.
The confusion surrounding Black people, and our traditional difficulties with the so-called American way of life stems from our status in this country as a colonial people, and from the fact that we ware increasingly being forced to employ the traditional methods and techniques of the colonial subject to escape from the oppression of the colonial power.
There are always objections made to the descriptions of ""us"" and ""them"" as components of the colonial equation; the argument runs this way:
2
First we are told that we are nationalized Americans, and not a people of separate identity. We are told that the Constitution of the United States supports equal citizenship, and that our sub constitutional status is a matter of chance, and not design. And we are told that the racism which affects us is based on historical preference and not economic profit, as it has been in the historical model of African, Asian, and Latin American colonialism.
But we are citizens only in the narrow sense in that we must meet certain obligations to the state, without receiving all of the corresponding benefits of citizenship. We all pay taxes, but because more of us are poor, and because the poor pay more, and because some of the rich pay nothing, we pay more of our share for less of the rewards taxpayers rightfully expect.
Black and white men alike are subjected to the opportunity to serve this country militarily, but through this present attack by our country on the people of Southeast Asia, we have managed to become
3
first in war, last in peace, and seldom in the hearts of our countrymen.
While We- like most other Americans - came here as immigrants, but most immigrants came voluntarily, seeking freedom and a chance to survive. My ancestors came in chains, husband torn from wife, child from mother.
In a land where family and education are venerated, we were denied the chance to learn and to maintain a stable family unit. In a country populated with sufferers from religious [prosecution] persecution, we found a stranger and alien religion forced upon us.
While we came from a land whose inhabitants believed in communalism and the extended family, we found created here a system of mercantile capitalism that exactly fitted the cash box mentality of the Founding Fathers.
From that day to this, the separate status of Black people here has been a fact. From that day to this, we have been the Africans, suffering at the hands of Europeans.
4
The argument is also made that Blacks enjoy legal status here as do all Americans. Of course, on paper, that is largely true, but the plain facts are that certain constitutionally guaranteed rights - like the right to vote and to enjoy other forms of social and political participation - are still subjected to intense debate, not only in the Southern states but in the White House itself.
In short, we are in bad shape. We live and work in situations provided for by the majority, not by us. We exist at the pleasure and sufferance of the American majority, and the evidence is mounting that that existence itself may soon be called into question.
Part of the difficulty is that the traditional solutions to our dilemma - solutions employed with great success by other ethnic groups - will not mold themselves entirely to our deliverance.
Individual entrepreneurship has created a class of Black millionaires in publishing, insurance and the cosmetic fields, but
5
has done little for the economic uplift of most Black people.
Pressure group politics has won many needed reforms for our group, but these reforms are nearly impossible to make secure in a colonial society.
We had believed, for instance, that the battle for the integrated schoolroom seat was won in 1954, with only slight pressure needed from then on to finish the job.
The truth was that none of the administrations in Washington since then - particularly including this one - ever intended to make the dream of an integrated education a reality.
The traditional coalitions of Black people, labor, the more enlightened church leadership have failed in bringing about the beloved society that was the dream of the early '60's.
The American labor movement has begun to show its true colors as Black people began demanding not only labor connected goals like minimum wages, but entry into the craft unions which have always been
6
lily white. The churches at their worst have all too often played a gadfly role; Black people today, the war in Vietnam tomorrow, abortion reform the next.
The hoped-for coalition with white college students has failed to materialize, as far too many of this group have shown more interest in music, drugs, the romantic rhetoric of revolution and the enboling sacrifice of self-enforced poverty than in the very real problems of existence that afflict most Black people in this country.
So we are left to an ever spiraling scale of politics and then protest and then revolt, with the probable result that increasing repression will follow.
Here is a description of the process:
""The people with fewest illusions about the welfare state are the poor who are served by it. When they protest, usually in the name of American ideals, an interesting reaction follows. Some among the
7
majority react sympathetically, though not always with real understanding of the causes. But a sufficient number of opposing interests are aroused to prevent any drastic change, and often even moderate changes are blocked. The poor, who in most cases begin by politely petitioning their governors, soon take more drastic steps, thinking they can perhaps awaken the conscience of the majority or at least of higher authorities. They do awaken the conscience of some people, and to some extent they force elites to concede token changes. But at the same time, a 'counterrevolution' is triggered against the potential of revolution which has been seen in the mounting protest. The system becomes deadlocked. No more than token reforms, crumbs, result for the protestors. The scale of their protest increases as they realize that appeals to conscience are inadequate. They look for methods of transcending the pressure politics that have not worked. They begin civil disobedience and disruption. The immediate reaction of the power structure is to maintain order. The police are brought
8
into the conflict. Considerations of social, political or economic solutions to the conflict are gradually replaced by the emphasis on law and order. Violent repression becomes routine.""1
It becomes clear from that analysis that the only escape from this trap is revolution, either violent on the part of both sides of the question, or a revolution in thinking, psychology and political position on at least one side.
It is that second revolution that is bursting upon us today.
It springs, first of all, from the Black community. It is a revolution in thinking about ourselves, a revolution turning upside down the analysis that had made us - the victims - describe ourselves as the causes of our own condition.
It is found most concretely in the growing desire among Black people to reject the kind of tribalization of class and geography that has divided us for so long, and to bring us together as a
9
nation within this nation.
It is found in the rejection by Black people of white standards of beauty and qualification that have plagued us for so long.
But that cultural and psychological revolution will not do the job alone. We may - as we are slowly about to do - take over the major cities of this country and hold them as enclaves against increasing repression, charging admission fees to suburban whites who must come to the city for jobs and income, and who must depend on the city as a source of police protection and utility service.
But we would also like to depend on white America as a source of simple decency of treatment, a hope that many would call extremely naive.
We would like, for example, to be treated as well as American farmers are. First they were given free lands. Then they were given low interest loans to enable them to buy farm machinery. Then the Department of Agriculture sent out farm agents to show them
10
how to use their machines and to rotate their crops. Now we pay them not to do anything, a form of millionaire welfarism that is scorned for poor people.
Suppose, for example, that an ADC mother was paid not to produce at the same rate that the gentleman farmer from Mississippi Senator James Eastland is. That would mean that welfare mothers in Detroit or Chicago or Los Angeles could collect as much as $125,000 a year for not having babies.
But the revolution demands that we be allowed not more than, but simply the same as other groups. Why, we ask, must patronage be abolished as a political reward when Blacks take over the cities after political favoritism has done so much for Italians and Irishmen? Why must good government advocate metropolitanism as a panacea to urban ills at a time when we are about to take over some cities?
Why must some women - most of them white - and some homosexuals - most of them white - and some other groups insist that our liberation is dependent on theirs?
11
The answer must be that no one - unless it is American Indians - has priority over the justifiable demands of Black people. And that only Black people can set the pace, techniques and methods used by Black people in our struggle.
Foremost among these must be political action, but not the old style of machine politics of the unequal Black - labor - liberal - coalition that we have entered into like a willing bridegroom so many times in the past, only to emerge ravished and our innocence gone.
Our politics must be an aggressive independent politics, free from any alliances of party or partisanship that has made us slaves first to the party of Lincoln and now to the party of Roosevelt.
We must begin to seize power where we are, in the cities and the Black Belt counties of the Old Confederacy. As whites flee these areas for the comfort and security of the suburbs, they create a political vacuum that we must fill.
12
But the cities are crumbling beneath us, and the presence of a Black mayor alone will not insure that these decaying compounds will be liveable again.
The Black inhabitants of rural America have a better chance at achieving a decent life, for the cost of living is lower there and the people know better how to live, but even these victors will discover that political gains can be destroyed by an economy that still remains in the hands of the plantation bosses.
So, as we get our politics together, we must try to get our economics together as well. This means that while we reject the obviously absurd Nixonian notion of Black capitalism, we must not hesitate to accept any economic advantage that might accrue to our group as a whole.
This means striving for economic plans as different as the designs plotted by the Honorable Elijah Muhammad in the South to the
13
neighborhood cooperatives springing up in ghettoes across the country; to the transfer of mom-and-pop stores from white hands to Black ones; as well as any other plan or scheme that will put money into the pockets of Black people.
It means that we cannot afford the luxury available to so many dilettantes who seek to define for us what is right and what is wrong -- indeed, even what is Black, in our struggle. At a time when our community seems about to draw together an alliance of cultural nationalists and political activists, of poverty workers and poverty livers, of foot washing Baptists and the Nation of Islam, we cannot afford a Woodstock in a nation that still tolerates Watts; we cannot demand liberation for special groups until the whole group goes free.
That suggests that the fragile, sometime security of the college campus is not the proper place from which to engage in remote criticism of people who seldom see a book from year to year; that the presence of ROTC on the campus is not nearly as earthshaking an issue
14
as the presence of rats in the ghetto; that debates about the relative revisionism of the late Ho Chi Minh had best be neglected until we have started our own revolution here.
Finally, we must prepare for a time of trouble. If the provisions of the criminally insane Washington, D.C. Crime Act are any indication, or the unwillingness of the House Internal Security Committee to help abolish the concentration camp features of the McCarran Act are a signal for the future, then we had better beware and prepare for hard times ahead.
Through these hard times, we might prepare ourselves with the words of Frederick Douglass, who in 1894 was asked how the race problem might be solved. He said then:
""Let the white people of the North and South conquer their prejudices . . . . Let the American people cultivate kindness and humanity . . . . Let them give up the idea that they can be free
15
while making the Negro a slave. Let them give up the idea that to degrade the colored man is to elevate the white man . . . .
""They are not required to do much. They are only required to undo the evil they have done, in order to solve their problem . . . .
""Put away your race prejudice. Banish the idea that one class must rule over another. Recognize the fact that the rights of the humblest of citizens are as worthy of recognition as the rights of the highest, and your problem will be solved. And - whatever may be in store for you in the future, whether prosperity or adversity, whether you have foes without or foes within, whether there shall be peace or war - based on the eternal principles of truth, justice and humanity, with no class having cause for complaint or grievance, your republic will stand and flourish forever.""2

I would guess that no one here really believes the myth that our city is some kind of wonder city that is immune to the problems of this region or other cities in the United States. The slogan that Atlanta is a city ""too busy to hate"" is - and has been - empty Chamber of Commerce sloganeering.
The sixties have been great years for the wealthy and almost wealthy in Atlanta, but the sixties were great years for that class of people everywhere. For the rest of us, the sixties were years of gr frustration and struggle. The decade began and ended with high unemployment in Atlanta. It began with a svere housing shortage and ended with a greater one. It began with too many hungry, ill-educated people in this city receiving poor medical treatment, poor recreation and educational facilities, poor police protection and too frequent brutality, poor city services, inadequate pay for their labor, no protection against exploitative merchants and money lenders, and a city government much more interested in talking about these problems than in tackling them. As we enter 1971, none of these conditions has been solved and many of them have gotten worse. 
For example, in January, 1960, if you could not afford to own and drive an automobile, it cost 40 cents to ride a bus to and from the hospital or grocery store. In 1970, ten years later it costs 70 cents, and if the monopoly businessmen who control public transportation have their way, the same service will cost 80 cents - exactly 100% more than it did a decade ago. The cost of living for families here has
2
risen over 60%, while income for even Atlanta skilled workers has climbed only about 40%.
The early 1960s were a high-water mark of a great struggle in Atlanta and the Southeast for social and economic justice and racial equality. That struggle was waged by the efforts and sacrifices of thousands of Atlanta's black citizens. Ultimately it cost the life of the leader of that struggle, the life of a child killed by double-ought buckshot fired by a policeman in Dixie Hills, of young Andre Moore shot in the back of by Atlanta's finest, and of hundreds of nameless others throughout this region.
No one will deny that that period did much to eradicate some of the inhuman legal humiliations of the previous decades. But no honest person can fail to see that in 1971, Atlanta and the United States will have to undergo radicals changes before the land of the slave can' truly become the home of the free. 
Part of the solution to the problem which afflicts us is found inside us; a great part of it is found outside our immediate control. 
Outside of our control, for example, is the enormous military-labor-industrial complex which runs this country, and which has its greedy , racist blood-soaked fingers in every decision on foreign and domestice policy made by the government which rules us. 
The important factor here is that all these decisions are made pretty much by the same group of people. The same mentality that arms fascist governments in Greece and South Vietnam, but approves invasion of peaceful Guinea by mercenaries armed with American and NATO supplied arms, stands foursquare behind police murders at Jackson State Collge

[The following two paragraphs are from an unidentified newspaper clipping taped to the page, referred to as an insert on page 3.]
The agent based in Atlanta told of the attending a press conference called by the Southern Christian Leadership Conference - with phony press credentials identifying him as a reporter for the Richmond (Va.) Times-Dispatch— and of being assigned to a rally for the Poor People's campaign. During the march and rally, which took place a month after the assassination of the Rev. Martin Luther King, Jr., he was told keep in constant contact with Ft. Holabird, supplying information on the march. 
What dream?
""When Coretta King spoke,"" the agent said, ""she told the audience about how her husband had had a dream and now this dream was going to come true. When I called this in to the Field Office, I spoke to a Captain at my headquarters. He wanted me to go back and find out what dream she was referring to.""

and in Augusta. The architects of a foreign policy that condones apartheid in South Africa are the architects of ""the Southern strategy"" that threatens domestic apartheid here. The police state statesmen who support dictators around the globe are the same men who deploy Army spies and National chief of police J. Edgar Hoover to spy on those he disagrees with inside the United States.
[This handwritten note seems to refer to the previous page's newspaper clipping.] insert clip
In a like fashion, we cannot separate our destiny here from the destinies of millions of people of color across the globe. Hundreds of billions of dollars that might have been spent to move this nation toward economic and social justice have been poured into the murder of the people of Southeast Asia, into the gluttonous pockets of the tex-supported monopolistic weapons makers, into the greedy bins of large landowners who consume tax revenues instead of producing food and into ivory tower bureaucracies that laboriously re-evaluate each other, proposing last year's solutions to the problems of the last three centuries.
Closer to home, it is no secret that real power here has been concentrated in a very few hands. Only last week, former Mayor Ivan Allen revealed that truism when he observed that in 1947 at the age of 36 he was, in his words, ""one of those being chose to eventually take over the leadership of the city.""* Who did this chosing, selecting a 36-year-old white man who had never had any social intercourse with black people to run our lives? Certainly not you and I.
But the people who run this city have for years been choosing for us. They chose the wrong man in the last Mayor's race, but the activities of the last few days doesn't suggest that they did too badly
4
for themselves in the long run. 
It should become obvious, then, that an important item on our priority list for the rest of the 1970s ought to be choosing and selecting our own. 
This could have been done last November, when Andrew Young missed replacing the tin-horn cheap plastic imitation of Barry Goldwater who passes as our Congressman. Political scientists will argue for years to come why he lost, why 35,000 black people didn't vote, whether his 18% of the white vote could have been greater. The plain facts however, available to all of us; he could have won.
He could have won for example, if there existed still in this city an organization like the old Negro Voters League, certainly not a carbondn copy, but a city-wide grass-roots organization dedicated to promoting the political interests of the black community.
Quite naturally, one would expect the only geographically and democratically selected leaders in the black community to begin the task of building such a organization, but whoever takes on this task, there are certain rules that must be followed. 
Such a group must cast its votes as a single unit. It must declare itself in the interest of laboring people, but must not become the mistress of organized labor. It must pay as much attention to a street light in a 50-foot alley as it does to national legislation involving millions of people, and to international complications involving the future of the world. It must maintain a militance, agressiveness and independence which will assure its followers that it can not be bought. 
[Page 5 is missing in this version. See Doc 3 of 3, ID 450, for the following page 5 content:

If there are is to be any success with such a movement, it must observe certain undeniable facts.
First, that social, economic, educational, political and physical segregation and discrimination fill a very real need for the white majority.
- that appeals to justice and fair play are outmoded and useless when power, financail gain and prestige are at stake.
- that discrimination will be the rule unless change is forced through coercion, threats, power or violence;
- that initiative for black political action must come from within the black community, and must be sustained on a day-by-day basis, and finally, that racial self-interest, race consciousness, and racial solidarity must always be paramount in the words and deeds of black political activists; when self-interest is forgottenn, organized racism will continue to dominate and frustrate the best organized actions of any black political unit, and will leave it powerless and defenseless.
Next on our political agenda must be some means of escaping from the kind of slavish attention we pay to political parties, the kind of foolishness that made us slaves, first to the party of Lincoln, and next to the party of Roosevelt.
For example, Andrew Young could be living in Washington now if he had chosen to run as the candidate for a third party. White votes would have split between the Democratic and Republican nominees, and he could have won that election on the basis of the black votes he received alone.
We ought not be fooled by this token reformism that is going on in this state's Democratic party. They would have you believe it is]
6
being done voluntarily, the Governor-elect Carter is fulfilling a campaign pledge to bring the party back to the people. The truth is they are being forced to reform the party, and the hidden truth is that the infusion of democratic procedures into an undemocratic structure does not guarantee democracy will result. I predict that black and poor people will have even less to say about party affairs under this new arrangement than these groups had under the 1968 system when the governor dominated the entire selection process.
But whatever method and through whatever device, independent politics has got to be the wave of the future for black people. In Cleveland, Mayor Carl Stokes and his brother, Congressman Louis Stokes, have formed the 21 District Caucus, endorsing and electing Democrats and Republicans alike. At the other end of the spectrum in New York State, James Buckely is now a member of the United States Senate because he saw the virtue of independent politics, and Alabama now has three black sheriffs because and more elected black officials than supposedly more liberal Georgia because they recognize the necessity for independent politics. In South Carolina, an independent, nearly all-black political party will slate a candidate for the seat vacated by the death of Mendel Rivers whi with an excellent chance of victory. 
With a new political organization must come a new political ideology. We must for once an for all abandon the notion that the white man's ice is colder, his medicine stronger, his sugar sweeter. We have to encourage our young people not to follow in the footsteps of the diseased majority culture. The strange phenomenom of Morris Brown College students selling candy to the poverty stricken inhabitants of Vince City so that a band 
7
can spend $30,000 to go to California to appear ofn television for a d few seconds ought never be repeated. That $30,000 could have rebuilt one side all of the houses on one side of one short block of Vine Street, and Morris Brown would have left a lasting monument in its shadow, instead of a flickering image on the screen. The same might be said of the other Atlanta University Center institutions, and all of the institutions - churches, schools, business, social and civic clubs - that operate in our community.
And we must remind the same young people, black and white, that the vast majority of black people want concrete, visible, material improvement in their lives. They have no patience with those whose social involvement is limited to the romantic rhetoric of revolution, the enobling sacrifice of self-enforced poverty, or the latest fad that catches the attention of boutique radicals and limosine liberals.
We have to be on guard against sinister forces that that attempt to attack us from without, while we guard against decay from within. We ought to be especially alert to the approach of the police state as evidenced by the spy tactics more common in totalitarian states than in this one, and by the petty peversities of the little tyrant who runs the Federal Bureau of Investigation. Acting on concert with the Attorney General, the President, and the gate-mouthed Maryland Farmer who presides over the Senate, a frightening new ear era in American life has been reborn, reminding one of the McCarthyism of the 50s and the political apathy that ran rampant in that period. 
Finally, when one makes a speech like this he must realize he is saying old things describing old situations and some old solutions
8
to an audience that has heard it all before with no more indication of an inclination to action that the expected polite applause at the end.
Let us all hope that in 1971, unlike all of the other years that have gone before, we can make this year a year of action; action against poverty, racism, creeping facism and war. Severe action against our enemies and warmhearted helpful action toward our friends. 
An action which susposes that we would all agree with the credo written by former Atlantans, a great teacher and leader, and man whose widow will be visiting with our city shortly. His name was W. E. B. DuBois, and in his early years he wrote:
""I be ive in God who made of one blood all the races that dwell on earth. I believe that all men, black and brown and white are brothers, varying, through time and opportunity, in form and gift and feature, but differing in no essential particular, and alike in soul and in the possibility of infinite development. 
""But especially do I believe in the Negro race; in the beauty of its genius, the sweetness of its soul and its strengths in that meekness which shall inherit this turbulent earth...
""I believe in the Prince of Peace. I believe that war is murder. I believe that armies and navives are at bottom the tinsel and braggadacio of oppression and wrong, and I believe that the wicked conquest of weaker and darker nations by nations white and stronger but foreshadows the death of that strength.
""I believe in liberty for all men; the space to stretch their arms and their souls, the right to breath and the right to vote, to
9

I would guess that no one here really believes the myth that our city is some kind of wonder city that is immune to the problems of this region or other cities in the United States. The slogan that Atlanta is a city ""too busy to hate"" is - and has been - empty Chamber of Commerce sloganeering.
The sixties have been great years for the wealthy in Atlanta, but the sixties were great years for that class of people everywhere. For the rest of us, the sixties were years of gr frustration and struggle. The decade began and ended with high unemployment in Atlanta. It began with a svere housing shortage and ended with a greater one. It began with too many hungry, ill-educated, ill-housed people in this city receiving poor medical treatment, poor recreation and educational facilities, poor police protection and too frequent brutality, poor city services, inadequate pay for their labor, no protection against exploitative merchants and money lenders, and a city government much more interested in talking about these problems than in tackling them. As we enter 1971, none of these conditions has been solved, and many of them have gotten worse.
For example, in January, 1960, if you could not afford to own and drive an automobile, it cost 40 cents to ride a bus to and from the hospital or grocery store. In 1970, ten years later, it costs 70 cents, and if the monopoly businessmen who control public transportation have their way, the same service will cost 80 cents - exactly 100% more than it did a decade ago. The cost of living for families here has
2
risen over 60%, while income for even Atlanta's skilled workers has climbed only about 40%.
The early 1960s were a high-water mark of a great struggle in Atlanta and the Southeast for social and economic justice and racial equality. That struggle was waged by the efforts and sacrifices of thousands of Atlanta's black citizens. Ultimately it cost the life of the leader of that struggle, the life of a child killed by double-ought buckshot fired by a policeman in Dixie Hills, of young Andre Moore shot in the back of by Atlanta's finest, and of hundreds of nameless others throughout this region. 
No one will deny that that period did much to eradicate some of the inhuman legal humiliations of previous decades. But no honest person can fail to see that in 1971, Atlanta and the United States will have to undergo radicals changes before the land of the slave can' truly become the home of the free.
Part of the solution to the problem which afflicts us is found inside us; a great part of it is found outside our immediate control.
Outside of our control, for example, is the enormous military-labor-industrial complex which runs this country, and which has its greedy, racist blood-soaked fingers in every decision on foreign and domestice policy made by the government which rules us.
The important factor here is that all these decisions are made pretty much by the same group of people. The same mentality that arms facist governments in Greece and South Vietnam, that approves invasion of peaceful Guinea by mercenaries armed with American and NATO supplied arms, stands foursquare behind police murders at Jackson State Collge

The agent based in Atlanta told of attending a press conference called by the Southern Christian Leadership Conference - with phony press credentials identifying him as a reporter for the Richmond (Va.) Times-Dispatch—and of being assigned to a rally for the Poor People's campaign. During the march and rally, which took place a month after the assassination of the Rev. Martin Luther King, Jr., he was told to keep in constant contact with Ft. Holabird, supplying information on the march.
What dream?
""When Coretta King spoke,"" the agent said. ""she told the audience about how her husband had had a dream and now this dream was going to come true.

Edgar Hoover to spy on those he disagrees with inside the United States.

In a like fashion, we cannot separate our destiny here from the destinies of millions of people of color across the globe. Hundreds of billions of dollars that might have been spent to move this nation toward economic and social justice have been poured into the murder of the people of Southeast Asia, into the gluttonous pockets of the tex-supported monopolistic weapons makers, into the greedy bins of large landowners who consume tax revenues instead of producing food, and into ivory tower bureaucracies that laboriously re-evaluate each other, proposing last year's solutions to the problems of the last three centuries.
Closer to home, it is no secret that real power here has been concentrated in a very few hands. Only last week, former Mayor Ivan Allen revealed that truism when he observed that in 1947 at the age of 36 he was, in his words, ""one of those being chose to eventually take over the leadership of the city.""* Who did this chosing, selecting a 36-year-old white man who had never had any social intercourse with black people to run our lives?Certainly not you and I.
But the people who run this city have for years been choosing for us. They chose the wrong man in the last Mayor's race, but the activities of the last few days doesn't suggest that they did too badly
4
for themselves in the long run.
It should become obvious, then, that an important item on our priority list for the rest of the 1970s ought to be choosing and selecting our own.
This could have been done last November, when Andrew Young missed replacing the tin-horn cheap plastic imitation of Barry Goldwater who passes as our Congressman. Political scientists will argue for years to come why he lost, why 35,000 black people didn't vote, whether his 18% of the white vote could have been greater. The plain facts however, available to all of us; he could have won.
He could have won, for example, if there existed still in this city an organization like the old Negro Voters League, certainly not a carbondn copy, but a city-wide grass-roots organization dedicated to promoting the political interests of the black community.
Quite naturally, one would expect the only geographically and democratically selected leaders in the black community to begin the task of building such a organization, but whoever takes on this task, there are certain rules that must be followed.
Such a group must cast its votes as a single unit. It must declare itself in the interests of laboring people, but must not become the mistress of organized labor. It must pay as much attention to a street light in a 50-foot alley as it does to national legislation involving millions of people, and to international complications involving the future of the world. It must maintain a militance, agressiveness and independence which will assure its followers that it cannot be bought.

If there are is to be any success with such a movement, it must observe certain undeniable facts.
First, that social, economic, educational, political and physical segregation and discrimination fill a very real need for the white majority.
- that appeals to justice and fair play are outmoded and useless when power, financail gain and prestige are at stake.
- that discrimination will be the rule unless change is forced through coercion, threats, power or violence;
- that initiative for black political action must come from within the black community, and must be sustained on a day-by-day basis, and finally, that racial self-interest, race consciousness, and racial solidarity must always be paramount in the words and deeds of black political activists; when self-interest is forgottenn, organized racism will continue to dominate and frustrate the best organized actions of any black political unit, and will leave it powerless and defenseless.
Next on our political agenda must be some means of escaping from the kind of slavish attention we pay to political parties, the kind of foolishness that made us slaves, first to the party of Lincoln, and next to the party of Roosevelt.
For example, Andrew Young could be living in Washington now if he had chosen to run as the candidate for a third party. White votes would have split between the Democratic and Republican nominees, and he could have won that election on the basis of the black votes he received alone.
We ought not be fooled by this token reformism that is going on in this state's Democratic party. They would have you believe it is]

being done voluntarily, that Governor-elect Carter is fulfilling a campaign pledge to bring the party back to the people. The truth is they are being forced to reform the party, and the hidden truth is that the infusion of democratic procedures into an undemocratic structure does not guarantee democracy will result. I predict that black and poor people will have even less to say about party affairs under this new arrangement than these groups had under the 1968 system when the governor dominated the entire selection process.
But whatever method and through whatever device, independent politics has got to be the wave of the future for black people. In Cleveland, Mayor Carl Stokes and his brother, Congressman Louis Stokes, have formed the 21 District Caucus, endorsing and electing Democrats and Republicans alike. At the other end of the spectrum in New York State, James Buckely is now a member of the United States Senate because he saw the virtue of independent politics, and Alabama now has three black sheriffs because and more elected black officials than susposedly more liberal Georgia because they recognize the necessity for independent politics. In South Carolina, an independent, nearly all-black political party will slate a candidate for the seat vacated by the death of Mendel Rivers, whi with an excellent chance of victory.
With a new political organization must come a new political ideology. We must for once an for all abandon the notion that the white man's ice is colder, his medicine stronger, his sugar sweeter. We have to encourage our young people not the follow in the footsteps of the diseased majority culture. The strange phenomenom of Morris Brown College students selling candy to the poverty stricken inhabitants of Vince City so that a band can spend $30,000 to go to California to appear ofn television for a d few seconds ought never to be repeated. That $30,000 could have rebuilt one side all of the houses on one side of one short block of Vine Street, and Morris Brown would have left a lasting monument in its shadow, instead of a flickering image on the screen. The same might be said of the other Atlanta University Center institutions, and all of the institutions - churches, schools, businesses, social and civic clubs - that operate in our community.
And we must remind the same young people, black and white, that the vast majority of black people want concrete, visible, material improvement in their lives. They have no patience with those whose social involvement is limited to the romantic rhetoric of revolution, the enobling sacrifice of self-enforced poverty, or the latest fad that catches the attention of boutique radicals and limosine liberals.
We have to be on guard against sinister forces that attempt to attack us from without, while we guard against decay from within. We ought to be especially alert to the approach of the police state as evidenced by the spy tactics more common in totalitarian states than in this one, and by the petty peversities of the little tyrant who runs the Federal Bureau of Investigation. Acting on concert with the Attorney General, the President, and the gate-mouthed Maryland Farmer who presides over the Senate, a frightening new ear era in American life has been reborn, reminding one of the McCarthyism of the 50s and the political apathy that ran rampant in that period.
Finally, when one makes a speech like this he must realize he is saying old things, describing old situations and some old solutions
8
to an audience that has heard it all before with no more indication of an inclination to action that the expected polite applause at the end. 
Let us all hope that in 1971, unlike all of the other years that have gone before, we can make this year a year of action; action against poverty, racism, creeping facism and war. Severe action against our enemies and warmhearted helpful action toward our friends.
An action which susposes that we would all agree with the credo written by a former Atlantans, a great teacher and leader, and man whose widow will be visiting with our city shortly. His name was W. E. B. DuBois, and in his early years he wrote:
""I be ieve in God who made of one blood all the races that dwell on earth. I believe that all men, black and brown and white are brothers, varying, through time and opportunity, in form and gift and feature, but differing in no essential particular, and alike in soul and in the possibility of infinite development.
""But especially do I believe in the Negro race; in the beauty of its genius, the sweetness of its soul and its strength in that meekness which shall inherit this turbulent earth...
""I believe in the Prince of Peace. I believe that war is murder. I believe that armies and navives are at bottom the tinsel and braggadacio of oppression and wrong, and I believe that the wicked conquest of weaker and darker nations by nations white and stronger but foreshadows the death of that strength.
""I believe in liberty for all men; the space to stretch their arms and their souls, the right to breath and the right to vote, to
9
choose their friends, enjoy the sunshine... uncursed by color, thinking, hoping, dreaming as they will in a kingdom of god and love.""

We could call upon the buying power of our 25 million to stop General Motors. We could cast our “balance of power” votes to elect and defeat Presidents and dogcatchers. We could effectively defend our communities from outside or inside attack and subversion.
However, we are not that together. We are, however, an organized people. We belong—-depending on our level in society—-to a variety of groups.
The last two years have seen a spate of new groupings among all levels of black people. We have seen the rise of Afro-American and Black Student Unions on the college campus, we have seen the Black Caucuses in labor unions, in teacher’s groups, on police forces, in religious bodies and so on.
Welfare recipients have been organizing for three years now. And we have always belonged to a variety of social and civic clubs like the East Side Voters League or the Sassy Ladies Savings and Social Club.
The Democratic Party has tried to organize Black Democratic Officeholders, some of us for some reason have remained loyal to the party which we believed freed the slaves.

So we are in many ways a well organized people. What this paper appeals for is discussion and hopefully the organization of yet another organization, na network of people interested—but not exclusively—in elective politics as a problem solving device for black people.
(The author wishes to state that elective policies and the radical, revolutionary change that we need are incompatible; however, politics can offer us victories and some successes, and ought never be ignored by black people as one weapon in a presently rather empty arsenal.)
The passage of the 1965 Voting Rights Act—which will expire in two months—inspired a great deal of hope among Southern black people. That hope has of course not been realized.
The elections of Richard Hatcher and Carl Stokes and the primary victory of Tom Bradley raised Northern hopes as well. Bradley’s defeat and the victories for the right in Milwaukee and New York have demonstrated how fragile that hope was.
Nearly 400 blacks have been elected to public office in the South. If public offices were distributed on a racial formula, that figure would be more like 2,000.
Once in office, black people, North and South, like Hatcher and Stokes as Mayors of Northern cities and the 14 black state legislators in Georgia and like a Mrs. Geneva Collins, Chancery Clerk in Port Gibson, Mississippi, we often find our best efforts frustrated by their minority position or the complicated nature of the job at hand.
The “organization” this paper proposes will hopefully ease the pre-and post-elective position of black people in the United States.

First, let us examine existing organizations touching on this field. The two major political parties, through their “minority “ offices, will offer minor aid to successful primary candidates of their respective parties.
Other sorts of help are offered by:
The Voter Education Project, Inc.
Five Forsyth Street Northwest
Atlanta, Georgia 30303
a privately funded voter education and registration project, operating in the 13 Deep South states. The VEP is handicapped because it must be non-partisan, and faces the term of Congress losing the foundation support it has enjoyed in the past. The VEP has also begun a series of satellite centers established at Southern Black schools to aid elected officials.
The Scholarship, Education and Defense Fund
New York, N. Y.
an off-shoot of early ‘60’s CORE , SEDFRE does good work training for vote drives and giving expertise to elected blacks with “special” jobs, i.e., school board members.
The Southern Elections Fund
New York, N. Y.
a new effort which intends to give badly needed funds to Democratic, Republican and Independent black candidates in the South, and eventually. across the country. This group hopes to fill a void which neither VEP or SEDFRE fill because of their tax-exempt status.
One might also list SCLC, NAACP, COPE, ADA, The Committee For An Effective Congress, the labor movement, generally, as groups

page four
which generally can be or have been helpful to black political efforts.
None of the above, however, meet a crucial need at present which is to elect good black candidates and to keep them electable by giving them the tools to effect change in their constituencies.
A Richard Hatcher, for instance, may need help in securing federal monies for poverty programs in his cities. Where can he turn for help? A Charles Evers needs an “industry hunter” for Fayette, Mississippi; where can he turn for help? Georgia’s 14 state legislators, paid $5,200 annually and provided with no clerical orroffice space, need administrative assistants, offices, secretaries. Where can they get them?
Or suppose John Roosevelt Williams in Cairo, Illinois, decided he wants to be Mayor there. Where does he turn for information on campaign costs, on registration drives, for research on the issues vital to Cairo?
In each of the cases, you turn to your friends. If you are Charles Evers, you can call upon staff members from the Robert Kennedy campaign to help run your campaign. If you are a black mayor, a Jim Gibson from the Potomac Institute will give you some needed technical assistance. If you are Georgia’s 14 legislators, you look to the VEP and Clark College’s Center for the Study of Southern Public Policy for aid and assistance.
Two kinds of aid are needed in two kinds of ways. Political hopefuls need to know how to get elected, and they need it long before election day. They need, after the election is over and hopefully they have won, information, if they merit it, on how to stay elected. They need, after the process is over, to know how to do the job for which the public has chosen them. They need information on taxes, on municipal bonds, on issues as simple as garbage collection and as complex as the Nigerian conflict, they need a ready source of technical and political information that is not now readily available from any one source.
Julian Bond

1.       There have been attemps to do this last. California State Senator Mervyn Dymally, Illinois State Senator Richard Newhouse, Manhattan Borough President Percy Sutton, Representative John Conyers (D Mich) and several others have attempted to organize black elected officials on a national level.
Rep. Conyers and others, through the National Committee of Inquiry, have attempted to make a strong political force of the black vote in America.
Jack Greenberg and the NAACP Legal Defense Fund have offered research aid for Southern black legislators.
But again, the needed work has not been done.
It can be done, either by strengthening (and perhaps radically altering) the groups mentioned at the beginning of this paper, or by developing new groups and new relationships, by putting together new forms to do a new job.
(Often existing organizations do not do the job because of statutory restrictions which are a part of their funding. Therefore, any frankly political and partisan effort must raise the question of fund sources.)
We want to propose the establishment of a new group which for present purposes will be called ""Negroes and Practical Politics,
Incorporated."" NAPPI will serve to: 1
1. Put black political hopefuls in touch with existing organizations
Julian Bond
June 28, 1969
page six
2. Channel technical pre-election assistance into black campaigns
3. Put technical expertise in a variety of fields into the hands of black officials
(a)     NAPPI will do this by locating and identifying those persons with political expertise and with practical, technical knowledge in a variety of government-related fields.
(b)     NAPPI will establish contact with black community leaders across the land in an attempt to be on top of developing campaigns. This may be done through a variety of ways, through the present elected officials, through church groups, through NAACP contacts, through church groups, through the Black Press, through professional and other associations.
(c)      NAPPI will put persons in category (a) in functioning contact with persons in category (b) .
For example, the Leadership Conference on Civil Rights publishes a bulletin on a regular basis which details what race or poverty connected legislation is at what stage in Washington. This kind of information is vital to a black congressional or mayoral candidate, as well as to the black community as a whole.
For example, the Center for the Study of Southern Public Policy at Clark College in Atlanta is beginning to ""rate"" Georgia legislators, using an ADA-like system. This information is vital to potential legislative candidates in the state, and the idea ought to be duplicated in other locations where black candidates are likely.
Julian Bond
June 28, 1969
page seven
For example, the National Committee for an Effective Congress gives campaign funds to the ""liberal"" House and Senate candidates. NCEI and black Congressional hopefuls ought to get together.
For example, some black (and some white) entertainers have volunteers to raise campaign funds for some black candidates. The entertainers ought to be put in touch with more black hopefuls.
For example, VEP funds voter registration campaigns in the Southern communities. VEP and these communities must be aware of one another.
For example, the National League of Cities articulates pro-urban positions which are on occasion vital to black interests. NAPPI could put Mayor X in touch with them.
For example, there on University campuses, in labor and in business individuals with great expertise in campaigning. One thinks of George Booker, now with the Urban Coalition, or Earl Graves, now with his own consulting firm. NAPPI should put such persons in touch with hopefuls, and should help arrange financing where that is needed. In addition, NAPPI could seek out persons skilled in advertising and the other necessities of successful campaigning.
(d) NAPPI could put the successful candidate in touch with persons, institutions and organizations that can play a helpful role.
First, many of the above examples can be repeated. But to name a few more:
For example, NAPPI could put Mayor Charles Evers in touch with some of the businessmen who are interested in helping the poor black people, and help provide the technical expertise necessary for Fayette, Mississippi to lure an

industry. NAPPI could help the Fayette City Council float bonds, could secure underwriting, and could insure that whatever industry comes would not be exploitive.
Continuing in this vein, surely NAPPI could have helped Mayor Evers make a better choice of training sites for his policeman that Rizzo's Philadelphia.
And for example, NAPPI could act as go-between for black state legislators and city councilmen and the Law Students Civil Rights Research Committee and the Black Law Students Association to recruit, train and fund law students to work with elected officials as aides and assistants.
For example, NAPPI could put any of the authors of the immense numbers of scholarly papers and surveys on a variety of urban and state governmental concerns in contact with the black public officials in a position to put theory into practice.
For final example, NAPPI could insure that no black elected official, whether he is Police Juror in West Feliciana Parish, Louisiana, or Chairman of a Sub-Committee of the United States House of Representatives, goes without the information and resources he needs to do his job.[2]"

That may be true, but it's leaking under Black people's seat. 
You are about to leave here at a time of social and moral turmoil. You are entering into the real world outside of these ebony towers at an interesting time. You are the spiritual descendants of those young people who eleven years ago, coming from schools very much like this one, demonstrated that young people could make a difference, first at lunch counters and bus stations,
2
then at county courthouses and voting booths all over the dark regions of the country. 
Throughout the decade of the Sixties, young people the age most of you are now, faced police dogs and fire hoses and midnight murderers and jails in order to bring a small taste of democracy to this region of the country. 
And over these years, a certain sort of progress occurred.
But, there is always difficulty in measuring what social scientists call ""progress"". This is particularly true of Black people, because we are a people on a see-saw; we go up in one direction and down in another. 
The 1960's were years of one kind of incredible swift movement for us: we moved from social and political slumber into mild activism into open, if short-lived, rebellion. 
Since the beginning of the last half of that decade, we have 
3
struggled through a continuing period of evaluation, attempting to discover not just who we are and where we have come from, but where it is we want to go. 
That is a tall question, and its discussion, particularly among those many, many sympathizers and empathizers of the Black movement, occupies more than the achieving of any goal. 
The trouble is that many people talk about revolution, but do nothing about it: they talk about reform, but do nothing about it. 
We live in an age where social activism is measured by whether one wears the right button or can mouth the latest slogan - even President Nixon can say ""power to the people"".
You are, in a way certified by your graduation today, becoming citizens of the larger world, but of course we are citizens only in the narrow sense in that we must meet certain obligations to the state, without receiving all of the corresponding benefits of citizenship. We all pay taxes, but because more of us are poor, 
4
and because the poor pay more, and because some of the rich pay nothing, we pay more of our share for less of the rewards most taxpayers rightfully expect. 
Black and white young men alike are subjected to the nearly equal opportunity to serve this country militarily, but through this present attack by our country on the innocent people of Southeast Asia, we have managed to become first in war, last in peace, and seldom in the hearts of our countrymen.
While we - like most other Americans - came here as immigrants, but most immigrants came voluntarily, seeking freedom and a chance to survive, our ancestors came in chains, husband torn from wife, child from mother. 
In a land where family and education are venerated, we were denied the chance to learn and to maintain what presently passes for a stable family unit. In a country populated with sufferers
5
religious persecution, we found a strange and alien religion forced upon us. 
While we came from a land whose inhabitants believed in communalism and the extended family, we found created here a system of mercantile capitalism that exactly fitted the cash box mentality of the Founding Fathers. 
From that day to this, the separate status of Black people here has been a fact. From that day to this, we have been the Africans, suffering at the hands of the Europeans. 
The argument is also made that Blacks enjoy legal status here as do all Americans. Of course, on paper, that is largely true. But the plain facts are that certain constitutionally guaranteed rights, like the right to vote and to enjoy other forms of social and political participation, are still subjected to intense debate, not only in the Southern states but even here in Washington, in Uncle
6
Strom's cabin itself. 
In short, we are in bad shape. We live and work in situations provided for by the majority, not by us. We exist at the pleasure and sufferance of the American majority, and the evidence is mounting that that existence itself may soon be called into question. 
Your job is to ignore the foolish preoccupations that have captured the attention of your white contemporaries. You cannot afford to attend a Woodstock while the nation still tolerates Watts. You cannot afford to show more interest in macrobiotic diets, in music, drugs, the relative revisionism of the late Ho Chi Minh, the romantic rhetoric of revolution and the enabling sacrifice of self-enforced poverty than you do in the very real problems of human existence that afflict most Black people in this country.
Your job is to make real the revolutions that are sweeping around us. The first is a revolution in thinking about ourselves, a revolution turning upside down the perverse analysis that has 
7
made us - the victims - describe ourselves as the cause of our condition. 
It is a revolution found most concretely in the growing desire among Black people to reject the kind of trivialization of class and geography that has divided us for so long. And it is found in the impulse to bring us together as a nation within this nation.
It is found in the rejection by Black people of European standards of beauty and qualification that have plagued us for so long. 
Making this real is your job. Your graduation today is supposed to signify your entrance into the world where real decisions are made. 
Since people of color have never been involved in decision making at this level, your role is to continue and heighten the empowerment of Black people begun in the Sixties by young people 
8
like you. 
There can be no denying that the direction Black and poor people must take in the remainder of the 1970s is toward a real and meaningful participation in politics. 
That is because it is politics that decides - in the end - what kind of life each of us will have, what kind of world we live in. what kind of futures our children will have. 
It is politics that sent our sons and brothers and uncles and fathers to Southeast Asia, to shoot and kill and be killed by other mothers' sons in a war made by politicians; it is politics that will bring them back. 
It is politics that decides that unemployment for Black people will remain at two and three times the national average, and it is politics that decides that we will live in a permanent depression, 
9
and it is politics that can put money in our pockets and give us jobs on a livable, not laughable income now. 
It is politics that decides that we must live in second and third hand homes that others have discarded or in verticle prisons of concrete and glass designed by some architect who lives in the suburbs. It is politics that made it impossible for so many of us to earn a living back home, and ran us into the cities to be squeezed together like sardines in a can, and it is politics that will enable us to take over the cities where we live, and turn them into the kinds of places where everyone wants to live and raise their children. 
It is politics that gives our children lead poisoning, and it is politics that has created socialism for Lockheed Aircraft and welfare capitalism for the poor. 
It is politics that makes us the last to be hired and the first to be fired; that gives our kids twelve years of school but only 
10
six years of education; that has made us first in war on the battlefield, but last in peace, and seldom in the hearts of our countrymen. 
Finally, it will be politics that decides whether you get $6,500 a year or $2400; whether mothers of children over six, or over three, are thrown on an already hostile and overcrowded job market or whether they will have the choice their middle class contemporaries have: to work if they choose, or stay home and take care of the youngsters, if they choose.
But the kind of politics that has done these things to us is not the kind of politics that we must play; our politics must be different and new. 
The kinds of politics that have been played on us must not be played by us. This doesn't mean that we must be soft or say no when we want to say yes; it only means that other people's dirty tricks 
11
are not for us. 
The kind of politics we have suffered from has been the art of compromise and the art of the possible. That means that unless we compromise, everything is impossible. 
Our politics has got to be a new art , the art of seeing who gets how much of what from whom. 
The Black and the poor are the who who haven't been getting any of anything from you know who.
Together, we have got to play this new politics for our benefit. As Congressman Clay of Missouri says so well, ""We have no permanent friends, no permanent enemies, only permanent interests."" 
The immediate task of the American underclass right now, especially between now and November, 1972, is to organize. When you return to your homes, spread the word that a people together are a strong people, while a people apart will stumble and fall. 
12
Hopefully, this country will choose a new president in 1972. And you have got to be prepared to have something to say about who he or she will be. 
Of course, you don't have to be involved in politics if you don't want to. If you want the people who have been running your business for 352 years to keep on doing it, they'll be glad to do it. They like doing it. They love doing it. They've gotten fat and sassy and rich doing it, while we've only gotten the kind of fat that comes from not eating properly. It's now time for us to get sassy, too. 
They've been doing it for so long that they think God himself ordained in his heaven for them to do it. After 352 years of sticking their fingers into other peoples' pies, here and all around the world, and pulling up all the plums for themselves, they must be tired. They ought to be tired of doing it by now, so let's get together and give them some rest. 
13
We must decide now whether we want four more years of Nixon-Agnewism, four more years of five-o'clock shadow and half-past promises, of the gate-mouthed Maryland farmer, or whether now we're about the business of putting of them out of business. 
As trained and educated persons, you ought to aspire to a leadership role in the politics of your respective communities. 
It is only going to be with your help, your aid, your assistance and your sacrifice that we shall see whether the land of the slave will ever become the home of the free. 
The choice is yours. 
If someone tells you that politics is useless, tell them that's because the wrong people have been using politics to use too many of us for too many years. 
A few weeks ago, Vice-President Agnew suggested that some of us ought to imitate African leaders like Jomo Kenyatta. It is 
14
significant that he chose a country that fits his politics perfectly - fascist Spain - for these remarks. Well, if he wants us to imitate Jomo Kenyatta, and if he wants to keep on playing ""white settler"", a lot of us are ready to begin playing Mau Mau. 
None of us should believe that the future is rosy. Just this week, the Census Bureau and the Department of Labor Statistics released figures demonstrating that for every three steps forward we take, we take at least two backward. Income for Black people over the past ten years increased, their report said, but our income is still only three-fifths what white people earn. More Black people than ever before are finishing college, but we are still more likely than whites to drop out of high school. Housing for Black people has improved over the last decade, but nearly half of the rural housing for Blacks is still substandard. Life expectancy for us is still less than that for white. 
15
But, no one has to recite these dreary figures for us. They have been a part of daily life for too many of us for too many years.
The time has long passed for us to take care of business, to seek political solutions to the political problems that plague us. 
You can make the difference, a difference that will determine whether or not you have been majoring in Boone's farm and minoring in Bid Whist. 
You must believe, as Frederick Douglass did 100 years ago, that ""Men may not get all they pay for in this world, but they certainly pay for all they get. If we ever get free from the oppression and wrong that has been heaped upon us, we must pay for their removal. We must do this by our labor, by our sacrifice, by our suffering, and if need by, by our lives and the lives of others."" "

a listing of vital issues. 35% of the students surveyed said that racial equality had them ""very worried."" It has me ""very worried"" too.  45% were just plain ""worried"" and 20% were ""not worried"" at all. 
If the survey is true, and I believe it is, it says something about this group of people, their parents, and their education. It also suggests something frightening about the possibility of alleviating - with their help - the great problem of the twentieth century. 
One supposes that almost every literate American by now recognizes the gravity of the situation in which Black people find ourselves today. The urgent question for us is not ""what is wrong?"" but rather it is ""what are we going to do is to be done about it?"" The problem has of course been studied, surveyed and commissioned a great deal, but most of these groups, made up of last year's problem solvers, are recommending last decade's solutions to a problem that has been with us since the first Black people were dragged to these shores a year before the Mayflower 
3
arrived.
Presidents have tried New Frontiers, Great Societies, and now, the New Federalism. The officials of the Nixon Administration say that ""benign neglect"" is the best approach. In other words, they say we can make progress go forward faster if we do nothing, and this administration is attempting to prove that thesis by doing less than nothing. 
""Nothing"", in this instance, means a refusal to fund new programs for the poor; Nixon castrates the old programs and reduces the little funding they had. ""Nothing"" means failure to take steps to protect Black people from police brutality and the police state tactics employed by policemen to make legal the standard practice of no-knock and preventative detention that have been the staples of repressive law enforcement since the beginning of recorded time: Nixon increases and makes legal the brutality. ""Nothing"" means no new 
 
4
efforts to provide medical care and education and housing; Nixon vetoes the token legislation proposed by others. ""Nothing"" means no increase in federal efforts to protect Southern voting rights; Nixon attempts to destroy the 1965 Voting Rights Act and Congress penalizes foundations which finance voter registration. ""Nothing"" means the failure to push for the desegregation of Southern school systems; Nixon's Department of Injustice fights court battles for Southern racists, for the first time presenting the sorry spectacle of the Attorney General of the United States and the Atty General of Mississippi arguing on the same side.

President Nixon has allowed school bussing to become an emotional issue; argued over by both Black and white parents and students. The plain facts are that bussi forced bussing to achieve racial balance is not part of a new conspiracy hatched in R Peking, but an old, old story for American black people. I dare say there is not a are few Black persons in this country over 35 who was were not at one time in his their educational lives bussed past some white school to attend a black school, to insure that racial balance - 100% white students in one school and 100% Black students in another - was maintained. 
Who complained then when these little Black bodies were being transported mi 50 to 100 miles a day, in some instances, down the public highway? 
We heard no complaints from the governors of the Southern states; no protests from angry white parents in Pontiac, Michigan, no outcry at all. 
When the bodies in the bus were Black and the schools they were bussed to were Black - that's racial balance of the kind President Nixon knows best - bussing was a non-issue. 
As long as peo bussing doesn't cover too great a distance, and as long as it follows the pattern of the American highway system - two-way - there's absolutely nothing wrong with it. 
""Nothing,"" then, for the present government in Washington means adopting and catering to the worst of the national mood, a mood which suggests that Black people and the problems we are afflicted with will ha will somehow go away. 
That is why the vice-president chooses the country mo European  country most like his own politics - Facist Spain - to tell the Black leadership of the United State they complain too much. Mr Agnew has urged American Blacks to emulate and imitate Jomo Kenyatta. Well, if he wants to continue playing white settler, many of us are past beginning to play Mau-Mau. 
It requires the no complaint to take a quick look at all of the facts and figures that measure how well, or how poorly, a group of people are doing -- the kinds of statistics that measure infant mortality, unemployment, median family income, life expectancy -- they demonstrates quite clearly that the average Black American, while better off than his father was, is actually worse off when his statistics are measured against similar ones
5
for white people.
When a Black child is born, his chance of dying in his first year is double that for a child born outside the ghetto. His chance of being mentally retarded is twice the community average. His chances of graduating from high school are three out of ten; when he does graduate, there is a fifty-fifty chance he will have the equivalent of an eighth grade education. Despite the progress claimed by Daniel Patrick Moynihan the administration, the Department of Labor said a short while ago: ""Economic and social conditions are getting worse, not better, in the ghetto.""
Unemployment among Black people in some parts of the country is 40%, and that, even before ""benign neglect."" If that figure were true for the general population, there would be 30 million Americans out of work. Among those Black men with jobs, more than a fourth earn less than $60 a week, or less than a family of four needs to 
6
eat 70 cents worth of food a day. 
It is as though Black Americans are climbing a molasses mountain in snowshoes, while white people are riding a ski lift to the top.
It is these depressing figures, and the accompanying pathology which results from them, that causes so much discontent and depression is Black communities today.

But many - not all by any means - but many of these problems are susceptible to political solutions, a difficult task for a people who constitute little more than 11% of the national population. 
What we need is a community of interest which will join with us in building political muscle to tackle the job ahead. 
Now the 26th Amendment to the Constitution has enfranchised 11.4 million young people, including 1.2 million in college away from home who presumably reflect the sentiments expressed in the Playboy survey. 
If Black people are to seek political solutions to the problems that plague us, then surely we need a more ""worried"" group than this. 
We need, in fact, an alliance first with ourselves, and then other persons of color, then with the great bulk of the American poor who share some of our circumstances if not our total condition, 
7
and then with these new enfranchisees.

In these alliances we need to be guided by the maxim of Rep. Bill Clay of Missouri, who knows so well, ""We have no permanent friends, no permanent enemies, only permanent interests."" 
But those people -- white, Black, young or old -- who will admit -- to Playboy or themselves -- to being ""very worried"" about race relations and the attendant pathologies that afflict the poor have a role to play as well. 
They can join the growing movement drive to attempt in an organized fashion to build a movement in this country between now and November, 1972, that will not just dis-elect Richard Nixon and several hundred Congressmen, but will also replace them with people who are ""very worried"" about race. 
It is not too soon to begin now. In fact, it is nearly too late. The process is difficult and easy at the same time. It involves involving yourself in politics, my profession, the second older profession in the world. 
Your first difficulty will be dealing with those who will tell 
8
you that politics is useless and accomplishes nothing. These are, incidentally, the same people who in 1968 would have told you that Richard Nixon's election was a good thing, because it would heighten the contradictions and hasten the revolution. That's fine in theory, but it's Black people's contradictions that are being heightened, not theirs. These are the spiritual descendants of the people who in Germany in the 1930s urged the election of Adolph Hitler for the same reason. 
Politics is not the art of the possible, as you may have been taught, or even the art of the compromise, but a much more exciting art -- the art of seeing who gets how much of what from whom. 
We, of course, are the who who haven't gotten any of anything from you know who. 
Politics is what has decided that some mother's sons have to 
9
travel thousands of miles to shoot and kill or be killed by other mother's sons, and politics is what will bring them back. 
Politics is what decides how much money you make, or whether you have a job at all. Politics is what decides whether welfare will be warfare warfare or wilfare, and whether people or Lockheed Aircraft can get government subsidies. Politics is what decides whether the United States will continue capitalism for the poor and socialism for the rich, and politics is what decides that men on the moon have priority over little children on Earth, and that Saigon is more important than Selma. 
Politics made the air you breath dirty, and it can make it clean. Politics nastied your water, and politics can make it clear. Politics decides -- and it will decide for you. It has been deciding with you. The question is, will it decide without you.
If there is anyone anywhere on this earth who believes that 
10
it makes no difference who is President in this country, ask yourself these questions. Who nominated Carswell and Haynesworth to the Supreme Court? Who made John Mitchell the Attorney General of the United States? Whose Department of Justice allowed murder to go unpunished at San Quentin, at Jackson State, at Kent State? , at Orangeburg? Who gave the Cinderella Bridegroom from South Carolina, Strom Thurmond, veto power over judicial appointees and school integration decisions? Whose Secretary of Defense says that the war against the Vietnamese people may end but American soldiers will be in Vietnam for many years to come? Who is afraid of the Hillbilly Hitler from Alabama? Who was it who made the gate-mouthed Maryland farmer the Vice President of the United States? Who was that man? 
And who were the people who let him do these things? With some exceptions, it was the Congress of the United States, the representatives whose terms expire every two years, and the senators whose
11
terms expire every six.
You should check yours out. They may be perfect men. If they are not, don't just check them out, kick them out.

[Red line.]
There's not going to be just one Black candidate for the Presidency, in 1972, but 5 or 6 or more. 
These will be locally based Black candidates, well known in their respective states, chosen by consensus among Black political activists in their states. 
These Blacks will run as ""favorite sons or daughters"" in their home states, where they are well known, and not 1,000s of miles from home. 
They will aid the election of independent Black delegates, responsive to the Black community, and not bound to organized labor and not and as hand-servants of any of the regular candidates.
Their candidacies will say to those who want the Black vote in '72 - as well as those who think that vote can be bought or sold or belongs to them through habit or custom, that the Black vote in 1972 belongs to the candidate Black or white, who delivers to Black people in dollars and cents in jobs and education and homes and peace. 
[Red line.]
These unselfish candidates, and the coalition of Black political activists who will support them, will invigorate the politics of Black communities across this nation, laying the ground-work for Black political parity, Black and the political independence of the Black community from alien and hostile forces.

That is the hard job, putting people in proper relationship to the forces that control their lives. That is what starts lives wars; that is what ends them.

Remember, if you will, some other words from the past, from the great abolitionist Frederick Douglass, who said:
""If there is no struggle, there is no progress. Those who profess to favor freedom and yet depreciate agitation are men who want crops without plowing up the ground. They want the rain without thunder and lightning. They want the ocean without the awful roar of her mighty waters. The struggle may be a physical one, and it may be a moral one, or it may be both moral and physical, but there must be a struggle. Power concedes nothing without a demand. It never has, and it never will.....""

100 years later, when race and economics are still the reason why men fight in Vietnam, babies starve in Harlem, joblessness for Black young people is three times the figures for whites, Dr. DuBois's prediction has come true.
100 years after his prediction, Playboy magazine has commissioned a poll to discover how the flower of American youth feel about the pressing issues of the day, indeed to discover what issues - if any - are pressing to them at all.
Their survey ominously begins with the notation that college heroes have gone from Mario Savio and Bobby Dylan half a decade ago to Howdy Doody and Buffalo Bob today.

Crossing the Color Line:
R & B and Birth of Rock 'n' Roll
by Julian Bond
I am the grandson of a slave. Today I teach at the University of Virginia, founded by slave-owner Thomas Jefferson, teaching young Americans about the modern day struggle for liberty that drew more inspiration from Jefferson's words than his deeds. So may we today. Jefferson once said ""Music is the passion of my soul."" It is my passion to, and if it is not yours, your soul - indeed your life - is poorer for it. My passion, I ought to add, is entirely as part of popular music's vast audience; I can't read a note a note or carry a tune or dance a step. What I bring to this presentation is a lifetime of listening, humming, whistling, attempts at singing, rocking, rolling, swaying and clapping. [Handwritten mark in the right margin.]
I sat on Paul Robeson's knee as he sang ""The Four Insurgent Generals."" I watched ""Bandstand"" before Dick Clark took it over. I watched Mrs. Morris, from Detroit, lead her young son Steveland, better known later as Stevie Wonder, onto the stage of the Royal Peacock on Atlanta's Auburn Avenue. I heard Ray Charles ""Drown in his Own Tears"" in Atlanta's Herndon Stadium and I wrote a poem about it that appears as liner notes on a Ray
2
Charles album. I've seen entertainers walk the tables at the Magnolia Ballroom and I've done the slow drag at blue light parties; I saw Hank Ballard sing ""Work With Me Annie"" and I saw him dance the and sing the ""Twist"" before a young boy in Philadelphia changed his name from Ernest Evans to Chubby Checker. I'm qualified.
I want to begin with a musical introduction from the 1970s, nearly twenty years after the melding of musics into rock 'n' roll. It is instruction to you, and it comes from Harold Melvin and the Blue Notes. The lead singer is Teddy Pendergrast. Here is:
Up, Everybody - 1.23
The Encyclopedia of Southern Culture describes rock 'n' roll thusly:
""Rock 'n' roll is the generic term used to describe the dominant strain of American popular music from 1955 to 1965. In general, rock 'n' roll was teenage-oriented dance music that synthesized elements of black and white folk and popular music styles, specifically and most conspicuously, rhythm and blues and country (or 'hillbilly') music.""1
In Hope and History, Vincent Harding suggests that the study of African-American arts offers the chance ""to reflect on the role of the artist as a democratic teacher, or to explore the inner relationships that tend to exist among such significant elements as these: the revival of popular participation in the political process, the opening of new, creative vistas in the
3
arts, and the inevitable emergence of unheralded creator-warriors who arrive from unexpected places...and mount, astonishing, often frightening assaults on the traditional definitions of reality.""
""In other words, a narrow 'civil rights' approach may have led many persons of every age group to miss the possibility that the study of artists and their work can be more enjoyable, exciting, and fundamental to the creation of a more just and democratic society.""2
This is a history of the interplay of the musics of black and white Americans, mostly Southerners and mostly working class; the influence of these ""outsiders"" on American culture, and their ability to shape and alter it as America struggled to create a more just and democratic society.
Rock 'n' roll's history is American history - as in all American history, race is central, but many forces contribute to rock 'n' roll's birth.
In The Seventh Stream; The Emergence of Rock 'n' Roll in American Popular Music, Philip H. Ennis argues that there were six commercial currents - three dominant, three smaller - in American music by the beginning of the 20th century. The larger streams were: ""Pop, the commercial music of the nation;"" ""Black Pop"", the popular music of black Americans;"" and ""Country Pop,...the popular music of the American white South and Southwest"". The smaller streams were jazz, folk and gospel. He argues that these streams coincided to produce the seventh stream, rock 'n' roll.3
4
In this discussion, ""Pop"" is the music of vaudeville and Broadway and later, movies, ranging from dance bands to individual performers. ""Black Pop"" is all Afro-American popular forms, and also ranges from large bands to individuals, and until 1948, was called ""race music.""
""Country Pop"" is music sung and played almost exclusively by Southern whites or Southern white migrants to white audiences."" ""Jazz"", initially created by blacks in New Orleans, migrated to Texas, Chicago and New York. ""Folk"" was the ""music of the poor and oppressed"", and ""Gospel"" was 20th Century American religious vocal music.4
In this period, sheet music ""constituted the largest source of income for American popular music.""5
Examining the history of rock 'n' roll is to examine war; invention; regulatory action; struggles among capitalists and by labor against capital; immigration and migration; musical history; economic shifts; and the discovery and creation of new segments of our national population. Each of these contributes to the narrative, and taken together with the facts and myths and legends, makes up the story of rock 'n' roll. That study informs us about who we are and what we are made of.
In 1938, a fifteen-year-old white boy from rural Alabama who had been taught to play the guitar by an itinerant black musician, won an amateur contest at the Empire Theater in Montgomery, Alabama. Seventeen years later, at a bus stop just outside the theater ticket window, a black woman was arrested for
5
refusing to give up her bus seat to a white passenger. Rock 'n' roll was named in the early 1950s, and had been formed by the middle of the mid-century decade, but its origins lie in the years before, between Hank Williams amateur contest victory in 1938 and Rosa Parks' arrest in 1955, and particularly in the World War II years which affected so much else in American life.
Even before the War began, dramatic structural changes in the music business opened the door for the eventual birth of rock 'n' roll. Let me mention - quickly - just a few, before we begin to hear the people who made the music and the music they made - ultimately the most important part of this history.
The decade of the '30s saw enormous increases in the number of radio sets in American homes, up by 10% each year. By 1940, 28.5 million of the 35 million household in America had at least one radio set. Figures for blacks from the 1930 Census paint a different picture - only 14% of urban blacks, 3% of rural non-farm blacks and only .3% of rural farming blacks had radios. But these numbers would grow.
The number of radio stations was increasing too. ""By 1940, about 90% of cities with populations over 50,000 had at least one radio station, and most had anywhere from 2 to 7 stations.""6
When Prohibition ended in 1933, the automatic coin music machine - the juke box - rebounded with the reopening of bars. Twenty-five thousand jukeboxes operated in 1934. By 1940, there were 500,000. Their appetite for records was great, and they appeared in new places - ice cream parlors, skating rinks, and
6
bowling alleys, bringing popular music to anyone who had a nickel.
(This 1947 Wurlitzer ad shows Mom, Dad, the kids and even Grandad enjoying juke box music.)
In 1938, the American Federation of Musicians negotiated an agreement with radio network affiliates and independent stations that forced the stations to increase spending on staff musicians.
But over 150 smaller stations were exempt - half of all non-network stations, almost one-quarter of all 700 AM stations, were freed from being required to use live music. Most responded by developing programming which featured popular records with local advertising, all of it held together by a personable staff announcer, who, in later years, would gain a new name - disc jockey.
In 1940, band leader Paul Whiteman lost a lawsuit charging that a radio station had played his music without permission. His defeat meant stations were free to play what they wanted with little actual cost, forcing them into a closer relationship with record companies and record distributors and increasing air time for recorded music.
A late 1930s fight among the American Society of Composers, Authors and Publishers (ASCAP), Broadcast Music Incorporated (BMI) and radio stations temporarily ended in 1940. Two results were that live and recorded performances and performances on network and independent stations were rewarded. ASCAP's profit distribution formula favored its older and established members;
7
BMI was formed in 1939 and had no old or established members; it encouraged the creation of new songs, and the search for new material tilted toward new sources, among them the music of black and white Southerners - country music and blues.
Until then, network stations made hit records, but now smaller stations gained the ability to make a hit - a small station could plug a record, and this process, in turn, made the phonograph record the common unit in American popular music, supplanting sheet music. One result was that the performance of the music, not the written, notated song itself, became the currency of the music business, and individualized performances - of a country song, for example - could become a pop hit.
In July, 1940, the nation's premier music newspaper, Billboard, recognized the growing importance of records - it began a ""Music Popularity Chart"", listing the popularity of record retail sales and juke box plays.
Finally, BMI developed a sophisticated system of surveying every radio station in America, demonstrating regional and localized tastes, thereby moving popular music's center away from New York and Hollywood, into every city, opening the popular music stream to resources beyond those found on New York's Tin Pan Alley.
When Franklin Roosevelt won his second term in 1936, most newspapers opposed him, and many of them also owned radio stations. He decided to get even. In 1941, the Federal Communication Commission ordered the break-up of radio
8
monopolies. NBC had to sell its Blue Network, and both NBC and CBS were forced to divide the broadcast day into four periods. Their control of the evening, prime-time hours was protected, but network control of morning and afternoon hours was withdrawn, freeing them for local programming. NBC and CBS were also forced to sell their talent agencies, and these now-independent bookers and promoters, no longer tied to a New York-Hollywood based broadcast perspective, set their sights nationally, representing and placing entertainers across the nation.
At World War II's end, many network radio affiliates dropped the networks' soap operas and replaced them with phonograph records.
Wartime military service had heightened the gap between America's generations, predicting the later celebration of a youth culture in the 1950s. It was ""our boys"" in uniform, ""just out of high school"" and the ""girls"" they left behind.
Newspapers carried stories about the bad behavior of some of the youth left behind on the home front, stories about juvenile delinquency and ""zoot suit riots"" and ""victory girls"". At Mademoiselle magazine, a new market category was introduced - ""teenagers"" - to identify a class of consumers separate from the ""juniors."" After the War, that designation would become part of the American reality.
If World War II's Armed Services remained segregated by race, they were integrated geographically - whites from Manhattan and Mobile and blacks from Baltimore and Biloxi were together -
9
segregated - in shared barracks, canteens and bars, where northern and western and southern music was shared too. Service in the segregated military sometimes mixed men and music.
White Atlanta disc jockey Zenas Sears remembered his military service. ""I knew something about black music, jazz, when I went to college. But it was not until I went to the army and was assigned to Armed Forces Radio, in the middle of the jungle, that I learned there is a subculture; blues and gospel. I ran a station in India where there were 85 - 90% black troops. I was playing regular Bing Crosby, Mills Brothers and stuff like that. And they sent delegates from these companies saying, 'We don't want to hear that. Mills Brothers is ok. But where is the blues? Where is Dinah Washington and Louis Jordan?""7
The war-time migration of blacks from rural South to urban North and West repeated earlier patterns from the first migration in the early 20th Century. Between 1940 and 1950, 2,659,237 Southerners left the region, 1,044,509 of whom were black.8 All of these migrants - like those before them - took their music with them; once relocated, they became an audience for it in bars and nightclubs and in their own homes.
Among blacks, earlier generations of migrants had created new communities. In them, the new arrivals found, nurtured and created institutions that would help prepare their children for a different and better life - perhaps even lives as professional musicians. Increased exposure to charm, dance and music schools and music instruction in public schools helped to create a
10
greater consciousness of music's possibilities, both as art and occupation.
In August, 1942, the American Federation of Musicians, fearful that recorded music would put musicians out of business, ordered a recording ban until record companies agreed to pay royalties. By 1944, the union prevailed. Many companies stockpiled records, but because the ban affected instrumental recordings only, vocalists and small groups were allowed to record, hastening the ascendancy of singers and the decline of big bands.
Changing tastes during the war years saw singers become more prominent as bands faced harder times. Many musicians were drafted. Tires and gasoline were rationed during the war and expensive afterward, making touring difficult. In December, 1946, the big bands of Benny Goodman, Woody Herman, Benny Carter, Tommy Dorsey, Les Brown, Ina Ray Hutton, Harry James and Jack Teagarden all closed down.
World War I had stopped development of commercial radio, which boomed after the war; World War II stopped development of television, giving radio a longer lease on life.
(In this 1945 ad, each member of the family - Mother, Jim back from the War, Sis and Dad - each wants and expects his or her own radio, giving each control over their own music.)
The War's plunder enabled the recording industry to simplify and become more democratic. Tape recorders, a German invention, were brought back to the United States during the War, the design
11
declassified in 1945, and the recorders went into manufacture here at war's end. The ease of tape over vinyl would make it possible for entrepreneurs with little capital to enter the record business.
The placement of jukeboxes in new locations, and the the War's migrations creating new audiences helped to encourage the popularity of country and black music, and Billboard reported both - then called ""hillbilly"" and ""race"" music - were receiving dramatic increases in jukebox play across the nation, proof that the South's greatest export remained its people and their culture.
""Hillbilly"" music was recognized by Billboard in February, 1942 with the introduction of a column ""American Folk Records"" which promised to report on ""Cowboy songs, Hillbilly tunes (and) Spirituals.""
On October 24, 1942, Billboard acknowledged the growth of ""race"" music by establishing the ""Harlem Hit Parade"", listing the ten most popular records sold in Harlem record stores, and later, in other Harlems across the country.
When the Federal Communications Commission had stopped issuing radio licenses in 1940, there were 813 stations. In the first few years after the War, the number more than doubled - from 943 in 1945 to 2127 in 1949. Fastest growing were the independents, precisely the type permitted - indeed, encouraged to program records.
War-time newsprint shortages shifted advertising dollars
12
from newspapers to radio. Advertising budgets rose 300% from 1940 to 1955 - from $157 million to $492 million. Local radio advertising grew and someone was needed to persuade local merchants to sell their products over the air. That someone was the disc jockey, an intimate, familiar, personable and accessible voice and personality.
As the new and growing medium of television slowly began to fill the evening hours, AM radio filled the day, and filled it with recorded music. The post-war number of new stations meant fewer listeners per station and greater competition for on-air salesmen's personalities.
A 1947 study, Radio Listening in America, demonstrated to the industry that musical preference depended more on age than education. Majorities of 21 to 29 years olds and 30 to 49 year olds, regardless of education, preferred popular and dance music; semi-classical and classical music commanded majorities of college educated listeners only; and hillbilly and western music enjoyed average highs of 37% among grade school graduates and even lower listener levels among high school and college graduates.9
For a station that wanted the largest audience, programming popular music was the wisest choice, and the disc jockey who could attract and hold that audience, selling his sponsor's product and the industry's records, was a prize.
In 1948, record player buyers were offered two new choices,
13
the 33 1/3 revolutions per minute (rpm) long-playing record and the vinyl 45 rpm record to compete with the long established shellac-based 78 rpm.
(78 records looked like this; the new 33s were this size, and 45s smaller.)
CBS, which owned Columbia Records, promoted the 33 1/3; RCA, which owned NBC and Victor Records, promoted the 45, and RCA offered high and low cost systems for playing them.
A $600 radio-phonograph, designed to look like a piece of living room furniture, would play all three speeds; a $12.95 plastic player would only play 45s.
The costs of these systems dictated further segmentation of the record buying public. The longer playing record was especially suited for classical music. Young people who had begun listening to disc jockeys could not afford and did not want the more costly players. Their exposure was to the shorter, single, popular song, and this new, affordable, portable player played their choice - one song at a time. Like their players, 45rpm records were portable too. The large hole made carrying them simpler; their relative unbreakability made thumbing through them easier.
After World War II, Nashville became the production center for country music, with ""a performance site, the Grand Ole Opry; a radio station, WSM, with its recording studio; and a publishing house.""10
Its Music Row soon attracted major publishers, record
14
companies and studios. Six hundred and fifty radio stations broadcast live country music and country artists toured nationwide. Country music was a small but stable stream with strong support from the music industry, especially the major record companies.
""From 1946 to 1953, Billboard's annual listing of each year's top 20 best selling country records showed that only 7 were from independent(s) (record companies), less than 5% of the total.""11
If country pop was alive and well, one tributary of the black pop stream - rhythm 'n' blues - was less hale and hearty. Rhythm 'n' blues' post-war history is the story of independent record companies, black and white disc jockeys and black audience programming from independent radio stations.
In The Death of Rhythm 'n' Blues, Nelson George lists 28 independent R&B record companies formed between 1942 and 1952. Nine of these new companies were in Los Angeles, formed to cater to the tastes of the War's migrants from the South. Only 10 of the 28 were Southern based, but almost all of the independents fished the South's rich pool of talent for the artists they would record. Of Billboard's fifty best-selling rhythm 'n' blues records between 1949 and 1953, only 8% were from major labels.""12
Anyone with $1000 - the cost of producing 500 copies of a record - could open a company, and in rhythm 'n' blues, a single record was the basic unit.
Black audience radio - programming directed at black
15
audiences - boomed after the War.
Sponsor magazine estimated that the greatest growth in black audience radio programming took place between 1949 and 1954 - when the number of stations ""beaming all or part of their programs specifically to Negroes"" increased 1000 per cent.""13
St. Louis' KXLW, Atlanta's WERD, Louisville's WLOU, Memphis' WDIA, Los Angeles KRKD, New Orleans' WYLD, Miami's WMBM, Nashville's WLAC and others all programmed rhythm 'n' blues as well as gospel and jazz.
One of the most important of these was Memphis' WDIA, opened in 1949. Its programming was jazz, gospel and every style of black popular music, and by 1955, it was ""the most powerful voice of the black community in the region, if not the nation.""14 Its success bred imitators in Memphis, a pattern repeated elsewhere.
In 1949, when WDIA was still a sunrise-to-sunset station, rival WHBQ hired white disc jockey Dewey Philips to attract a nighttime black audience. It soon became clear that Philips' personality and the black music he played was attracting a large audience of white teenagers. Philips had counterparts across America, both white and, in growing numbers, black disc jockeys playing and promoting rhythm 'n' blues music, most aiming at black listeners but captivating more and more young whites.
By 1955, more than 600 stations were programming to black communities, large and small, in 39 states, with 36 stations devoting their entire schedules to black oriented material, either rhythm 'n' blues or gospel.
16
""Rhythm 'n' blues,"" Amiri Baraka wrote, ""not only reflected that stream of music that had been city blues and was a further development of the growing urban tradition, it also reflected a great deal about the America it came out of and the Negroes who sang or listened to it. Certainly the war years had brought about profound changes in the cultural consciousness of Negroes, as they had done to the superstructure of American culture as a whole. There was a kind of frenzy and extra-local vulgarity to rhythm 'n' blues that had never been present in older blues forms. Suddenly, it was as if a great deal of the Euro-American humanist facade Afro-American music had taken on had been washed away by the war. Rhythm 'n' blues singers literally had to shout to be heard above the clanging and strumming of the various electrified instruments and the churning rhythm sections. And somehow the louder the instrumental accompaniment and the more harshly screamed the singing, the more expressive the music was.""15
To understand the music's appeal to young whites we must understand who they were and what the music meant to them.
They were ""teenagers"", a term in general usage only since 1945, and then only in the United States. Before circa 1935, American teenagers considered themselves, and were considered, to be young adults, and not a specific group.16
Post war affluence made them the first American generation of young people with money to spend without having to work and the freedom to reject parental values and discover cultural forms
17
of their own. Like other white Americans before and after them, many were influenced by and some adopted aspects of the minority sub-culture - coded speech as in the internal rhymes and inverted meanings of the jazz hipster, oppositional uniforms like the draped, broad shouldered jackets and wide-kneed and narrow-cuffed slacks of the pachuco. They all faced a culture of conformity, and black music over the radio - listened to in secret, shared with a small circle of friends - offered an alternative to acquiescence to adult norms.
The music was forbidden and from a forbidden people; it was more overtly sexual, and was therefore more attractive than the bland, sweet sounds that had sent their fathers off to war or the sensitive love songs that comforted their mothers while dad was away.
The War years had transformed American culture and the American music business; both were more democratic, more open to outsiders.
American music was changing too; listening to it is always preferable to talking about it. As we listen, remember that it was music made by outsiders - migrants from the rural to the urban South, and from the South to the North, Mid-West and West.
It was recorded by companies formed by earlier migrants or immigrants, many of the latter Jews - all of them outsiders to America.
The songs you are going to hear come from a list in a wonderful book called: What Was The First Rock 'N' Roll Record.17
18
Neither its authors nor I contend this is the only list anyone can assemble. These songs do, however, offer demonstrations of the convergence of the six musical streams into the seventh stream - rock 'n' roll.
In June, 1943, drunken servicemen rampaged for seven days through the Los Angeles barrio, beating up Hispanic youths and tearing off their zoot suits, and in July, 1944, a young promoter named Norman Granz held a benefit jazz concert at Los Angeles' Philharmonic Hall to raise money for latinos jailed during the violence.
That concert produced a record that had a profound influence on popular music. It was one of the first ""live"" recordings. Two of the jazz players on this record would become popular stars.
The pianist, who already had two rhythm 'n' blues hits, was Nathaniel Adams Cole, born in Montgomery, Alabama whose family had migrated while he was still young to Chicago. Under contract to Capitol Records, he signed his name Slim Nadine, using his wife's first name as his last. Cole's regular guitarist could not appear, so the pianist asked Les Paul to sit is. Paul was in the Army and not allowed to record; he too used a pseudonym - Paul Leslie.
But the star was Jean-Battiste Illinois Jacquet, born in 1931 in Louisiana and raised in Houston. He had moved to Los Angeles in 1941 and had played for Lionel Hampton and Cab Calloway. His playing on this record elevated the honking and squealing style of saxophone playing that would become a stable
19
of rhythm 'n' blues and later rock 'n' roll. Here is:
Blues, Part 1 - .35
When jazz and swing bands had collapsed at the end of the War, many of their musicians sought employment with other forms of music. Johnny Otis, a white drummer from Berkeley, California, remembered the choices he faced. He said:
""'Round '47 jobs became extremely scarce for big bands. I remember meeting Billy Eckstine during a date in Washington, DC. We bemoaned the fact that we were both 'too late' with big bands.…When I put together a new group I was still thinking of brass section, reed section, so I used two saxes, trumpet and trombone, and piano/bass/drums/guitar. This became the standard rhythm 'n' blues ensemble... Watching the records that were making it - like my friends T. Bone Walker, Roy Milton, Joe Liggins and the Honeydrippers, Charles Brown with Johnny Moore's Blazers - we began to develop something with something. It was a hybrid form that wasn't country blues. It was what was to become known as rhythm 'n' blues, a hybrid form that became an art form in itself. It was the foundation of rock 'n' roll.""18
In 1945, one of the groups Otis mentioned, Joe Liggins and the Honeydrippers, had an R&B number 1 hit for 18 weeks; it placed as high as # 13 on the pop charts too. Liggins was a migrant from Oklahoma, who, by 1942 was playing in Los Angeles clubs.
The song was ""The Honeydripper"", and it was more than one of the first hits in the rhythm 'n' blues small combo style; its
20
success also encouraged the post-war independent record company industry. Liggins' song was recorded and distributed by Los Angeles' Exclusive Records, owned by Leon Rene, who formed it to produce and market his own songs. Rene, a New Orleans Creole band leader/musician/songwriter, had migrated with the first wave to Los Angeles in 1921.
With only local distribution, the song might not have become a hit, but an alternative distribution system existed. Liggins remembered: ""Pullman porters would come into L.A. and buy this record from any record shop...at $1.05. They'd get off the train (in Chicago or points east), there'd be a line of people waiting to get it at $5 a copy.""19 Here is:
The Honeydripper . 53
In 1946, in an exception to the major companies' abandonment of black music, RCA Victor released a song written and recorded by Mississippian Arthur ""Big Boy"" Crudup. Born in Forest, Mississippi in 1905, he learned guitar at age 32 and was touring with a gospel group in Chicago in 1941 when the promoter stranded them. He was singing and sleeping on the streets when a record company discovered and recorded him, earning Crudup enough money to return to sharecropping in Mississippi. ""That's All Right"" did not place on music charts, but in 1949 it became the first blues or rhythm 'n' blues song released on the new 45rpm format, and five years later, it was recorded by Elvis Presley at his debut Sun Records session. Here is:
That's All Right .36
21
Also in 1946, a novelty rhythm and blues song went to # 2 on the R&B chart and # 2 on the pop chart. Novelty songs would become a staple of 1950s rock 'n roll, and this song's tag line soon became well known across the country. This song also demonstrated early tensions between middle class blacks who looked down on rhythm 'n' blues and the working class population that enjoyed it. The NAACP attacked this song for depicting unwholesome, stereotypical views of drunken black men. The artist is Los Angeles born Jack McVea and His All Stars. McVea, like many others of his generation, moved easily between rhythms 'n' blues and jazz, and appeared at the 1944 jazz concert we heard first, playing saxophone behind Illinois Jacquet. Here is:
Open The Door, Richard -1. 12
In January, 1948, Cincinnatti's King Records released a country blues song by a New Orleans born guitarist named Lonnie Johnson. This record - ""Tomorrow Night"" - was # 7 on the R&B chart for seven weeks, and rose to # 19 on the pop chart. Johnson played a style of guitar that influenced both the French Gypsy Django Reinhardt and Charlie Christian, who reinvented jazz guitar. Lonnie Johnson also influenced Elvis Presley, who recorded ""Tomorrow Night"" for Sun Records in 1954, mimicking Johnson's voice and interpretation. The record company, King, played an important roll in the development of black music too.
It was started in 1943 by Syd Nathan as a hillbilly label, catering to Cincinnatti's white migrants from the South, but soon added rhythm 'n' blues artists to its roster. Here is:
22
Tomorrow Night -.51
One of King's artists was Wynonie Harris, a Nebraskan signed in 1947. The musicians' strike was scheduled to begin on January 1, 1948; to build a back-log, in December, 1947 Harris recorded twenty songs, including a cover version of a song written and first recorded by Roy Brown in New Orleans.
New Orleans had a popular disc jockey, Poppa Stoppa, a white man, who was fed black slang by Dillard University professor Vernon Winslow, hired by the station.20 Poppa Stoppa made Brown's version a local hit - a natural vehicle for Harris who was called ""Mr. Blues."" Harris' version became a # 1 R&B hit, and spawned a series of ""rocking"" records. Here is:
Good Rockin' Tonight .51
Not every white disk jockey needed to be fed hep-talk by a black college professor, and not all had an easy time playing black music on white-owned radio stations. Zenas Sears, who had learned about black rhythm 'n' blues as an Army disc jockey, returned to his Atlanta station after the War.
""There were four stations and not one record with a black artist on any. Not even a Duke Ellington or Mills Brothers. And the station I came back to, where I had been before, was number four in popularity, and it would have been number eight if there were eight stations. So I started a program and played some black music at six o'clock in the morning to seven. The manager drank a good bit and never came to work before ten, with a serious hangover. He didn't know what was going on. We got a lot
23
of mail and sold some time to sponsors. So he liked it. We expanded it and did another hour between noon and one thirty. This was in January, 1946, I think.""
""In the end of 1947 the owner of the station, who lived in Columbus, Georgia, came to Atlanta and heard what we were doing. And that was the last day I worked there.""
""I got a job with WGST, a state-owned station, with the permission of Herman Talmadge to do a blues show at night. The manager wanted to do it 'cause they were running a bit short of money too. Radio at that time was beginning to feel TV breathing down their necks... So anything for a buck. And it was successful. It started about ten o'clock and stayed 'til one. And if I could sell more time to advertisers it went even longer. It had a good audience. That's when I became popular in the Negro community.""21 By then, he was known as ""Daddy"" Sears.
In August, 1948, a group whose success inspired countless other ornithological names, released ""It's Too Soon To Know."" Originally the Vibra-Naires, the Baltimore group named itself after Maryland's state bird - the Oriole. They had been preceded by the Ravens, and were quickly followed by the Crows, the Penguins, the Swallows, the Cardinals, the Wrens, the Robins, the Hawks, the Jayhawks and the Pelicans.
The song writer, a white Baltimore department store salesclerk named Deborah Chessler, had sung the song backstage at Baltimore's Royal Theater for Dinah Washington. Washington didn't record it, but the Orioles recorded a demo and Chessler used it
24
to get them on the popular New York radio show ""Arthur Godfrey's Talent Scouts."" They lost to blind British pianist George Shearing, but the several hundred telephone calls the show received indicated that many listeners thought the wrong winner had been chosen. Chessler took the Orioles to the New York label It's A Natural where they recorded ""It's Too Soon To Know."" Two New York late-night rhythm 'n' blues disc jockeys pushed the song. It sold 30,000 copies its first week in release. It became one of the first rhythm 'n' blues hits by a vocal group and went to # 14 on the pop charts. Here is:
It's Too Soon To Know 1. 34
One of the strains of Southern blues music is Delta blues, and in November, 1948, a blues song - the first electrified Delta blues hit - went to # 1 on the R&B chart. Like so many other songs of this period, it was recorded by an independent in Detroit, but unlike most rhythm 'n' blues records, this one did not feature the typical five - or seven-piece band - this was one man, John Lee Hooker, born a sharecropper near Clarksdale, Mississippi in 1920 or 1917. He worked in Memphis is the '30s and Chicago in the '40s. The success of this record inspired Sam Phillips in Memphis to open his record company a year later.
The producer explained how the record was made. ""We put a mike in his guitar, and we put a speaker - this was a tiny, two-room studio, remember - we put it in a toilet bowl next door... Then we put a mike under that so the sound would bounce off the water - I wanted that echo effect."" With a plank under his feet so
25
he could tap time and a microphone to pick up the tapping, ""Boogie Chillen"" was made.
It is a song about a young man coming of age in the city, breaking with his parents, and it mentions some of the favorite locales - Hastings Street, Henry's Club - where that young man might want to go. ""Boogie Chillen"" got a boost from Gene Nobles, an R&B disc jockey on WLAC, a clear channel station that reached from Nashville into 15 states and Canada and Greenland. One night, Nobles played it ten times in a row. Here is:
Boogie Chillen - 1.29
Country music played a role in rock 'n' roll's formation too. In 1945, a white guitar player from Clinton, South Carolina, who twice in the '40s was named Ebony magazine's guitarist of the year, released a record which became a # 8 hit on the country charts and a # 25 pop hit. Influenced by Django Reinhardt, Arthur Smith was stationed at a Naval base in Bainbridge, Maryland, near Washington, DC, during World War II. He commuted to Washington to work as a session musician for a record company begun by Irving Feld, owner of the Super Drug Store on Seventh Street in black Washington. Feld had begun a record company, Super Disc, to service his black customers, and Smith backed up gospel singer Sister Rosetta Tharpe and jazz pianist Errol Garner on Feld's records. Feld sold masters to the MGM Record Company, established in 1947, when the new company was looking for material in the middle of the musician's union 1948 strike. One song was ""Guitar Boogie"", and it influenced
26
guitarists Carl Perkins, Elvis Presley's guitarist Sonny Scottie Moore, and Glen Campbell. [An X is written in the right margin here.] Irving Feld abandoned his record company and became a promoter. It was during his Winter Party Dance Party tour in 1959 that Richie Valens, the Big Bopper and Buddy Holly were killed in an airplane crash. Here is:
Guitar Boogie .27
One of the most important rhythm 'n' blues record companies of the 1950s and 1960s was Atlantic, founded in 1947 by Ahmet Ertegun, the son of the former Turkish Ambassador to the United States, and a dentist, Herb Abramson. By 1949, the small sales of their jazz releases and the lack of new recordings caused by the musicians' strike had the company near bankruptcy when Ertegun received a call from his New Orleans distributor, seeking a label called Harlem Records. That company had a local hit in New Orleans, heavily plugged by white disc jockey Poppa Stoppa. The artiists were Stick McGhee and his Buddies. Ertegun asked Walter Brown ""Brownie"" McGhee, a well known blues guitarist, if he knew Stick McGhee. ""Sure,"" McGhee told him. ""He's my bother Granville."" The McGhees were from Kingsport, Tennessee.
Stick McGhee claimed the song originated in an Army camp in Petersburg, Virginia, where recruits sang ""Drinking' wine, mother-fucker, drinkin' wine."" But he remembered ""You couldn't say bed on a record, let alone mother-fucker.""22
Atlantic signed Stick McGhee, paying him a $300 advance, and accompanied by his brother, he re-recorded ""Drinkin' Wine Spo-Dee-O-Dee"" in early 1949. Like John Lee Hooker, McGhee mentions a
27
local spot - Willie's Den on New Orleans' Rampart Street. It was the 23rd Atlantic release. It saved the company, going to # 2 on the R&B chart and # 26 on the pop chart. It was one of the first party, drinking songs. Here is:
Drinkin' Wine Spo-Dee-O-Dee -1:14
The man most responsible for the smaller six-piece rhythm 'n' blues band was Louis Jordan. His success coincided with Billboard renaming ""race' music ""rhythm 'n' blues in 1949. Born in Brinkley, Arkansas in 1908, he formed his own band in 1938, renamed it the Tympany Five, adopted the costumes of the zoot-suiters, and began turning out a string of rhythm 'n' blues hits. Between 1938 and 1946, he sold five million 78s. Jordan's material, Nelson George writes, developed with his white producer Milton Gabler, ""didn't necessarily express Jordan's experience but was thought to mirror that of big-city blacks often not one generation removed from life in the rural South. The titles - 'Beans and Cornbread,' Saturday Night Fish Fry,' 'Ain't Nobody Here but Us Chickens,' - suggest country life, yet the subject of each is really a city scene.""23 ""Saturday Night Fish Fry"" celebrates good time black life, in the tradition of Bessie Smith's ""Gimmie A Pigfoot"". Here is:
Saturday Night Fish Fry - 1:27
New Orleans figures prominently in rock 'n roll history. ""Louisiana,"" Adam Fairclough writes, ""is the most diverse and unique Southern state"",24 and much of the music that has emerged from its largest city is unique. One of New Orleans' most
28
important rhythm 'n' blues pianists was Henry Roeland Byrd, better known as Professor Longhair. He was born in Bogalusa, Louisiana in 1918 but grew up in New Orleans. A New Orleans drummer, Charles Connor, said, ""He had the rhumba and the conga and all that stuff, and a little bit of blues""25 and influenced Huey Smith and Dr. John. Atlantic's Ahmet Ertegun heard Professor Longhair during a scouting visit to New Orleans in 1949. He had already recorded ""Mardi Gras In New Orleans"" for a Texas label, which folded, and re-recorded it for Atlantic. Here is:
Mardi Gras In New Orleans 1:06
The biggest rhythm 'n' blues artist of the 1950's came from the Crescent City too, but, like many others, recorded for a Los Angeles label, Imperial Records, formed in 1949 to record Mexican music. Imperial's owner wanted to get in on the ground floor of the new rhythm 'n' blues scene. In December, 1949 he heard Antoine ""Fats"" Domino Jr. singing in a New Orleans club. Domino was born in New Orleans in 1928. His first language was French.
This song, ""The Fat Man"", was a re-write of a prison song, ""Junker's Blues."" Domino deleted references to needles, cocaine and reefers. The song opens with Professor Longhair flavored boogie-woogie piano, and includes references to New Orleans streets - Rampart and Canal. Two years later, another New Orleans singer, Lloyd Price, had a seven week # 1 R&B hit with ""Lawdy Miss Clawdy."" Here is:
The Fat Man 1:18
In 1951, a song by a husband and wife team - a country and
29
western singer from Pasadena and a musical wizard from Waukeska, Wisconsin - stayed on the pop charts for nine weeks and reached # 2 on the R&B chart. It was one of the first hits to use massive overdubbing, although others had used it before, most successfully Patti Page. But Les Paul was a cross between Thomas Edison and Django Reinhardt. Using a tape recorder he had modified to allow him and his wife, Mary Ford, to accompany themselves, he was able to use the same tape over and over, building layer upon layer of voices and guitars. Gimmicks aside, what is remarkable here is his guitar solo, considered by some to be the first rock 'n' roll guitar solo. Here is:
How High The Moon 1:23
Whatever the merits of ""Rock Around The Clock"", music scholars think that a 1951 record by Ike Turner's band, featuring Turner's saxophonist singing, is the real first rock n' roll record.
""Rocket 88"", Peter Guralnick writes in his new biography of Elvis Presley, ""which has frequently been tagged as the first rock 'n' roll record, came out of Sam Phillips' studio in 1951 ...""26 The song is the creation of a band put together by Izear Luther ""Ike"" Turner, born just outside Clarksdale, Mississippi, in 1931, and his saxophonist, Jackie Brenston, born in Clarksdale in either 1927 or 1930. Clarksdale was a blues town - legend had Robert Johnson trading his soul to the devil just outside Clarksdale in the middle 1930s. Ike Turner was building his band, the Kings of Rhythm, and blues man B. B. King thought
30
they were good enough to record. He directed them to his studio, Memphis Recording Service. The studio's owner, Sam Phillips, had been leasing or selling master tapes of blues artists to Los Angeles' Modern Records, but when Modern lured B. B. King away, he decided to send the Ike Turner recordings to Chess Records in Chicago, who released it under the name of the singer with a made up name for the band - Jackie Brenston with his Delta Cats. The song - 'Rocket 88' - became a # 1 R&B hit. Here is:
Rocket 88 :48
Musical history is full of complaints that a particular music was licentious or that it fostered lewdness. Rhythm 'n' blues - and later rock 'n' roll - suffered these complaints, but a 1951 rhythm 'n' blues song, full of suggestive lyrics, spent thirty weeks on the R&B charts, including 14 weeks at # 1, and crossed over to a respectable # 17 on the pop charts. The song is about a character with his roots in 19th Century minstrel shows where he is Dan Tucker or Jim Dandy. Jim Dandy would reappear in 1956, when LaVern Baker put him on the pop charts. A 1921 song celebrated ""The Lady's Man, Dapper Dan from Dixieland"". A jazz group called the Black Dominoes recorded ""Dancing Dan Fox Trot"" in 1923; in 1930, Bessie Smith sang about her ""Kitchen Man"" - ""Wild about his turnip tops, like the way he warms my chops!"", and in 1931 she sang about ""Hustin' Dan."" In 1937 Georgia White sang about ""Dan the Backdoor Man.""
This 1951 hit was the brainstorm of Billy Ward, born in Los Angeles in 1921.
31
In 1951 in New York, he joined with a white talent agent, Rose Marks, who convinced him he should put together a singing group like the successful Ink Spots. Marks knew how fortunate another young white woman, Deborah Chessler, had been with black music. Ward put together a quartet he called the Dominoes, and Marks got them a spot on the ""Arthur Godfrey Talent Scouts"" show. They were heard by a black arranger-guitarist, Rene Hall, who alerted Cincinnatti's King Records to the group's potential.
The song went to number one, Hall said, ""despite the fact that it was banned from radio broadcast; they said it was too suggestive. Today it would be too tame.""27
""Sixty Minute Man"" has one other claim on rock 'n' roll history. Billy Ward agrees - with Freed himself - that Alan Freed named ""Sixty Minute Man"" a ""rock 'n' roll"" song, using the term to describe the music for the first time, even though the phrase in many variations had been part of the American vernacular and song titles and lyrics for ages. Ward said he and the disc jockey were sitting in Freed's studio in Cleveland in 1953 listening to Ward's hit when Freed exclaimed: ""'You know Billy, you've turned the music business upside down with this new music of yours. Its not authentic rhythm 'n' blues or jazz or pop. We've got to find a name for it...' At this juncture our record boomed, 'I rock 'em and roll 'em all night long. I'm a sixty minute man!' Freed leaped to his feet! 'That's it,' he cried hoarsely. 'Rock 'n' roll! That's what it is.'""28 Freed's biographer disputes this claim.
Freed had, at least, named his Cleveland radio show the
32
""Rock 'n' Roll Party"" sometime before 195429 Here is:
Sixty Minute Man - 1:32
In the years after the War, younger music fans continued looking for a dance beat and excitement in their music. The softer singers like Bing Crosby and Frank Sinatra were replaced by belters like Frankie Laine, whose 1947 hit, ""That's My Desire,"" was # 1 on Billboard's Harlem chart.
White youngsters who wanted to buy black records faced some difficulties. Atlanta disc jockey ""Daddy"" Sears remembered ""The breakthrough as far as the white teenager started about 1952. But it was gradual. And white teenagers didn't want to go to the record shop in their community and buy a black record. It was frowned on, you know, like buying marijuana today.""30
What white teenagers who had been attracted to black music lacked was a white teenage idol - a figure close to their ages, someone who seemed to understand their longings and heartbreaks - someone white who sang black. They found someone in Johnnie Ray. His first hit, ""Cry"", spent 11 weeks in 1951 as # 1 on the pop charts; it was also # 1 on the R&B charts. Ray was from Dallas, Oregon, and said his family ""listened to everything from Billie Holiday and Kate Smith to (country boogie singer) Rose Maddox."" But Holiday especially impressed him; ""It was like being possessed!"" he said.31 Ray was working in Detroit's Flame Bar in 1951 - the only white act at a black club - when he was spotted by a disc jockey who alerted Columbia Records to the phenomenon of a white man who sang with ""black gospel
33
intensity.""32 ""Cry's"" crossover was impressive, but Ray's performance style even more so. He was what Sam Philips said he wanted when he said, ""I got to thinking how many records you could sell if you could find white performers who could play and sing in this same exciting way.""33 Here is:
Cry - 1:49
In 1951, Bill Haley had a regional hit with a cover of Jackie Brenston's ""Rocket 88"". Covering a song already released by someone was an old, old story in the music business. Haley recorded ""Rocket 88"" with his hillbilly band, featuring a barrel house boogie beat and the record became a regional hit in Eastern Pennsylvania and New Jersey. Haley tells what happened next. ""I did a live country show on WPWA, and just before my show there was a show called 'Judge Rhythm's Court,' which was a two hour disc-jockey show by a guy named Jim Reeves. Jim was white, but he played all race music... He used a tune called 'Rock The Joint' [by Jimmy Preston] as a theme, and I started to use it in the show, and every time I would do it I would see this tremendous reaction. So I rewrote some of the lyrics, released the record, and it became a big smash hit for us.""
There are differences in the two versions. In the 1949 record, Haley's black homeboy, Jimmy Preston, sang about the jitterbug, the hucklebuck and the jelly roll; Haley sings about dances that fit his white country audience - the sugarfoot rag, the old Paul Jones, the Virginia reel.
Preston didn't use a guitar; Haley had three, his own
34
acoustic, an electric played by Danny Cedrone, and a steel guitar. Cedrone's solo is clearly inspired by Les Paul's solo from ""How High The Moon.""
Finally, Preston's original had used hand-clapping to establish the rhythm; Haley's bass player, Al Rex, used a style called ""slap bass."" Although the style had been in use for years in New Orleans bands, Rex told Haley's biographer ""I was the instigator of rock 'n' roll.""
The record was such a success for Haley he was hired to play in a black club in Chicago, following Dizzy Gillespie. Audiences walked out on him, and the engagement was cut short, but life for Bill Haley and his Saddlemen would never be the same.
Shortly after Haley's success, in September, 1952, a television show called ""Bandstand"" was broadcast for the first time by Philadelphia's WFIL TV. The host was Bob Horn, and his successor, Dick Clark, remembered that Horn ""knew about the waves that dee-jays like Alan Freed were making by playing rhythm 'n' blues for young white audiences, so Horn quickly began programming more rhythm music."" In fact, Freed's Cleveland audiences were almost exclusively black. Only ""as time went on"" did ""more and more whites listen."" and only after he had moved to New York and sponsored a January, 1955 rock 'n' roll dance did Freed have the ""first inkling...that white people enjoyed rhythm 'n' blues.""34 But rhythm 'n' blues wasn't the only music heard on radios.
In January, 1953, the nation's number one country and
35
western singer, Hank Williams, died. Before the month was out, MGM released four songs he had recorded the year before. One of them, ""Kaw-Liga,"" became a posthumous # 1 country hit for 13 weeks and rated # 23 on the pop charts.
Williams was one of the first hillbilly singers to be regularly covered by pop artists and a major influence on others, including performers as different as Chuck Berry, Dion, and Bob Dylan. Born in Mount Olive, Alabama, in 1923, he learned to play guitar from a black street musician named Rufe Payne, also known as Tee-Tot. Williams said: ""All the musical training I ever had was from him... I don't know one note from another.""35 ""Kaw-Liga"" ""had two separate tempos. The verses are sung over an Indian tom-tom beat, as a fiddle whines a lonely 'redskin' tune familiar to anyone raised on old cowboy movies. Then, on refrains, Hank and the band gallop into what Carl Perkins would later say was something ""hittin' close to rockabilly music.""36 Here is:
Kaw-Liga 1:06
One month after Williams scored a hit from the grave, a seminal song was released and stayed seven weeks at # 1 on the R&B charts. It launched the careers of two teenaged Jewish songwriters, Jerry Lieber and Mike Stoller, and later Elvis Presley, whose 1956 recording became one of the biggest rock 'n' roll hits. The song was ""Hound Dog"", and the singer was Willie Mae Thornton, born in Montgomery, Alabama, in 1926. It was released on Houston's Peacock Records, a label opened in 1949 by Don Robey, a black Jewish man of Irish descent, a pioneer in
36
black music recording and promotion. He owned a taxi company, a night club and a booking agency. Nelson George notes: ""A decade before Berry Gordy's ascendence, Robey was a successful black record executive.""37 Robey, unsatisfied with Thornton's sales, sent her to Los Angeles to be produced by Johnny Otis, a drummer of Greek descent ""who had married a black women and lived in the black milieu.""38 Otis claims he re-wrote a portion of the song written by Lieber and Stoller, although a subsequent lawsuit to claim a co-writer's credit was unsuccessful. ""They put some stuff in there which black people would find offensive"", he said. ""They had lyrics about knives and fighting and scars, all negative stereotypes.""
Whatever the truth of the story, the song was written for a woman, singing about a man who has outlived his sexual usefulness. A cover was recorded by another R&B group, Freddy Bell and the Bell Boys, and Presley heard them perform it live during his first, unsuccessful Las Vegas appearance in 1956. ""We stole it straight from them,"" Presley's guitarist Scotty Moore said. ""He already knew the song, but when we seen those guys do it, he said 'That's a natural'.""39 In the studio, Presley said, ""Let's do it the way them boys did it.""40 Here is Big Mama Thornton's:
Hound Dog - 1:20
Big Joe Turner was born in Kansas City in 1911. He claimed he originated the singing style of blues shouting, and a 1953 Turner hit linked Kansas City jazz with New Orleans rhythm 'n'
37
blues. The song also influenced a later 1954 Turner hit, ""Shake, Rattle and Roll"", which was covered by Bill Haley in a 1954 # 7 pop hit. This song, 'Honey Hush' was # 1 for eight weeks on the R&B charts and # 23 on the pop charts. Here is:
Honey Hush - :49
By 1953, rhythm 'n' blues music was increasingly listened to by white teenagers, and a small army of disc jockeys now played rhythm 'n' blues music - Hunter Hancock in Los Angeles, Zenas ""Daddy"" Sears in Atlanta, Ken ""Jack the Cat"" Elliot in New Orleans, and Tom 'Big Daddy"" Donahue in Washington - to service what Sponsor magazine called the ""forgotten 15 million black consumers in America"", and by the early '50s, most large Southern cities had black oriented radio stations. But only one R&B song - 1951's ""Sixty Minute Man"" - had broken into the pop top 20. ""Sixty Minute Man"" was an anomaly - a song so sexual it could not be sung on the popular television show, ""Your Hit Parade."" But a 1953 song ""Gee"" by a group with an avian appellation, the Crows, reached # 2 on the R&B charts and # 14 on the pop charts. It was also the first '50s style doo-wop song to sell a million records. The record's success was due to a white disc jockey who played black music, Los Angeles' Dick ""Huggy Boy"" Hugg. He broadcast a show, ""Harlem Hit Parade"" from the front window of a popular record store at the corner of Vernon and Central Avenues in the middle of black Los Angeles, the epi-center, incidentally, of the 1965 riot. ""Gee's"" success prompted Billboard to write in April, ""Teenagers Going for Music With a Beat As Industry Reaps A
38
Financial Harvest."" The article said, ""One of the fastest growing segments of the record business is the rhythm 'n' blues field.… More than 700 jocks across the country devote their air time exclusively to rhythm 'n' blues platters.…Teenagers are instigating the current trend toward r & b and are largely responsible for keeping its sales mounting.…""41 Here is:
Gee - :57
Big Joe Turner's 1953 hit ""Honey Hush"" was the predicate for his next big hit, ""Shake, Rattle and Roll."" He had been singing versions of this song during World War II, but writing credit went to Charles Calhoun, a pseudonym for Atlantic Records A&R man Jesse Stone. Stone thought white teenagers would listen to rhythm 'n' blues as long as it had a danceable rhythm. ""So I designed a bass-pattern,"" he said, ""and it sort of became identified with rock 'n' roll.""42
The song also has its share of double entendre - ""over the hill, way down underneath"" and ""wearing low dresses, the sun comes shinin' through, girl I can't believe all that mess belongs to you."" ""Shake, Rattle and Roll"" went to # 1 on the R&B charts and # 22 on the pop charts. Bill Haley's cover version went to # 7 on the pop charts, but both sold over one million records, making it the first giant rock 'n' roll hit. Haley's version cleaned up the song; ""wearing low dresses"" became ""Wearing those dresses, you hair done up so nice"". Where Turner sang ""I believe to my soul you're the devil in nylon hose"" Haley sang "" I believe you're doin' me wrong and now I know."" Elvis Presley's
39
1956 version mixed Haley's and Turner's lyrics, and as if to play homage to his inspiration, when Presley performed the song at his first television appearance on the Dorsey Brothers Stage Show in January, 1956, he segued from it into ""Flip, Flop and Fly,"" Turner's follow-up record. Here is Joe Turner's:
Shake, Rattle and Roll - 1:19
Proof of rhythm and blues' popularity outside black record buyers was demonstrated by a February, 1954 crossover rhythm 'n' blues hit - # 1 on the R&B charts, # 22 on the pop charts.
Like ""Sixty Minute Man"" it was dripping with sexual innuendo. ""...we had this slang word in the ghetto,"" the artist and writer Hank Ballard said. ""You'd say 'Can I get some work tonight baby?'... Yeah, it meant sex.""43 The song was ""Work With Me, Annie"" and it became a run-away best seller, despite opposition from the Federal Communications Commission and some black groups.
It spawned a series of answer songs: ""Annie Had A Baby"", ""Annie's Aunt Fanny"", ""Annie's Answer"", ""Annie Pulled a Hum-Bug"", ""Mamma Took The Baby"", ""I'm the Father of Annie's Baby"", ""My Name Ain't Annie"" and ""Annie Kicked The Bucket"". In 1956, a Hank Ballard fan named Buddy Holly recorded ""Annie Been A-Working On The Midnight Shift."" Here is Hank Ballard and the Midnighters':
Work With Me, Annie - 1:35
Covering songs - like Bill Haley's cover of ""Shake, Rattle and Roll"" - was, as I mentioned, an old story in the music business, and not restricted to white artists covering black
40
ones. In 1954, Atlantic Records recorded a new black group - the Chords - expressly to cover a Patti Page hit ""Cross Over The Bridge."" They also recorded a nonsense song that became one of the first doo-wop hits, the first independent label rhythm 'n' blues single to reach the top 10 on the pop charts, placing # 2 on the R&B charts and # 5 on the pop charts, and forcing the industry to look closer at the growing R&B market.44 A cover by a white group - the Crew Cuts - became a # 1 pop hit. Here is:
Sh-Boom 1:12
By 1954, Billy Haley had changed his group's name to the Comets as his music became less country and more influenced by rhythm 'n' blues, and he had appeared on the popular local tv show, ""Bandstand."" He had successfully covered two R&B hits - ""Rocket 88"" and ""Rock the Joint"" - and had a pop hit with ""Crazy Man, Crazy.""
His successes won him a contract with a major company, Decca, and a producer, Milt Gabler, who had produced Louis Jordan and Billy Holiday. ""I was aware that rock was starting,"" Gabler said. ""I knew what was happening in the Philadelphia area, and 'Crazy Man, Crazy' had been a hit about a year before that. It was already starting and I wanted to take it from there.""
In May, 1954, the Gabler produced song - ""Rock Around The Clock"" - entered the pop top 40 and peaked at # 23, a modest success. But it had a second life.
Post-war prosperity and highway construction had contributed to the spread of the suburbs. One result was an increase in
41
drive-ins - from less than 1% of all theaters pre-war to 20% of all theaters by 1953. The drive-in, in turn, was a tribute to America's growing car culture, reflected in popular songs like 1950's ""Hot Rod Race"" and 1951's ""Rocket 88"", and to the growing market strength of teenagers. ""Teenagers were believed to be the controlling sector of the drive-in audience, so teenage movies were sure to follow.""45 In 1955, ""Rock Around The Clock"" opened one of the first, Blackboard Jungle, a movie which played on news stories about delinquency and the evil influence of rhythm 'n' blues music on American youth. Some movie audiences danced in the aisles; others cut up theater seats with switchblade knives. The movie and the song were news. The song was # 1 on the pop charts for eight weeks and # 3 on the R&B charts. Here is Bill Haley's:
Rock Around The Clock - 42
In the fall of 1953, Elvis Presley recorded two demos at Sam Phillips' Memphis Recording Service. A year later Phillips called Presley back to the studio. One of the songs he recorded was Arthur Crudup's ""That's All Right.""
Two years later, Presley told an interviewer, ""I used to hear Arthur Crudup bang his box the way I do now, and I said that if I ever got to the place where I could feel all that Arther felt, I'd be a music man like nobody ever saw.""46 Peter Guralnick describes a friend visiting Presley's Memphis home in 1955: "".…he found him with a stack of records - Ray Charles and Big Joe Turner and Big Mama Thornton and Arthur 'Big Boy' Crudup - that he studied with the avidity that other kids focused on
42
their college exams. He listened over and over, seeming to hear something that no one else could hear...""47
The Presley version changes some lyrics, but Presley pitched his voice high, like Crudup, and slapped his guitar strings for syncopation, just as Crudup had done. On the session tape, you can hear Sam Phillips say: ""That's different. That's a pop song now.""48
It was the first Elvis Presley record, and while it did not score beyond regional country and western charts, it brought Presley to the attention of RCA, winning him a spot on the Grand Ole Opry and regular appearances on the Louisiana Hayride. Here is Elvis Presley's:
That's All Right :49
As long as markets remained segregated, no one was hurt by covers, and it benefited publishers eager to have as many versions of a song they owned sold as possible. The practice grew in the early '50s, however, as it became clear that white teenagers were attracted to rhythm 'n' blues. As R&B began to cross-over, record companies began issuing subdued, quieter versions of R&B hits.
From 1954 to 1957, most of Pat Boone's hits were covers - Fats Domino's ""Ain't That a Shame"", the El Dorados' ""At My Front Door"", Little Richard's ""Tutti Frutti"" and ""Long Tall Sally"", Ivory Joe Hunter's ""Since I Lost My Baby"" and others. By 1957, Pat Boone' piracy had become so pronounced that some disc jockeys - like Alan Freed - refused to play Boone's pale imitations.
43
White teenagers were already beginning to buy the black originals.
A convincing demonstration of rhythm 'n' blues' ability to compete with white impersonations came in October, 1954, with a song called ""Earth Angel"". Black Los Angeles record company owner Walter ""Dootie"" Williams recorded the Penguin's ""Earth Angel"" and white disc jockey ""Huggy Boy"" Hugg gave it a push.
The record got an additional boost from the new strength independent distributors had built up over years of fighting to win store and juke box space and radio air play for independent releases. When Mercury Records, a cover mill, recorded and distributed an ""Earth Angel"" cover by the Crew Cuts, the original went head to head with the copy. The white version went to # 3 on the pop charts; the prototype was # 1 on the R&B charts and # 8 on the pop charts. Here is:
Earth Angel 1:00
Cover piracy reached its zenith with LaVern Baker's ""Tweedle Dee."" Chicago-born Baker had a distinguished musical pedigree. Her aunt was Minnie McCoy, who recorded as Memphis Minnie, a blues singer in the '20s and '30s. Baker began by appearing as Little Miss Sharecropper, and by 1954 had a respectable career as an R&B artist. Her record company, Atlantic Records, anticipated white covers by trying to split the difference - recording their rhythm 'n' blues artists with pop arrangements, denying their pop competitors one marketing advantage. Baker's version of ""Tweedle Dee' wasn't just covered by Georgia Gibbs on Mercury - Gibbs'
44
version copied the song, the singing style, and the arrangement.
Baker appealed without success to her Congressman, Charles Diggs (D.-Mich) to revise the copyright law. Gibbs' copy became a # 2 pop hit; Baker's original only reached # 14 on the pop charts and # 4 on the R&B charts.
Here is Lavern Baker's:
Tweedle Dee :51
Popular music is full of stories of artists as successful - sometimes more so - in death as in life - Buddy Holly, Elvis Presley, Hank Williams, and Johnny Ace.
Ace died 23 days after his most popular song - ""Pledging My Love"" - was released. Ace was John M. Alexander, born a minister's son in Memphis in 1929. He recorded unsuccessfully with Ike Turner in 1951 and had an R&B hit with Don Robey's Peacock label in 1952. On Christmas Eve, 1954, at the age of 24, he was sitting backstage at Houston's Civic Auditorium, a young woman on his lap, talking to Big Mama Thornton, when he pulled out a 22 pistol, put the barrel to his temple and pulled the trigger. His sensational death and the public grief which followed created a huge demand for the song. Billboard reported it was ""almost as popular with pop customers as with R&B."" It went to # 17 on the pop charts and was # 1 on the R&B charts for ten weeks.
""Pledging My Love"" made other marks; it outsold its pop cover versions by Teresa Brewer, the Four Lads and Louis Armstrong and it was one of the first to sell more 45s than 78s,
45
demonstrating a demographic shift in the record buying public. White and black teenagers were 45 buyers; adults purchased 78s. Here is Johnny Ace's:
Pledging My Love 1:22
In the middle 1950s, rhythm 'n' blues began to break into larger markets. It also began to change, adopting new forms that would break through in the 1960s.
One of the architects of R&B's success and its change was Ray Charles, born Ray Charles Robinson in Albany, Georgia, in 1930. Black church music, swing bands, blues and country music were his influences. He listened to the Grand Old Opry as a child and told a writer, ""I would never miss that for nothing.""49
Charles, who migrated to Seattle in 1947, had a series of records imitating Nat Cole's piano style and Charles Brown's piano and singing, but with ""I Got A Woman"" he found his own voice. It is based on Professor Alex Bradford's ""My Jesus Is All The World To Me"", and is one of several Ray Charles songs re-written from spirituals. A year later, at his first RCA session, Elvis Presley recorded it for his first album. Presley's album sold several million copies, was # 1 for ten weeks, and introduced a mass audience to rock 'n' roll.
Here is Ray Charles':
I Got A Woman - 1:18
Charles Edward Anderson Berry was 29 years old when he became America's first teenage guitar hero. In 1955, his ""Maybellene"" was # 1 on the R&B charts for eleven weeks and # 5
46
on the pop charts. It blended country music with good-time rhythm 'n' blues, and like other Berry songs, it had lyrics that appealed to teenagers. Unlike some R&B artists, he was easily understood by white listeners. In his autobiography Chuck Berry, he said: ""...I stressed my diction so that it was harder and whiter."" Berry's success with his first record is a good example of the payola scandal - pay for play - that rocked the business in the late '50s. New York disc jockey Alan Freed received a writer's credit and royalties in return for pushing the record, as did the Chicago distributor Russ Fratto. Neither man had anything to do with writing or performing the song.
""Maybellene"" is more than a car song; it is a hot-rod song that speaks directly to the youthful car culture. Here is Chuck Berry's:
Maybellene 1:03
Richard Wayne Penniman was born in Macon, Georgia, in 1932. Richard was heir to and influenced by two pioneering gay performers - Atlanta's Billy Wright and South Carolina-born singer-pianist Eskew Reeder who performed as Esquerita. Wright was an R&B singer with four top 10 R&B hits between 1949 and 1951, but was equally well known as a drag show performer and flamboyant master of ceremonies who dressed extravagantly and wore his hair in a four-inch high pompadour.
Little Richard won an Atlanta radio talent contest, and received a contract with RCA and later signed with Houston's Peacock Records with little success. A tape he sent to Art Rupe's
47
Specialty Records in Los Angeles produced a New Orleans recording session, and ""Tutti Frutti"" was one of that session's songs.
The original lyrics were more than risque. ""Tutti frutti, good booty, if it don't fit, don't force it, you can grease it, make it easy.""
It made Little Richard a rock star, the music's first wild man. It went to # 2 on the R&B chart and # 17 on the pop chart. Here is Little Richard's:
Tutti Frutti 1:19
Carl Lee Perkins was born in 1932 to a sharecropper family near the Mississippi River in Ridgely, Tennessee. As a youngster, he listened to the Grand Ole Opry, but the greatest impression was made on him by a black bluesman, Uncle John Westbrook, who lived a field away. ""I'd ask my daddy if I could go to Uncle John's and pick some.…It was his inspiration that made me know what it was I wanted to do for the rest of my life...I could never get away from what was buried in my mind of the sound he made on that simple little guitar.""50
Perkins described rockabilly music as ""A country man's song with a black man's rhythm""51 and the three Sun studio takes demonstrate owner Sam Phillips coaxing Perkins from hillbilly to rockabilly. Even the lyrics become less country. Take # 1's ""Go, boy go"" became ""go, cat go"" by Take # 3; ""drink my corn"" becomes ""drink my liquor"" by Take # 3.
The song, ""Blue Suede Shoes"", did for Sun Records what Elvis Presley could not do - produce a hit. It attracted others to Sun,
48
including Jerry Lee Lewis and Roy Orbison. It was on Billboard's country chart for half a year and at # 1 for three weeks. It was # 2 on the R&B chart for four weeks. And it was # 2 on the pop chart for four weeks, the first record to chart at the top of all three charts.
Presley recorded it in January, 1956, but made RCA hold it back to keep from hurting Perkins or Philips.
Here is Carl Perkins':
Blue Suede Shoes :43 :39
Elvis Presley left Sun Records for RCA a month before Perkins recorded 'Blue Suede Shoes.' His new company wasn't sure what to do with him and began by re-issuing his Sun sides. His first RCA session was in a converted church in Nashville, and one of the songs was ""Heartbreak Hotel."" The song was released on January 28; by the end of March ""it had sold close to a million copies and, in an unprecedented achievement, (mirrored only by Carl Perkins' ""Blue Suede Shoes"" at virtually the same time), was closing in on the top of all three charts: pop, country, rhythm 'n' blues.""52 It was # 1 on the country charts for seventeen weeks; # 3 on the R&B charts and # 1 on the country charts for eight weeks. It was 1956's biggest single. Elvis Presley became the biggest entertainer of the 20th Century. Rock 'n' Roll music was here to stay. Here is:
Heartbreak Hotel :39
By the time of Presley's 1956 triumph, the elements of rock 'n' roll were all in place. New performers who appealed to the
49
young audience had appeared singing and playing songs that young people could dance to with lyrics that spoke to them.
The disc jockeys and their young audiences were firmly in charge. New York's franchise on the pop stream, typified by Tin Pan Alley's Brill Building, did not place one song on the Top Ten Pop Chart in 1955. Three R&B songs - including Chuck Berry's ""Maybellene"" - crossed over to the C&W and Pop charts, and Berry's version of his song was a Pop and R&B hit.
In 1956, the Encyclopedia Brittanica's Book of the Year gave the new music's name official sanction - they included an entry on rock 'n' roll and called it popular music ""at its lowest ebb in the so-called 'rock 'n roll"" style' of rhymetric chant (which) concentrated on a minimum of melody line and a maximum of rhythmic noise, deliberately competing with the artistic ideals of the jungle itself.""
For many, that was what the music was them; for many, that is what it is now, but the study of this music and its history has much to tell us.
As I said at the beginning, it is American history, and like all American history, it is suffused with race. Like all American history, it has its share of tragedy and triumph, heroes and villians. But it is ultimately the history of survival, of cultures clashing and mingling; as Vincent Harding put it, the history of ""the creation of a more just and democratic society.""53
Here is the theme song of the 20th Century effort to create
50
that society:

An article describes how the integrated rock group Hootie and the Blowfish was denied South Carolina's coveted Palmetto Award because their black lead singer, Darius Rucker, objected to the Confederate flag flying over the state capitol.
Reverence for the past, and disagreement over what that past is, is central to the two papers presented here.
These two papers focus on flags - in Coski, the Confederate Battle Flag flies high; Moss raises both it and the American flag.
Both write about these flags as symbolic and real standards, expressions of ideology confiscated in the context of arguments over race.
Coski states early on that he will not address the schizophrenic disconnect between many flag defender's insistence that the Confederate banner did not celebrate a defense of slavery and a ""rebellion"" against the United States and that the Civil War ""had no inherent link to racial issues"" and the reality of a war fought to preserve slavery.
Instead, he traces ""the emergence of the flag as a visible symbol in American life"" to its ""reuniting"" in 1948 and the Dixiecrat movement with its ideological roots.
He notes that while flag preservationists sometimes objected
2
to flag use for racist ends, their objections frequently carried a class bias, inveighing against flag use by those described as ""trashier white elements,"" ""leather-jacketed teenagers"" and ""slack-jawed youths,"" rather than by the more respectable, middle class opponents of segregations. I should would have liked more discussion of the class divide in the use of the flag by the Southern whites.
Moss, on the other hand, brings black Southerners into the flag debate. Rather than ceding control of the Confederate Battle Flag to whites, Moss writes, blacks used it too, and she comments on a variety of uses and a variety of flags. She writes about the appropriation of flags, patriotism, and national holidays by opposing sides in the integration wars. 
And she makes an excellent point about the declining ""unitary significance"" of the American flag by the middle 1960s. , and the places the 
One remembers anti-war rallies of the period where those who marched under the NLF flag resented those who chose to carry the Stars and Stripes. 
Both papers remind us that flags send signals of America's racial divide. Much like the recent O.J. Simpson verdict, the racially polarized voting in this week's contests in Virginia, Mississippi and elsewhere, in the flags they honor, fly, salute or burn, black and white Americans understand and recognize flags' messages differently. Like Colin Powell, flags appear to be blank slates ready to receive the messages we write upon them. But these slates are far from blank. They come to us
3
heavily freighted with a history of use as emblems in the race war. Those who use them know these flags carry great weight.
Just as many white Americans invested an enormous amount of emotional energy in Simpson's guilt, many white Southerners have had, and have today, an enormous historical-emotional investment in appropriating the Confederate battle flag as a symbol of white supremacy. 
Many blacks did, and still do, share this view, and as Moss writes, many blacks saw the American flag as the Confederate flag's opposite. 
There is ample evidence in the recent past of the Confederate flag's associations, readily understood by those who use it. 
In March of this year, 19-year-old Kenneth Westerman was memorialized in Guthrie, Kentucky. He had been killed in January in Springfield, Tennessee. Seven black youths have been charged with his murder in what police say was a reaction to the Confederate flag he displayed on his truck. 
At the Westerman service, where a Confederate flag draped his grave, the Heritage Chairman of Kentucky Sons of Confederate Veterans memorialized the dead man as ""a fallen Confederate patriot. He joined the Confederate dead under the same honorable circumstances."" 
Another mourner, dressed in what newspapers described as an antebellum hoop skirt, said, ""He gave his all. He gave his life.""
4
And one speaker from the racist, anti-semetic Southern League, Inc. decried ""brown-shirted street thugs"" and warned of ""mongrelized multi-culturalism."" 
The League, of course, celebrates an exclusively white and Christian South, flying under Confederate banners, putting a happy face on the politics of racist rage. ,and [like] in a reminder of Coski's class divide, represents a class step upward, if on several s
Also in March, the Chairman of the Virginia Republican Party defended his attendance at a Confederate Flag Ceremony. ""If I worried about the message, the impressions, I woudn't do anything,"" he said. ""It's the right thing to do."" 
I would have wanted Coski to provide deeper examination of the escalated embrace of the Confederate flag by integration opponents after Brown v Board of Education in 1954 and during the period of massive resistance which followed. 
Perhaps time and length constraints did not allow for a closer examination of the relationship between Coski's Confederate flag and the occasions where it is displayed and the reactions of those who saw it. 
Central to both papers is the questions of whether symbols of the past can be separated from the past they represent. 
I would argue that they cannot, and invite this audience's attention to Driving Dixie Down: Removing the Confederate Flag from Southern State Capitols in the Yale Law Journal by James Forman, Jr. 
Forman, the son and namesake of the noted civil rights activist, argues that removing the Confederate flag from state
5
capitols, at least, is constitutionally required. 
Forman closes his article with a reminiscence of his high school days in Atlanta when his homeroom seat allowed him a view of the school caretaker raising the Georgia State Flag. 
""I am drawn to this flag, particularly its wholesale incorporation of Dixie. I observe the same scene almost every morning, and almost every morning I hate the fact that I watch. I want to desperately to ignore the flag, ignore Dixie, and ignore the history for which it stands."" 
""For relief, I take my eyes off the flag and glance down again at the groundskeeper, who is still pulling the cords to raise the trio of flags. Like most of the students and teachers, the groundskeeper is black. I think of the incongruity of having black children, in a largely black city, watch a black man raise the symbol of the Confederacy for us all to honor. I tell myself to laugh, hoping that this will keep me from crying. But I cannot laugh, and I dare not cry, so I close my eyes and try to forget. If I could just forget. My eyes close tightly, my fists clench, and I slowly force from my eyes images of the flag, of the Ku Klux Klan, of Bull Conner and George Wallace - of black people in chains, hanging from trees, kept illiterate, denied the opportunity to vote."" 
""The bell has rung. My teacher is calling my name: ""James, are you ok?"" I look up startled. ""Yes ma'am, I'm fine,"" I say, as I collect my books and head for class. ""I'm fine,"" I repeat to myself as I walk out the door. I have forgotten; I have purged my mind; I am able to get up and walk out of the door. But overcoming the flag has taken a piece of me - a piece that I will not easily recover."" 1"

Heroes, Hope and History
I am the grandson of a slave. That fact, which I share in common with many, many others, makes me heir to and product of American history, a history which is as contentious today as when it was first being made.
My grandfather's life began in 1863. Because he was born in Kentucky, freedom did not come to him until the 14th Amendment became law in 1865. His personal history, like mine, is not unique.
His slave mother had been given away as a wedding present to a new bride, and when that bride became pregnant, her husband — my great-grandmother's owner, exercised his right to take his bride's slave as his mistress. That union produced two children, one of them my grandfather.
Now that slave's grandson teaches at the university founded by slave owner Thomas Jefferson in Virginia, teaching young Americans about the modern day struggle for human liberty. That struggle has its roots in Jefferson's words more than his deeds, and its parallels in my grandfather's membership in a transcendent generation — that body of black women and men born in the 19th Century in servitude, freed from slavery by the civil war, determined to make their way as free women and men.
My students are modern young women and men, filled with the
2
cynicism and despair of their age. For them, these are the worst of times, and my daily documentation of a harsher and more oppressive past does not always convince them that these days are better than the days they study with me.
I teach them about a more recent transcendent generation than my grandfather's. They learn about a generation born in segregation in the 20th Century, freed from racism's restraints through their own efforts, determined to make their way as free women and men.
One of my tasks is to demonstrate the democratic and optimistic nature of the movement. By aiming a microscope at the mass, I help my students discover unknown heroes and heroines. I hope to demonstrate the confidence and sense of possibility which was the movement's engine. By giving voice to the hopefulness of earlier generations who faced resistance and oppression my students have never known, and will never know, I hope to make heroism more available, more attainable to a generation inclined to see through a glass darkly.
I want my students to learn history, heroes, and hope.
Preserving and interpreting the civil rights past requires acknowledgement that the movement was made, not by a few, but by many.
It requires that they have available, in texts and videos, in libraries and museums, the materials and artifacts and interpretations which will allow them freedom to make informed judgments about the past, the present, and our common future.
""History,"" as the Historical Society notes, ""is a process
3
critical for our future.""
""Citizens ... have rights to impartial justice impartially administered, equality of opportunity, freedom from threats of physical violence, and secure enjoyment of the results of their labor.""
These values are precisely what the Southern civil rights movement sought.
For those of us who teach modern American history, these last several years have been filled with anniversaries which make welcome books upon which history can be hung to guide our reinterpretation of the past.
This year, 1996, is the 100th anniversary of Plessy v. Ferguson, the 1896 Supreme Court decision which wrote the pernicious doctrine of ""separate but equal"" into law.
Last year, 1995, was the 30th anniversary of the Selma to Montgomery march which capped a long campaign for federal protection of black voting rights; in 1965, Alabama Governor George Wallace was the march's target; last year, he greeted their triumphal reenactment.
The summer of 1994 marked the three-decade anniversary of Freedom Summer, '64; over 200 of the summer's volunteers, now middle aged, gathered in Jackson for a reunion.
1993 was the 30th anniversary of the historic 1963 March on Washington, then the largest gathering ever to demand civil rights, the moment when Martin Luther King, Jr. told the nation of his dream.
4
These anniversaries of events in the recent past are of special benefit to movement historians. They provide a handy platform from which retrospectives can be launched, and a proper distance from which to look back upon an event with suitable detachment.
They handily regulate the separation of yesterday from the present while providing formal opportunity for rumination and self-examination, an opportunity to ask new questions or provide fresh answers to old ones.
Yet in our glorification of the past, we often bemoan the present day reality. From the present we look backward and see the modern civil rights movement as heroic, with King in the leading role. I want to discuss King as hero, first in the larger context, and specifically in his role in Birmingham 30 years ago.
By regarding King and the civil rights movement as heroic, we miss the reality of each. Each becomes more — and less — than they actually were, robbing today's lesser mortals of any ability to duplicate history's heroism today.
So let me first examine the notion of heroes — who they were yesterday and are today, why we require them, and how we explain them to generations who did not know them as we did.
Carlyle wrote: ""Hero worship exists, has existed, and will forever exist, universally among mankind.""1
Closer to our own times, that wise sage Ronald Reagan told us, ""Heroes may not be braver than anyone else; they're just braver five minutes longer.""2
5
When the United States was being born, our heroes were its creators. As the new nation pushed further westward, our heroes were frontiersmen. When the nation was torn over slavery, our hero was the martyred president. When the re-united nation went to war, our heroes were soldiers and their generals.
These figures came to us through a popular press as eager then as now to manufacture and exaggerate. But the invention of the motion picture and its spreading popularity, the creation of a single America of instantaneous, shared experience through radio, and then television, and the creation of celluloid creatures has, I think, changed our expectations of who our heroes might be.
Perhaps the biggest change has been in how we expect our heroes to look and sound. Radio, movies and television celebrated bass-baritone voices. The high pitched voices of Eugene V. Debs and Theodore Roosevelt cause nervous laughter when they are heard today. The application of a looks and sounds test where a deeds test alone had sufficed altered who our heroes could be; heroism was expected of those who looked and sounded the part.
Our heroes, then, have changed as technology has changed our expectations, and that technology expanded the lists from which heroes could be chosen — today they come more often from weekly combat on the playing field than from the battleground.
The oral tradition that once transmitted heroic words from generation to generation has been replaced by the VCR; today we can fast-forward through a modern hero's life to get to the good parts.
Once we were inspired by the telling; today we are entertained
6
by the viewing.
Buckskin clad backwoodsmen and powder wigged Founding Fathers have been replaced by the Italian suited Wall Streeter and the head-shaved sports star. That athlete transcends racial boundaries; today, almost 30 years after his death, so does Martin Luther King.
This marvelous man who was my college teacher speaks in death and memory to whites and blacks as he never did in life.
In grainy film taken at his 1963 March on Washington speech, we hear again the measured, rhythmic cadence, we see the commanding presence, we hear the booming voice, we share the martyr's dream.
We honor him because of what he means in our imperfect and selective memories — the stoic who faced injury and death, the major figure of his period, the spokesman for nonviolence, able to articulate for whites what blacks wanted and for blacks what would be required if freedom was to be the prize.
But that King is half the man. The King we see is a blurred picture of who the man was. We now know that King was larger than the movement and the movement larger than Martin Luther King.
The reappraisals of King, his leadership, the movement he helped to make, and even his character have taken a familiar path.
In the spring of 1963, he emerged triumphant from Birmingham. He had skillfully employed youthful demonstrators whose buoyancy and vitality provoked the anticipated and nationally televised violence from the local police. He had drawn an unwilling President into his drama; the President's men helped make a settlement possible.
7
A few months later his dramatic speech at the March on Washington cemented his place as first among equals in America's civil rights leadership. Like the beatings and hosings in Birmingham, King's Washington speech was televised; in a nation-wide mass meeting, an American audience was treated for the first time to the unedited oratory of America's principal preacher, and for the first time, a mass white audience heard the undeniable justice of black demands. By 1965 King was at the apex of black leadership; his success in Selma at soliciting national revulsion at racist violence translated into federal action and marked him as the primary figure in America in the leadership of what was being called the Negro revolution. With King as leader, the organized movement would remain peaceful, and the movement's goals would remain inclusion into the American mainstream, but other events and personalities would begin to intrude.
In December, 1964, King was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize; within a few months he demonstrated he took the Prize seriously, speaking out against the War in Vietnam.
King's conscience could not avoid involving him against the war, and his anti-war activities gave him a chance to further define himself.
""I'm much more than a civil rights leader,"" he said in mid-1965, while insisting his major focus would continue to be the struggle against black oppression.
He took a campaign against discrimination and black poverty to Chicago in 1965 and 1966, but Chicago's rigid politics suffocated
8
the movement he tried to build. He still peppered his speeches with darts against the war and spoke more forcefully against what he called America's ""vicious class system(s).""
""If our economic system is to survive,"" he told his Atlanta congregation, ""there must be a better distribution of wealth... We can't have a system where some people live in superfluous, inordinate wealth while others live in abject, deadening poverty.""3
In the middle of King's Chicago campaign, James Meredith was shot on his one-man march through Mississippi; King and others took up the March. In a dusty cotton field Stokeley Carmichael shouted ""Black Power,"" and the rift between King's moderation and the militancy of other movement figures became public. Black power did more than frighten whites and black moderates; it divided support for the movement and gave sanction to those who thought American blacks already had won enough.
Acceptable pluralism became unacceptable separatism when the proponents' skins were black; pride became arrogance when nonviolent petitioner became militant demander.
King's last years were marked by attitudinal changes — in black America's demands and white Americans' response. In Montgomery in 1955 blacks had asked for seats at an abundant table; they could gain and no one — except the believers in white supremacy — had to lose. As the movement grew in strength and extended beyond the borders of the Old Confederacy, many whites began to believe blacks wanted the whole table for themselves.
King interrupted preparations for a Poor People's March on
9
Washington to help striking garbage workers in Memphis; it was there he was murdered in 1968.
The violence he fought against in life, had exploited so brilliantly to win sympathy for civil rights in the South, exploded across America in the aftermath of his death.
Eighteen years later, President Ronald Reagan reluctantly signed the law that made King's birthdate a national holiday, and today schoolchildren across America know part of the story of Martin Luther King. His heroic status was assured.
There is much that schoolchildren do not know. They do not know that in Martin Luther King's America what had been ""a culture with a racist ideology"",4 became ""a chronically racist culture""5 after Emancipation, unifying all who found themselves ""within the Caucasian chalk circle""6, offering reward and punishment based on pigmentation, in King's times and today.
The movement King helped to lead destroyed the moral authority undergirding that culture; that is why we honor him today. We do not honor the severe critic of capitalism and its excesses. We do not honor the pacifist who preached that all wars were evil, who said a nation which chose guns over butter would starve its people and kill itself. We do not honor the man who linked apartheid in South Africa and South Alabama. We honor an antiseptic hero.
He could not have imagined his birthday would be a national holiday or that American schoolchildren of all races would spend the days surrounding January 15 each year declaiming his March on Washington speech, learning about Rosa Parks and the boycott in
10
Montgomery.
And he could not have imagined that he would be considered by many to be a hero, for if he realized he was worshiped in his lifetime, he thought that worship vainglorious and misplaced. He knew his failings.
Because his opinions remain controversial today, we selectively honor only part of the whole man; even the most vigorous opponents of civil rights can find a King quote to camouflage their racism. They often chose excerpts from the ""I Have A Dream"" speech given 33 years ago.
INSERT — aa
The movement that gave us Martin Luther King is now on view in museums across America, from the grand Museum of American History in Washington to the humble Voting Rights Museum in Selma, Alabama.
Large and small, they have a singular role in our society. What they display, and how they display it, confirms what is important in our lives, past and present. They can give value and respect to the despised and downtrodden. They can make heroes and heroines of the forgotten.
Birmingham — and its Civil Rights Institute — is a perfect example.
1993 was also the 30th anniversary year of Martin Luther King's movement in Alabama's largest city. I first knew Birmingham as a student from Atlanta; it was a place where you did not linger after football games between Atlanta's Booker T. Washington High School and Birmingham's Parker High School, particularly if Parker lost. I knew the city later, as a participant in the modern civil
11
rights movement, as ""Bombingham"" because of the frequency of its explosive attacks on blacks. It became known throughout the nation and the world in 1963 as the site of a ferocious fight between the movement's nonviolent forces and the white resistance, and it was there that a bloody bomb ended the lives of four young girls.
In Birmingham's streets a drama unfolded that today typifies the entire civil rights movement for many: nonviolent protestors, many of them pre-school children, singing while they marched from the 16th Street Baptist Church into blasts of water fired from cannons whose power, it was said, could strip bark from trees and bricks from buildings.
Birmingham had a heritage of vicious race relations, summed up in 1960 by the New York Times' Harrison Salisbury.
He wrote:
""Whites and blacks still walk the same streets. But the streets, the water supply and sewer system are about the only public facilities they share. Ball parks and taxicabs are segregated. So are libraries. A book featuring black rabbits and white rabbits was banned. A drive is on to forbid 'Negro music' on 'white' radio stations. Every channel of communication, every medium of mutual interest, every reasoned approach, every inch of middle ground has been fragmented by the emotional dynamite of racism, reinforced by the whip, the razor, the gun, the bomb, the torch, the club, the knife, the mob, the police, and many branches of the state's apparatus.""
""In Birmingham, neither blacks nor whites talk freely. A
12
pastor carefully closes the door before he speaks. A Negro keeps an eye on the sidewalk outside his house. A lawyer talks in the language of conspiracy. Telephones are tapped, or there is fear of tapping. Mail has been intercepted and opened. Sometimes it does not reach its destination. The eavesdropper, the informer, the spy have become a fact of life.""7
Onto this scene came Dr. King. Within a few weeks he had placed Birmingham's rigid resistance to the movement's modest demands on the front pages of newspapers everywhere. The photographic evidence of the callousness of Birmingham's police and firemen, the embarrassment faced by some of Birmingham's businessmen and the pressures felt by President John F. Kennedy to stop internationally shameful displays of radical discord without seeming to do so, the relentless parade of protestors — all these combined to produce a truce.
Looking backward from today at the events which happened there, we can see the Birmingham of 1963 through others' eyes. Historians and movement participants alike have much to tell us about what was done and what it meant — to them then and to us today.
Despite the vivid descriptions of prize-winning historians and authors, there is much more to be learned about what happened in the Magic City in the Spring of 1963. That search requires the examination of hidden and obscured texts which celebrate the nameless and faceless people who made yesterday's civil rights struggle the mighty movement that it was.
13
The popular view of the Birmingham movement — children facing fire hoses and the leadership of Martin Luther King — obscures a larger level of participation and involvement that explains the democratic nature of the Southern struggle for human rights, and makes it possible for others elsewhere to create modern movements today.
A pilgrim today learns that Birmingham is eager to exploit its civil rights past. The city is home to a new Civil Rights Institute, opened in 1992. It is a wonderful structure, built with taxpayers' money, a remarkable fact in contrast to the hostility to protests in Birmingham just thirty-three years ago. A visitor to the Institute can learn much about what took place in the surrounding streets three decades ago, particularly why the movement was called a mass movement. Here one has a chance to learn much about heroes and heroism.
In a ledger the Institute has used as a visitors' book on and since its opening days are written the accounts of movement participants.
Those who signed were asked to record what they did — whether they marched, were arrested, or served in some capacity or capacities, many having engaged in more than one activity.8
In the cramped spaces of the 41 lines on the ledger's first page are found 36 names of those who marched in 1963's demonstrations, three who served as security guards, seven who said they were arrested and six who said they were jailed, two who served as committee members, two who served meals, and ten who
14
worked to register voters. The pages which follow list many more.
The book is the basis for the Civil Rights Institute's oral history project. Its sign-up sheets are the Birmingham movement's social register, a roster of who was who and who did what, a righteous roll call of the movement's nameless and forgotten. The listings are their testimony to their contribution, their description of what they did, an inventory of the protest movement, a catalog of what it took to make the movement in the Magic City work.
For these uncelebrated authors, in a few words, in sacrifice and suffering penned in cramped shorthand, the episodes they chose to record compose their Birmingham movement.
Empress Akweke-King, now of Brooklyn wrote: ""dog attacked.""
Rev. B. W. Henderson of Avenue O reports, ""house bombed on Sugar Hill."" Ruth Barefield-Pendleton of 2nd Street West ""marched Selma to Montgomery."" Doris Brewster of Riverchase Parkway simply wrote, ""hosed.""
Rodrick Hilson ""brought kids from Bessemer to Birmingham.""
In Arthur Lee Smith's account he ""acted as liaison between jail and headquarters (church)"".
Willie James Coleman boasts he was ""first to go to jail for park."" Sandra Johnson's brief narrative says simply, ""left school.""
Glenda Bailey of Adamsville remembers, ""heard blast at church from the Fountain Heights Methodist Church"".
Thirteen-year-old Virgil Ware could not sign in; he was killed on the afternoon of September 15, 1963, in the angry aftermath of
15
the dynamite blast Glenda Bailey heard. Riding on the handlebars of his brother's bicycle, he was shot by a 16-year-old white boy riding on the back of a motor scooter. Someone signing in for Virgil Ware wrote: ""Deceased. KKK killed him same day 16th Street Baptist was bombed.""
Flora Smith of Bessemer was ""chaplain in jail.""
Annie Mason describes herself as ""Miles College student; sat-in at 5 & 10."" Doris Matthews wrote, ""Tear gas/fire hose."" Bertha Willis, like so many others, was simply ""supporter.""
Not all who made the movement were black. Melva Jimerson, now of Washington, D. C., was ""part of Alabama Council on Human Relations."" Randall Jimerson, now of East Hampton, Connecticut, ""spoke out on civil rights issues with white students in Homewood.""
Many are modest. From Stafford, Vermont, William Sloane Coffin described himself simply as ""Freedom Rider.""
Will Eatman of Birmingham remembered, ""I was water down on 5th Avenue 17th Street.""
Mrs. Odessa Robinson ""marched — Selma to Montgomery.""
Johnnie M. Smith of Birmingham ""integrated churches.""
Elijah Hill of Birmingham wrote, ""yes — marched."" From Alabama's capitol, Barbara Howard wrote, ""Integrated/sit-ins/movie in Montgomery.""
Theophus C. Pogue of Anniston inscribed, ""Bus bombing Anniston 1961 May 14 witnessed.""
Vonelle Wilson, Grady Wilson and Jesse Wilson jointly declared ""spent 15 days in jail.""
16
Gloria Washington ""spent two weeks in jail, city juvenile, county fairground.""
Bernard Johnson's movement experiences are summarized in four words: ""Got hosed and dogs.""
George Moore Jr. ""got hosed in park.""
B. G. Evands writes, ""I was there bombing of church.""
Some served in other ways. Mrs. Rosie L. Craig was ""usher in the mass meetings."" William Upshaw of Laurel, Maryland, described himself as ""musician for mass movement."" Annye H. Braxton of Demopolis was proud to state: ""First black Marengo County to run for office.""
Luther McKinstry proudly reports, ""case won against U. S. Steel.""
Bernice Levert reported someone ""slam door in face at courthouse."" Rev. Clyde Johnco ""sued city for black policemen."" Martee McPherson ""worked with Justice Department at Gaston Motel."" Janet F. Horne of Cordele, Georgia, ""at 10 years of age member of SCLC sat at feet of Dr. Benjamin Mays.""
Jesse Champion Sr. ""lost job with Birmingham schools."" Jean Moore Steward of Birmingham simply ""didn't shop.""
For some, experiences outside the marches and meetings were important. Jimmie L. Terry's melancholy note reads, ""Son killed in Vietnam. First black to be buried in Elwood Cemetery.""
Frank Johnson's memory is being ""jailed with Dick Gregory.""
Of 467 signers through November 16, 1992, 69% had marched; 22% had been arrested.
17
After 25 pages, each page with 41 lines, each line defining a small space, each space filled with proud self-identifications of contributions made to breaching Alabama's rigid racial walls, of days in jail, of dogs and hoses, of marches and mass meetings, and explosions heard, of offices sought, of sons killed in war, of ushers and musicians and food servers, Steven Norris is the first to mention the man most Americans associate with Birmingham then and now.
Norris writes: ""In jail with Martin Luther King.""
""In jail with Martin Luther King!""
Here Steven Norris lists what must have been for him the significant moment of his involvement in the Birmingham campaign. His fellow authors had summed up their magic moments in other ways; they are the primary actors, only occasionally the acted upon. It is they who ""march(ed)"" or ""brought kids"" or ""were first"" to go to jail or were ""water(ed) down;"" they were attacked by dogs or hosed by firemen or simply ""spoke out"" where speaking out was dangerous.
These first 25 pages — and the others which follow — filled with the self description and identification of movement makers from Birmingham and Alabama thirty years ago — provide an excellent opportunity to examine the Birmingham movement anew ""from the bottom up""9, or in a more felicitous phrase, from the heart of the movement's mass.
These crisp descriptions recorded in Birmingham seem to me to represent sources at least as rich as answers often solicited by the professional interrogator whose best efforts must include some
18
distancing from his or her subject; these proud pronouncements claim responsibility for the changes which integrated Birmingham's downtown department stores in 1963 and that allowed the taxpayers of Birmingham and Jefferson County, Alabama, three decades later, to build a monument to the movement of 1963.
The writers of these testimonies are rich sources for historians and should be heroes to us all.
In their heroism, they do not stand alone. Most of those who made the movement were not famous; they were faceless. They were not the noted; they were the nameless — the marchers with tired feet, the protestors beaten back, the unknown women and men who risked job and home and life.
Let no one tell us their movement did not succeed.
Ask Hartman Turnbow, a black Mississippian, who said:
""Anybody hadda told me 'fore it happened that conditions would make this much change between the white and the black in Holmes County here where I live, why I'da just said, 'You're lyin'. It won't happen.'
""I just wouldn't have believed it. I didn't dream of it. I didn't see no way. But it got to workin' just like the citizenship class teacher told us — that if we would register to vote and just stick with it. He says it's goin' be some difficulties. He told us that when we started. We was lookin' for it. He said we gon' have difficulties, gon' have troubles, folks gon' lose their homes, folks gon' lose their lives, peoples gon' lose all their money, and just like he said, all of that happened. He didn't miss it. He
19
hit it ka-dap on the head, and it's workin' now. It won't never go back to where it was!""10
It succeeded in spite of Turnbow's ""difficulties"", in spite of what King called the brutality of a dying order shrieking across the land.
In its successes, it has much to teach us now.
Today, from Somalia and Haiti and Bosnia, the United States looks back at Vietnam to discover what went wrong. We can look back at yesterday's civil rights movement to discover what went right.
Yesterday's movement succeeded because victims became their own best champions. When Mrs. Rosa Parks refused to stand up, and when King stood up to preach, mass participation came to the movement for civil rights.
Today, too many of my students and too many others — young and old, black and white — believe they are impotent, unable to influence the society in which they live.
Three and a half decades ago, a mass movement marched, picketed, protested and organized and brought state sanctioned segregation to its knees.
One movement message is that people move forward fastest when they move forward together. Another lesson is that heroes need more than a passive audience if their heroism is to flourish. That audience provides a context for heroism, an encouraging and supportive cast for heroic deeds and a mirror for its valor.
King did not march from Selma to Montgomery by himself; he did not speak to an empty field at the March on Washington. There were
20
thousands marching with him, and before him, and thousands more who did the necessary work that preceded the triumphal march. Black Americans did not march to freedom; they worked their way to civil rights through the difficult business of organizing.
Registering voters, one by one. Organizing a community, block by block. Creating a black-led, interracial movement in which one hundred parts made up the successful whole.
The civil rights movement provides more than a century's history of aggressive self-help and voluntarism in church and civic club, assisting the needy and financing the cause of social justice, and an equally long and honorable tradition of struggle and resistance.
And it provides a lesson of hope, found as surely in Martin Luther King's famous dream as in the anonymous actions of the nameless many and in the testimonies written in the Institute's ledger in Birmingham.
Today's task for historians, museums, for us all is to broaden King's spotlight so the world may see the movement for civil rights in all its glory, may see all who played a part. Our duty is to communicate the hopefulness that made the movement possible, the optimism that conferred heroism on a population history does not acknowledge.
My grandfather's words, spoken at his college commencement 101 years ago, may help. He said then:
""The pessimist from his corner looks out upon the world of wickedness and sin, and blinded to all that is good or hopeful in the condition and progress of the human race, bewails the present
21
state of affairs and predicts woeful things for the future.""
""In every cloud he beholds a destructive storm, in every flash of lightening an omen of evil and in every shadow that falls across his path a lurking foe.""
""He forgets that the clouds also bring life and hope, that the lightning purifies the atmosphere, that shadow and darkness prepare for sunshine and growth, and that hardships and adversity nerve the race, as the individual, for greater efforts and grander victories.""11
History, hope and heroes. ""Greater efforts and grander victories.""
That was his generation's promise a century ago, our inheritance from the generation born as slaves. That was the promise made by the generation that won the great world war for democracy five decades ago. That is the modern movement's promise to us now.

The association of heroes with bravery is a limiting definition, I think, but says much about our current world.
In the American experience, our heroes are brave. They are most often men, and sometimes women, most frequently in war, and occasionally in peace, whose acts and deeds express the best in us al - the warrior or solider, George Washington and Daniel Boone, Davy Crockett Thomas Jefferson, and Abraham Lincoln, a collection of larger than life figures who captured the public mind.
They set standards which the rest of us try to emulate and imitate; and they grew at a time when the American frontier was real, danger apparent, and heroism a proper response.
When our nation was being born, our heroes were its creators. As the new nation pushed westward, our heroes were the frontiersmen. When the nation was torn over slavery, our hero was the martyred president. When the re-united nation went to war, our heroes were soldiers and their generals.
All these figures came to us through a popular press as eager then as now to manufacture and exaggerate. But the invention of the motion picture and its spreading popularity, the creating of
2
a single America of instantaneous, shared experience through radio, and then television, and the creation of celluloid heroes has, I think, changed our expectations of who our heroes can be.
Perhaps the biggest change has been in how we expect our heroes to look and sound. Radio, movies, and television celebrated bass - baritone voices. Eugene V. Debs and Theodore Roosevelt's high pitched voices cause nervous laughter when they are heard today. The application of a looks and sound test were a deeds test alone had sufficed altered who our heroes could be; the difference wasn't that the man or woman with squeaky voice or unattractive face was denied the hero's role, but that heroism was expected of those who looked and sounded the part.
Thus George Bush, a certified hero in World War II, remained a ""wimp"" in public perception despite a public life filled with service, which, if not heroic, was certainly laudable.
It was not until he directed American might and arms against the frightful dangers of the perilous Panamanians that he became a hero to most Americans; his voice and manner had denied him hero status until then.
Our heros, then, have changed as technology has changed our perceptions. That technology expanded the lists from which heroes may be drawn — today our heroes are as frequently found in weekly combat on the playing field as on the battleground.
John D. Rockefeller and J. P. Morgan were hardly heroes to my parents, generation; indeed, they were much despised ""special interests"", but today Michael Milliken and Ivan Boeskey
3
occupied hero status for many until their fall, and I suspect that for many they are heroes still.
And we confuse role model and hero; a hero may be a role model, but a role model isn't always a hero and often should not be.
Whatever the heroes, definition, we Americans have far too many of them. Our heroes cover every relationship from parent to President, every profession from jock to gladiator.
The oral tradition that transmitted heroic words and deeds from generation to generation has been replaced by the VCR; today we can fast forward through a modern hero,s life to get to the good parts.
We were once inspired by the telling; we are now inspired in the viewing.
Our heroes, then, have changed, from the buckskin clad backwoodsman to the Italian suited Wall Streeter, from the powdered wigged Founding Fathers to the jerry curled black sports star, from the white man to the Omni-American, drawn from the larger, more diverse population whose special achievements in sports, or business are as celebrated as yesterday,s heroics in war.
These figures — wherever we find them — serve not simply as standard setters for the rest of us; the popularization o f the hero - - indeed, the democratization of the hero - - reminds us that we may be heroes or heroic too.
That,s not the case with every hero, but it is true
4
with many, those created not by some special act of courage or daring but through clever manipulation of symbols.
Donald Trump, for example, a legend in his own mind, is undoubtedly a hero to many. His enormous wealth, flaunted in the media, beyond the reach of nearly every other American somehow seems tantalizingly near to those who read his book or play his game or somehow absorb his magic.
This is, nonetheless, an enormous public demand, a longing, for these figures, these mythical giants, these everymen become supermen, who are like us and greater than us at the same time.
The hero helps define our lives, but may help circumscribe them too. We demand heroes to do what we cannot do and consequently, it remains undone. We doom ourselves to inacticity, waiting in vain for a hero to emerge, to save or inspire us, to do for us what we cannot do for ourselves.
If nothing else, heroes remind us of what we might be, what we could be but now we cannot. The middle aged man who watched Michael Jordan perform knows he might have been another Michael, if h e had practiced more, or if his coach had been better or his father had been taller, if he'd not suffered from the dreaded ""white man's disease.""
The ghetto youngster knows he can be Michael Jordan; he already looks like Michael Jordan, he can stick his tongue between his teeth like Michael Jordan, and in his fantasies — and in his fantasies alone — he can perform like Michael Jordan. So Jordan a heroic equal opportunity
5
service — providing dreams of what might have been and what can be, setting standards admired in both suburb and inner city, creating visions that surpass the boundaries of black and white.
The athlete as hero transcends racial boundaries; . so, in his own way, does Martin Luther King.
King speaks in death and memory to white and Black Americans as he never did in life. In grainy film taken from his 1963 March on Washington speech, we hear again the measured, rhythmic cadence, we see the commanding presence, we hear the booming voice — and we all share that distant dream.
We honor King because of what he means in our imperfect memories - - the stoic who faced injury and death before howling mobs and the single figure of his period able to articulate for whites what Blacks wanted and for Blacks what would be expected if freedom was the prize.
But that King is a half a man, and the King we see is an blurred picture of the man who was.
The annual reappraisals of Martin Luther
King, his leadership, the movement he helped make, and most recently his personal character, have in what would have been his 66th year, taken a familiar path.
This ritual is not peculiar to Martin Luther King,s legacy; it instructs the remembrance of all our heroes.
From George Washington to John Kennedy we set those we enshrine in a near permanent place in our celebratory firmament; their glow may sparkle and flicker or may even dim, but the light
6
we receive from them remains essentially unchanged.
True, on rare occasion they may fall entirely from grace as if from on high; but Martin King seems secure, for now at least, as the premier fighter for freedom of the twentieth century, a hero to most of the world.
Briefly, he was born in 1929 in Atlanta,
Georgia, into the comfortable Black middle class. At 25, he had earned a Ph. D. degree from Boston University and was named paster of Dexter Avenue Baptist Church in Montgomery. A year later he had been chosen the leader of a one-day boycott of Montgomery,s city bus line, chosen, at least in part, because his brief tenure in Montgomery had earned him few enemies or suspicious alliances. When the boycott ended a year later, he had joined the small circle of nationally recognized civil rights leaders; his courageous leadership and his ability to articulate the longings and desires of Black Southerners to free themselves from the continuing brutalities and vulgarities of the apartheid system ensured his place in the national conscience.
But King quickly separated himself from the recognized national spokesmen of Black America. He alone among them urged militant mass action — rather than slow and plodding legal strategies — against segregation, he alone spoke of the power of nonviolent resistance and redemptive suffering.
By early 1957, he had organized the Southern Christian Leadership Conference to institutionalize his leadership and style of protest; he tested both in Albany,
7
Georgia in 196 .
By all accounts, that campaign was a failure. King could not overcome deep divisions within the national organizations which competed in Albany, and could not engage the federal government,s sympathy or active participation as an ally, nor could he arouse national indignation at official Albany,s violence against peaceful protests
If the Albany crusade failed, it taught lessons for the Birmingham battle that would follow, and there King achieved success.
King and SCLC were organizationally supreme in Birmingham; no national movement rivals challenged him as too militant or not aggressive enough. Unlike their abandoned struggle in Albany, King and his organizers presented a united front of unified demands, and skillfully used school-aged demonstrators whose buoyancy and vitally provoked the anticipated — and nationally televised— violence from local police.
An unwilling President Kennedy was drawn into the Birmingham drama; his negotiators helped to make a settlement possible. And King was to write his ""Letter From The Birmingham Jail"" which in frequent, later re-printing, would spread his message of Christian love and his incisive critique of moderation to a wide audience of influential Americans.
King,s dramatic speech at the March of Washington in August, 1963, cemented his place as first among equals in America,s civil
8
rights leadership. Like the beatings and fire-hosings in Birmingham, King,s Washington speech was televised; in a nation-wide mass meeting, an American audience was treated for the first time to the unedited oratory of America,s premier preacher, and for the first time, a mass white audience heard the undeniable justice of Black demands.
By 1965 King was at the apex of Black leadership; his success in Selma, success at again provoking violence and soliciting national revulsion which translated into federal action, marked him as the one man in America in clear leadership of what was being called the Negro revolution.
King,s leadership guaranteed its proponents would be peaceful and that the movement,s goals would remain inclusion into the American mainstream, but events and other movements began to intrude.
In December, 1964, King was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize — a distinct honor for the man and the movement.
In March of 1965, at Howard University, he voiced his first public opposition to the war in Vietnam; some months before, President Lyndon Johnson had lied to Congress to extract the power to make war without congressional declaration. Within months, 200,000 American soldiers were fighting there; by 1966, 200,000 more joined them. In mid-1965, a few hundred Americans gathered in Washington to protest the war; within a few years they numbered a hundred thousand, and among the protestors and resisters were active members of the civil rights movement in the
9
South.
King,s conscience could not avoid his involvement in the movement against the war, and that movement gave him a chance to define himself
""I,m much more than a civil rights leader,"" he said of himself in mid-1965, while insisting that his major focus would continue to be the struggle against Black oppression.
""The poverty issue,"" he added, ""is now the pressing one.""
He addressed that issue with an organizing campaign against slums in Chicago in 1965 and 1966, but found Chicago,s rigid politics suffocated the movement he tried to build. Still, he peppered his speeches with darts aimed at the Vietnam War, and spoke more openly and forcefully against what he called America,s ""vicious class system(s).""
""If our economic system is to survive,"" he told his congregation, ""there must be a better distribution of wealth... we can,t have a system where some people live in superfluous, inordinate wealth while others live in abject, deadening poverty.3
In the middle of King,s Chicago campaign, James Meredith was shot on a one-man march against fear through Mississippi; King and others took up the march. In a dusty - cotton field Stokeley Carmichael first shouted ""Black Power,"" and the hidden rift between King,s moderation and the militance of CORE and SNCC was
10
first revealed. ""Black Power"" did more than frighten whites and Black moderates; it divided support for the movement King led and gave sanction to those who thought American Blacks had already won enough.
The reaction to ""Black Power"" showed how easily pluralism is defined as separatism when the proponents, skins are Black; how pride became arrogance when nonviolent petitioner became militant demander.
King,s last years were marked by attitudinal changes — in Black America,s demands and white America,s response. In Montgomery, Blacks had asked for seats at an abundant table; they could gain and no one had to lose. As the movemented traveled north, many whites began to believe Blacks demanded the entire table for themselves.
King interrupted preparations for a Poor People,s March on Washington to help striking sanitation workers in Memphis; he was in Memphis when he was assassinated on April 4, @968.
The violence he had fought against in life, but used so skillfully to win sympathy and civil rights in the South, erupted throughout America in the aftermath of his murder.
Eighteen years later, President Ronald Reagan reluctantly signed the law that made King,s birthdate a national holiday, and today schoolchildren across America know part of the story of Martin Luther King.
The story they do not know is what makes making heroes the peculiar process that it is. They do not know, for example, the
11
true history of the United States from which King grew.
Martin Luther King,s America — and ours — was built on a slavery system more advanced and brutal than any in the Western Hemisphere; what had been ""a culture with a racist ideology""4 became ""a chronically racist culture"" after Emancipation.5
That-culture punished Blackness and rewarded whiteness, unifying all who found themselves ""within the Caucasian chalk circle,""6 and continued offering reward and punishment based on pigmentation well until the 1990s.
The movement King led helped destroy the legal system which was the underpinning for that culture; that is why we honor Martin Luther King today.
Note that we do not honor the severe critic of capitalism and its excesses. We do not honor the pacifist who preached that all wars were evil, who said a nation which chose guns over butter would starve its people and kill itself. We do not honor the man who linked apartheid in South Africa and South Alabama. We honor an antiseptic hero.
He could not have dreamed his birthday would be a national holiday, that children of all races would spend the days before and after January 15 each year declaiming his March on Washington speech, learning about Rosa Parks and the boycott in
12
Montgomery.
And he could not have dreamed he,d be considered by many to be a hero, for if he knew he was worshiped in life, he thought that worship vainglorious and misplaced.
He knew — and we have been recently reminded by — his human failings.
But human failings do not always diminish our heroes. They can endear them. Martin Luther King,s heroic status, built on selective views of the whole man, aptly demonstrates the function heroes serve and the ends toward which they are aimed.
Our imperfect picture of the man called King is deliberate; we would not honor the whole man, would not give him the hero,s status.
It is not the private life of the public man that would give us pause; it is instead the full public life of the public man which would disqualify him from deification in our eyes. When the nation,s leaders lied us into criminal war in Southeast Asia, Martin Luther King said no.
When the powerful tried to limit him to discourse on race, he insisted on his right to an opinion on any subject affecting the human condition.
When he saw growing gaps between rich and poor, he insisted society could be ordered in a fairer way, that wealth distributed more evenly.
Because these opinions remain controversial today — applied to Vietnam then and Bosnia now, to capitalism then or
13
capitalism now — we have stripped King of them, leaving him wrapped in the universal robes of racial conciliation, of equal rights, of nonviolent civil wars where no one loses and everyone wins.
Even the most vigorous opponents of equal rights in recent administrations could find a King quote to disguise their racial chauvinism.
During Dr. King's life, there were many objections raised about his deification; these bear repeating at the annual occasion when imprecise memories of the man are summoned once again.
We know of Martin Luther King because of the Montgomery Bus Boycott; he was chosen for a leadership role in that boycott by a man named E.D. Nixon.
Mr. Nixon and Martin Luther King were opposites. Nixon had years of experience in Montgomery's racial wars; King had lived there less than a year. Nixon as a former President of the Montgomery NAACP, current President of the statewide NAACP and President of Alabama Brotherhood of Sleeping Car Porters. King had just turned down a chance to run for Montgomery NAACP President.
Nixon was 56; King was 26. King had a BA from Morehouse College, a degree from Crozier
Theological Seminary, and a Ph D. Degree from Boston University; Nixon embarrassed many of Montgomery,s Blacks through his broken English and his roughhewn ways.
14
But Nixon helped choose King to lead the Montgomery movement, seeing in the university trained minister something he knew he and others did not see in himself. And Rosa Parks, whose heroism was that movement's inspiration, retreated — she became the movement's mother—in the '50s mothers were seen and not heard. As King,s prominence in the movement grew, King-worship became a tool for many; for some of us, however, over-dependence on any one man was a dangerous tendency that would suppress local leadership, denying it a chance to learn and grow.
The standard of heroic, single leadership that had characterized Black protest before the mass movement of the 1960s contributed to the earlier movement,s failures, much as today,s celebration of single figures acts to deny responsibility and a helpful role to the mass of women and men.
The larger culture is most guilty of this crime; recall the insistence following the election of Douglas Wilder on his replacing Jesse Jackson as maximum leader of Black America, a role assigned to Jackson by a nation hungering for another Martin Luther King.
No other group of Americans — not whites, Hispanics, Jews, women, Italians — no one figure dare speak for any of these.
Group-centered leadership helped push the civil rights movement into places single leadership feared to go; it made ordinary women and men realize their own potential for leadership, and it was democracy at its best. A rigid McCarthyism had crippled the progressive
15
movement; group centered civil rights leadership refused to submit to political tests. Consensual leadership and group decision-making are the hallmarks of democracy. The deification of leadership, living and dead, is often the death of creativity, of boldness.
We opposed the veneration of living women and men, connected hero worship with idolatry, and fought against the notion of a human savior who would deliver us from evil.
The great men and women of human history stand astride the humble many; but it is the many who make the few. sisters who playfully called Dr. King ""de Lawd"" and it is the lesson of successful movements today.
We are right to celebrate individual acts of courage and strength But we are wrong to suggest that acts essential to saving lives on a battlefield or to scoring touchdowns on a football field are the.same@ as acts which end genocide against a people. Moral leadership requires great courage. That courage — heroism of the highest order — is in small supply today.
Heroic figures fill a real need for many Americans. They set standards to which we may all aspire. Quite often, however, we adopt heroes - - sports stars or entertainment figures - - whose most admirable talent is far beyond our capacity. These heroes remain distant. We often imbue heroes with mystical and magical properties, as we have
one with Martin Luther King, and in granting him the ability to
16
sever the restrictions of the segregated past, deny the existence of the truly heroic mass movement which actually brought the end to legal apartheid in the American South.
If we needed Martin Luther King to set us free then, we need him just as badly now. We are King dependent, without a King-figure. We may have his heroic example before us but have none among us who can follow it now.
Martin Luther King was heroized because his words and deeds enveloped a mighty mass movement, people's power at its best. The movement defined King, and King defined the movement for the world. The man and movement coincided at a special movement in our history. Today's moment lacks the man, but the movement is there to be built by the many. Without such a movement, King's obituary will be ours.
Written on his tomb are these words:
""Behold, here comes the dreamer. Let us slay him, and we shall see what will become of his dream.""7
What becomes of our hero's dream is up to all of us.
""The Luxury of Integrity""
It is doubtless necessary that there should be frequent crucifixions. It seems to be the way of the world. A man to whom the truth is blazed as clear as noon goes out into the streets filled to the lips with his revelation. Smug citizens avoid him, put up their shutters; dogs bark at his heels;
17
the ribald gather, one throws a stone.
""Then comes the storm upon him, in which he falls, battered, bleeding, with glazed eyes. There's an end of the blasphemer who dares question established order, who says that use and wont are not sacred at all, but hoary ininiquity.
""Having slain him, they learn that he was a god, and his revelations a law of nature. Up goes a statue, and his words as read as gospel. That's how we get on in this quaint world, climbing up the stars on the heaped bodies of our heroes and sages. It's no use quarreling with it.""

The Month was begun in 1926 as Negro History Week. It was initially celebrated largely in segregated Southern black schools – one reason older Southern-born black people know more about themselves and their past than their grandchildren do. However underfunded and understaffed. These schools were responsive to their students. They tried to teach the basics – reading, writing, arithmatic and history – but also tried to make sure that Negro History was a constant part of the curriculum too.
Thus long before I heard the word diversity applied to education or the workplace. I knew a black man invented the machine that made the shoe industry possible and another had designed the city of Washington, another had invented the traffic light and another had discovered blood plasma. Long before I ever dreamed the nation would celebrate a black man’s birthday – indeed long before I had heard of or even met that man – my teachers in rural one-room schools with outhouses made sure I knew who I was and where I came from and what contributions my people had made.
We also learned how to think.
2
We didn’t learn that Columbus had discovered America, but that Columbus discovered America for Europe; those who met him didn’t need discovering; they already knew it was here.
We knew the textbooks which described the Civil War as “a war of Northern aggression” or said the war was fought over state’s rights were just plain wrong. The war was fought over whether our great-grandfathers and mothers would be someone else’s property. And when years later, we were told that the war in Vietnam was “a war of Northern aggression”, we knew we had heard that phrase somewhere before.
We’ve come a long way since I was a schoolboy. Our common national understanding of our past and present is generally greater now than it was then, even if all the details aren’t crystal clear. And our understanding of history is clearer, even though we still argue over what that history means.
One part of the history we know more about is the history of the mid-century movement for civil rights. Whether called that, or the black struggle or the freedom fight, we know more about it now than ever before.
In a few years, for example, we will have a pretty clear understanding of what Martin Luther King did and said and thought and where he was nearly every week of his life between the beginning of the Montgomery Bus Boycott in 1955 until his murder in Memphis in 1968.
This increase in our knowledge about one of the 20th Century’s most notable figures has come about, at least in part, because of the continued and increased interest among Americans 
3
in King, in the movement associated with him, and the times which produced him and other notable figures in our common past.
The film-maker Oliver Stone has cleverly capitalized on this interest, in his new movie JFK. Both those Americans who can remember where they were when Kennedy was killed and those who know of the murdered President only second-hand are drawn to examine what happened in Dallas that November day, to wonder who did it and why.
For the last several years I have been a History teacher, telling college students about the great movement for civil rights that swelled to prominence in the 1950s and 1960s.
Some of my students confuse George Wallace, the Governor of Alabama in the 1960s, with Mike Wallace, the television newsman then and now. Others confuse Montgomery NAACP leader F. D. Nixon with former President Richard Nixon.
What and how I teach reflects a great shift in historiography, a rethinking of by whom and how the civil rights movement was made.
Looking at that movement from today, we see a different view of the events and personalities of that period.
Instead of the towering figures of Kings and Kennedys standing alone, we now see an army of women and men.
Instead of famous speeches to multitudes, we now see the planning and work that made the march.
Instead of a series of well publicized marches and protests. We see instead long organizing campaigns and brave and lonely soldiers often working in near solitude.
4
And instead of a sudden upsurge in activism in Montgomery in 1955, we see a long and unceasing history of challenges to white supremacy that began in slavery.
When we look back at our times from the 21st Century, what will we see?  
If we look at today – at the 1980s and early 1990s – through the same lens we used to use to examine the 1950s and 1960s, we may well see only the electoral and ideological victories and Ronald Reagan and George Bush.             
In that narrow view, Ronald Reagan discovered a cultural and electoral backlash against the 1960s and rode it to power. Once in office, he and his successor institutionalized their revolution, discrediting and then weakening the government’s efforts to help the poor and powerless, strengthening the effort to reward the rich and powerful.
But Ronald Reagan and George Bush did not create the politics that gave them power, however skillful they become at exploiting racial fears and selfishness.
Instead, they should be seen as the natural descendents and heirs of two centuries of racial politics, modern-day proponents of are ancient series of arguments against equality.
More than 35 years ago, for example, whites in Montgomery used arguments against integrating the busses that were the same as those employed against the civil rights bill of last year.
Giving in to black demands would give blacks a special status over white people they do not deserve. Having a court order integrate the busses would make blacks wards of the 
5
state. Insistence on integration robbed blacks of racial pride. And most importantly, upsetting traditional patterns of white supremacy and black inferiority would alienate whites, destroying an imaginary conception of racial harmony that existed in the segregated world.
It isn’t hard to recall hearing versions of those arguments on the floor of the United States Senate last year.
We don’t have to go back to Montgomery 37 years ago.
In 1962 Connecticut Senator Prescott Bush ended his Senate service by introducing a civil rights bill stronger than proposals made by President Kennedy. A year later, and two weeks after Martin Luther King’s famous “I Have A Dream” speech at the March on Washington. George Bush kicked off his first race for public office by opposing Kennedy’s civil rights bill. He was “emphatically” against the section that would force hotels and restaurants to admit blacks, he told Texas newspapers.1
Young George Bush was no stranger to the argument that equality for blacks hurt whites. Bush told Texas voters he would work to develop job opportunities for those “displaced from jobs. . . by the new civil rights act.”2
“The new civil rights act was passed to protect 14% of the people,” candidate Bush said. “I’m also worried about the other 86%.3
6
Recycling arguments against equality comes naturally in a society that has long embraced the ideal but not the reality of diversity.
If there has been a frightening consistency to the arguments made by opponents of equality, the supporters of justice have been consistent too.
For all of this century, the movement for civil and human rights has followed the program put forth by W.E.B. Dubois in 1905:
“We must complain,” he said. “Yes plain, blunt complaint, ceaseless agitation, unfailing exposure of dishonestly and wrong – this is the ancient unerring way to liberty, and we must follow it. . . .”
“Next, we propose to work. These are the things that we as Black men must try to do. To press the matter of stopping the curtailment of our political rights; to urge Negroes to vote honestly and effectively; to push the matter of civil rights; to organize business cooperation; to build schoolhouses and increase the interest in education; to bring Negroes and labor unions into mutual understanding; to study Negro History; to attack crime among us . . . to do all in our power by word and by deed to increase the efficiency of our race, the enjoyment of its manhood rights, and the performance of its just duties. This is a large program. It cannot be realized in a short time. . . . (But) this is the critical time.”4
7
DuBois correctly predicted then that the struggle of the 20the Century would be the struggle of the color line.
From before DuBois’ time until today, Black Americans have generally followed his prescription for action, pursuing civil rights, economic justice, and entrance into the mainstream of American life.
The years since then saw gains won at lunch counters and movie theatres and polling places, and the fabric of legal segregation was destroyed. What had begun as a movement for elemental civil rights has now become largely a political and an economic movement.
Despite impressive increases in the number of Black people holding public office, and despite our ability to sit and eat and ride and vote in places which used to bar Black faces, in some ways non-white Americans are worse off in the present than in the years that went before.
4 years ago, when the final phase of the 1988 presidential campaign formally began, both George Bush and Michael Dukakis saw an America too many Americans never see.
For both candidates, America was a land of happy families and successful suburbs, where every child waves an American flag and every day is the Fourth of July.
But there was then and is now another America, a shadow America neither candidate dared to show or tell.
As the ‘80s began, the nation chose a president whose terms could hold awful parallels with Reconstruction almost exactly 100 years before. Then and now, a president, desperate for power, 
8
entered into an illicit arrangement, not just with the unreconstructed South, but with the national unreconstructed majority, which believed then as it does now that private profit and public arrogance could be pursued at the expense of those living on the economic edge.
The 1980 election was won by an amiable incompetent whose sole intent was removing the government from every aspect of American life. He intended to take the government out of the business of enforcing equal opportunity. He intended to eliminate affirmative action for women and minorities. He intended to erase the laws and programs written in blood and sweat in the quarter century since Martin Luther King became the premier figure in the freedom movement and an American majority became single-minded in pursuit of human freedom.
For the Reaganites, conflict of interest became a precondition for employment in government. A band of financial and ideological profiteers descended on Washington like a crazed swarm of right-wing locusts bent on destroying the rules and laws which protected our people from bigotry, from poisoned air and water, from greed. But nowhere was their assault on the rule of law so great as in their attempt to subvert, ignore, defy and destroy the laws which require an America that is bias free.
A constituency of the comfortable, the callous and the smug was recruited to form solid ranks against the forgotten. They enforced the national nullification of the needs of the needy, the gratuitous gratification of the gross and the greedy and practiced the politics of prevarication, pious platitudes and 
9
self-righteous swinishness. They forced a form of triage economics upon us, producing the first increase in infant mortality rates in twenty years and pushing thousands of poor and working poor Americans deeper into poverty. By mid-term, the Census Bureau reported that the number of people living in poverty had increased over the previous four years by more than nine million, the biggest increase since these statistics were first collected over two decades ago. Today the poorest two-fifths of our population receives a smaller share of the national income and the richest two-fifths a larger share than at any time since 1947. If we are to believe with Thomas Jefferson that “the common man is the most precious resource of the state,” that precious resource is in real danger of economic extinction today.
The increased American interference in the lives of our neighbors in this hemisphere and in other countries around the globe. Criminal invasion in Grenada, U.S. sponsored terrorism in Nicaragua and Angola, encouragement of white supremacy in South Africa – these are the legacies of the Reagan years, the decade of the dominance of greed.
Those years were a festive party, thrown for America’s rich.
The middle class got by on two paychecks, median family income was stagnant, and the percentage of young families who own their own homes went down for the first time since the depression. The poorest tenth of the population saw their income fall by 10%. Young men between 25 and 34 saw their hourly wages drop by nearly a dollar. More Americans were working longer hours at lower pay.
10
Savings and investment were down in the Reagan years.
Despite low numbers of Americans unemployed, the percentage living in poverty remained the same, higher than in any years in the 1970s. 
And for those Americans whose skins are black or brown, the poverty rate went up while median family income went down. For children of any color, the numbers living in poverty doubled by 1987. Poverty for Black and Hispanic senior citizens went up, poorer children got poorer, and the gap between rich and poor grew wider.
After a twenty year decline, infant mortality rates for Blacks went up.
By 1986, the wealth of the average white family was twelve times the wealth of the average Black family. In 1969, three fourths of all Black men were working; by the 80’s end, only 57% had a job.
For these families, it isn’t morning in America. The only shining points of light they see are daylight through the cracks in their walls.
Permit me to speak as we go with two voices – first as a contemporary fellow passenger on what promises to be a tough and frustrating trip from the present toward the Twenty-first Century, and secondly, as a witness and participant in an earlier leg of that journey, a trip whose stops include Selma and Saigon, Jackson and Johannesburg, a trip which will take us from Ole Miss to U. Mass., from Bull Connor’s dogs to Ronald Reagan’s judges, from the Ku Klux Klan to Neo-Nazis and the Posse Comitatus, from 
11
Brown v. Board of Education to Ward’s Cove Packing Co. v. Antonio, from James Earl Ray to Bernard Goetz, and David Duke, from bombs in Birmingham to bigotry in Boston to a bombing in Birmingham to a beating in Los Angeles.    
In many ways, the Southern freedom movement was a second Reconstruction, whose ripples were felt far beyond the Southern states and whose victories benefited more than Blacks.
Like the first, almost exactly 100 years before, it focused on making the civil rights protections of America’s half citizens secure. Like the first, it saw gains for Blacks extended to protections for others. Like the first, it gave new life to movements of other disadvantaged Americans, and like the first Reconstruction, the second ended when the national purpose wavered and reaction swept the land.
Before it ended, it was our democracy’s finest hour. A voteless people voted with their bodies and their feet, and showed the way for other social protest. The anti-war movement drew its earliest soldiers from the Southern freedom army; the movement for women’s rights took many of its cues, and its momentum, from the Southern movement for civil rights.
These three impediments to democracy’s success – gender, race and abusive power – were all weakened by the movement’s drive, and we are all better for it today.
Important steps in the movement came in the summer of 1954.
In April 1954, Martin Luther King, Jr., preached his first sermon as pastor of Dexter Avenue Baptist Church. He was twenty-five years old. He could not have known that in nine years, he 
12
would be the most famous Black American, speaking at the March on Washington to the largest gathering of civil rights supporters in American History. And he could not have known that in 14 years he would be dead.
Ten days after the first sermon, the French forces in a far-away garrison called Dien Ben Phu were overcome. None of us imagined then that 55,000 American men would die in Vietnam.
Ten days after the French fell, legal segregation began to fall as well; the United States Supreme Court ruled on May 17, 1954, that segregated public schools were against the law. The Court’s ruling destroyed segregation’s legality, and an army of nonviolent protesters quickly arose to challenge its morality as well.
A year and a half after Martin Luther King arrived in Montgomery, another Black woman was arrested for refusing to give her seat to a white man on a city bus. One year and five days after Rosa Parks’ arrest, a young lawyer named Nelson Mandela was arrested in South Africa. Mrs. Parks’ arrest in Montgomery triggered a year-long bus boycott that broke the back of 
13
segregation in Montgomery, and the inspiration of the Montgomery movement set nonviolent fires in towns and cities across the south. 
In 1960, college students adopted the Montgomery technique of nonviolent resistance, and thousands accepted jail without bail by sitting down to stand up for their rights.
The next year, they attacked segregated interstate travel with their bodies and segregated ballot boxes across the South as well.
There were lives lost along the way, and laws passed; by 1965 Jim Crow was legally dead.
After the successes of the 1960s, the movement for civil rights faltered in the 1970s and has been in stages of advance and retreat ever since.
Today we see a very different picture, a population largely indifferent to the poverty around them, a people more concerned about trapped whales in Alaska than babies trapped in poverty in Alabama.
But the current threat to civil rights comes not from Southern sheriffs or bombs, but from the national government and the White House itself.
But beginning in 1981, they discovered a heretofore unknown protected class, white men, and directed their efforts toward protecting the benefits of this beleaguered and helpless group.
In the 1980s, they made dangerous, precipitous and radical shifts toward contravening the Constitution and the law of the land.
14
Ronald Reagan had never seen a civil rights law he liked; his appointees to the federal courts and the Department of Justice were determined to destroy or disobey every civil rights law they read. They made dangerous, precipitous and radical shifts toward contravening the Constitution and the law of the land.
The ultimate result of such policy was contempt for the rule of law itself. Had they prevailed, our constitutional rights would have been protected only when they were popularly agreed to, or when a person who supports them was elected President of the United States.
For the past and present Administrations, the Constitution is a document of infinite elasticity, to be tailored and snipped to fit the passions of the moment.
The record is appalling. It reveals official lawlessness, a retreat from bipartisan policies practiced in the past, and an ignorance of law that would have been frightening in a private practitioner; when, however the wrong-doers were the President and Attorneys General of the United States, the rule of law itself was threatened and an appeal made to the lowest and basest instincts of our people.
The Reagan years saw attempts to give tax breaks to segregated schools; opposition to renewal of the Voting Rights Act followed by a cynical claim of credit for its passage; the trashing of the Civil Rights Commission; the transformation of the Civil Rights Division of the Department of Justice into a society for the protection of white male privilege; the halting 
15
of integration of public schools; strident attacks on that part of the federal judiciary that still sought to protect minority rights.
The human costs of these actions are beyond measure. When the government becomes the aggressor against the civil rights of its people, it becomes the promoter of prejudice and makes common cause with the stain of white supremacy that has persisted throughout our History. 
Despite this dreary record, there were successes, and the bipartisan Congressional majority on civil rights remained intact.
In one sense, the movement has succeeded beyond its original sponsors’ wildest dreams or fears.
Racists in Congress tried to kill the 1964 Civil Rights Act by loading it with what they thought was a laughable and ridiculous protected class – gender.
They could not have imagined how problematic their expansion of civil rights protection would become.
One result was shown in the Supreme Court’s 1989 Richmond, Virginia, set-aside decision. The Court set as strict a standard for racism’s cures as for racism’s causes; that is a standard sex discrimination has never been required to meet.
What cruel irony it would be if women gain a greater measure of protection from the Reagan court than Blacks when women’s woes were once intended to kill civil rights protections for all. 
Today, through administrative order, court decisions and legislative act, the protected classes extend to a majority of 
16
all Americans, including white ethnics, the aged, short people, the chemically dependent, the left-handed, the obese, all religions. We ought to examine how the road to equal rights became so crowded – and what the consequences are.
Obviously, something is wrong when the claims of the descendants of property sold in the African slave trade are held equal with the claims of short, chemically dependent, left-handed white men.
Many ethnic, racial, religious, and other groups have legitimate grievances. The central moral dilemma of this nation, however is how it treats the one group whose members it enslaved. The law has a special obligation to Blacks – as the sole beneficiaries of the Thirteenth Amendment – when it comes to defining and remedying discrimination.
When a limited number of awards is demanded by a limitless number of claimants, then civil rights are as threatened today as they were by Bull Connor 25 years ago.
A second front against racial justice was opened in the 1980s and has gained strength ever since. Led by scholars and academicians, funded by corporate America, this movement of neo-conservatives aimed its efforts at removing government regulation from every aspect of our lives, and found a handy hated target in civil rights.
While professing strong support for equal rights, these neo-Bourbons opposed every tool devised to achieve that goal. They discredited affirmative action, not only because it threatened ancient skin privilege, but because it served as an easy symbol 
17
of despised government intervention.
For these new racists, equal opportunity is a burden society cannot afford to bear. Their less than subtle message is that including blacks and women excludes quality.
The truth is that true equality requires an increase in unwanted competition these new States’ Righters cannot stand; their oldboy networks, in academia or in industry, cannot tolerate federal imposition of equal rights.
They argue that the civil rights laws of the 1960s eliminated all discrimination, that the playing field is now level, that every contestant stands equal at the starting line.
That some contestants have no shoes, that others find their legs gripped by heavy baggage from the past, and that an advantaged few begin the race at the finish line is of no consequence to these champions of the new order.
The movement today suffers not from its imagined excesses, but from the lies and distortions of its opponents.   
They tell us discrimination against minorities is not a problem; society must protect itself from discrimination against the majority instead. They tell us school teachers and unemployed mothers are “special interests”. They tell us civil rights remedies produce civil wrongs.
They tell us class, not race, produces racial inequity, that culture, not color, separates Black from White.
They tell us America is color blind, but a recent national survey tells us that the majority of whites believe Blacks and Hispanics prefer welfare to work, are lazier than whites, and are 
18
more prone to violence, less intelligent, and less patriotic.
These new obstructionists reject the intergenerational effects of racism as a cause of disadvantage; discrimination is dead, they say, and cannot be at fault, but blacks will suffer disadvantage as long as they exhibit discrimination’s badges.
When the topic is Black unemployment rates ‐ twice those for whites ‐ past and present bias plays no role. But when the subject is welfare burdens or other so called “pathologies,” these neo‐segs never tire of listing the cumulative effects of our racist past.
Yesterday’s movement has been criticized ‐ in the perfect hindsight of today ‐ for winning gains for middle class blacks alone, but middle class blacks in Montgomery did not ride the city’s busses, and college professors and bankers in Greensboro did not eat their lunch at the five and ten.
Someone needs to disabuse the modern world of the notion that the beneficiaries of race‐centered affirmative action are somehow “profiting” from it, as if the movement’s goals were an investment shared by a greedy few ‐ a subtribe of ebony Ivan Boeskys trading up life’s ladder. There is no ‘profit’ in receiving right treatment. Receiving rights others already enjoy is no special benefit or badge of priviledge; it is the natural order of things in a democratic society.
The continuing disparity between black and white life‐chances is a result of epidemic racism and an economic system dependent on class division.
Abundant scholarship notwithstanding, there is no other 
19
possible explanation ‐ not family breakdown, not lack of middle class values, not lack of education or skills, not absence of role models.
These are symptoms. Racism is the cause; its elimination is the cure.
The last item on the civil rights agenda ‐‐ economic justice ‐‐ remains unfulfilled and unaddressed.
Martin Luther King lost his life supporting a garbage workers’ strike in Memphis; the right to decent work at decent pay is as important as the right to vote.
“Negroes,” King said in 1961, “are almost entirely a working people. There are pitifully few Negro millionaires and few Negro employers.5
That there are more Black millionaires today is a tribute to the movement King lead; that there are proportionally fewer blacks working today is an indictment of our times and our economic system, a reflection of our failure to keep the movement coming on.
The first years of the kinder, gentler administration only reminds us how much things remain the same.
The names have changed, but not the actions and the assault on racial equity continues with just as much determination as before. 
The President began by choosing as the nation’s chief civil rights lawyer a man most Americans would not choose to represent
20
them in People’s Court; he continues a performance that is loud in rhetoric but lacks execution through his dismaying attitude toward the Civil Rights Act of 1991 and his nomination of Clarence Thomas to the Supreme Court.
If the 1990s promise expanded freedoms in Eastern Europe and South Africa, we have a right to ask what we can expect at home.
We were right to celebrate the death of totalitarianism overseas, but the early warning signs of collapse here at home may mean we cannot crown capitalism king just yet.
Twice before in the twentieth century we saw the private economy unable to cope with the challenges it faced.
Six decades ago we embraced an aggressive, interventionist government when the private economy proved unable to beat back the depression and put wages into people’s pockets once again.
We embraced an activist government again when it became clear that the capitalist system had failed to moderate or restrain the privation which afflicted one in every five Americans just three decades ago.
Government’s efforts worked then; they reduced poverty by more than half and relieved some of poverty’s grimmest conditions – malnutrition, poor housing, ill health. They provided successful job training, raising the economic level of thousands of Americans. They provided early education for low-income children, increasing their chances for success in life. They increased visits by the poor to doctors, and they cut our sub-standard housing stock in half.
The message from the Congress and the White House is not
21
encouraging.
The President’s State of the Union speech continued the reverse Robin Hood traditions of the Reagan years; squeezing the needy to fatten the greedy. Between Bush and Reagan; there’s not a new paradigm’s worth of difference.
The Democrats have forgotten how to be an opposition. They read the President’s lips too, but seem unable to form words or progress of their own.
There is no courage on Capitol Hill; coalitions of the comfortable have replaced the notion that our society could be organized in a kinder, gentler way.
Today Black Americans face conditions as daunting as the fire hoses and billy clubs of thirty years ago.
An Urban League report tells us that Blacks lost, not gained ground in the 1980s.
And on the streets and sidewalks where black America lives, crime and violence rule.
Homicide is the leading cause of death for 15 to 34‐year‐old black men and women, and 95% of the murders are black‐on‐black crimes.
These are not drive‐by shootings or strangers killing strangers; in most of these deaths the killer and victim know each other. These are friend shooting friend.
In life chances, life expectancy, years of education completed, median income ‐ in all the standards by which life is measured, black Americans see a deep and widening gulf between the American dream and the reality of their lives.

For the past decade, an often indifferent and sometimes hostile federal government helped to widen the gap; today the neo‐segregationist majority on the Supreme Court denies minorities and women relief in the federal courts.
Court decisions and presidential indifference send a signal to the rest of America; to business and labor and education.
For nearly all of the last twenty years, the old interracial coalition that championed civil rights at Selma’s bridge and in Congress’ halls has been in retreat.
We knew we had lost a champion with the death of Martin King; we never imagined support for equal rights would die as well.
Martin Luther King isn’t the only soldier missing from the freedom fight; he was part of an army that numbered tens of thousands.
While all valued his leadership, few waited for his direction before an attack on segregation began
In every city where he mounted a campaign, a viable local movement existed long before King brought his leadership to the scene.
In countless southern towns, agressive anti‐segregation activity had a History that began in slavery time.
Today we wait for others to sanction our protests, to lead us. Yesterday’s movement was a people’s movement. It produced leaders of its own; but it relied not on the noted but the nameless, not on the famous but the faceless.
We look back on the King years with some nostalgia, for 
23
those were the years when we were truly able to overcome.
Our inability to do so today is conditioned, at least partially, by the way we recall Martin Luther King.
For most of us, Martin Luther King is an image seen in grainy, black and white television film taken in Washington a quarter of a century ago, the gifted preacher who had a dream.
But Martin Luther King was more than that, and the movement more than Martin Luther King.
King did more than tell the nation of his dream at the March on Washington.
In the years before and after he addressed the human condition, the larger world beyond America’s shores.
King came from a long tradition of Black leadership in America, leadership which never felt limited to Black civil rights alone.
In some ways, we have become King ‐ dependent, summoning his memory as a substitute for action.
But we forget that he stood at the head of thousands, the people who made that mighty movement what it was.
From Jamestown’s slave pens to Montgomery’s boycotted busses, these ordinary men and women labored in obscurity, and from Montgomery forward they provided the soldiers of the freedom army.  
They walked to work in dignity, rather than ride in shame. They faced mobs in Birmingham and death in Mississippi. They sat at lunch counters, and they stood and marched and organized.
Martin Luther King didn’t march from Selma to Montgomery by 
24
himself. He didn’t speak to an empty field at the March on Washington. 
There were thousands marching with him, and before him, and thousands more who one by one and two by two did the dirty work that preceded the triumphal march.
Black Americans didn’t just march to freedom; they worked their way toward civil rights through the difficult business of organizing. Knocking on doors, one by one. Registering voters, one by one. Developing a community effort, block by block. Creating an effective organization, town by town. Producing indigenous leadership, often unlettered and inarticulate, but always unafraid.
Today we look to others to lead and direct us; yesterday we told the leaders where the people were, what the people wanted the leaders to do.
There is an enormous opportunity for service available to each of us, wherever and whoever we may happen to be.
From the Girl Scouts and Boys’ Club to the PTA and the local political club, from the NAACP to congressional campaigns ‐ there’s nowhere willing hands and minds aren’t welcome, nowhere they will be turned away.
Most of us here are or will be successful in our lives. Many went before us to smooth our way, and our job is to smooth the way for those who come behind us.
Building such a movement is a difficult, but not impossible task; surely every one of us wants to have a say in deciding our common fate.
25
There can be no better prescription for relieving this current crisis, and for reviving some interest in it, than by recreating a non‐partisan, national coalition of need, of parents who want care, not warehousing for their children; of workers who want work at a decent and protected wage; of people who work for their living and can’t live on what they make as well as those who can’t find work but can’t live on what we so grudgingly give; of all those people who want an end to welfare and capitalism for the poor and subsidy and socialism for the wealthy and all who must learn that sufficiency for those at the bottom is compatible with stability for those in the middle ‐‐ all those people now live in America, divided now by race and class, fearful of each other, contentious and impotent.
An entire political movement came to near maturity in America in the Sixties. Fueled by the fire from the Southern Civil Rights Movement and the national anti‐war drive, drawing leadership from the grassroots, it threatened to challenge the foundations of racial and economic arrogance that had created vast reservations of the unwanted on this country’s soil.
That movement became the partial victim of its own success. It fought for and won the right to sit in front of the bus, to cast a vote, to sit at a lunch counter. It launched a southern Black political movement, but it failed to sustain and extend itself, and instead saw itself dissipated by struggles on the edge.
During the decade of the 1960’s, a great social movement fought to win a place at the table for those citizens previously 
26
consigned to eating in the kitchen if indeed they ate at all.
Now that the legal and extralegal barriers have been largely removed, the battle for the remainder of the twentieth century is to close the widening gap.
None of us has much difficulty envisioning the world we want or the programs, which if adopted, would ring the new dawn in.
We want a society whose single sin is the democratic satisfaction of the needs of its people.
We want to guarantee all Americans an equal opportunity to participate in the organization of society, and in the shaping of public and private decisions which affect their lives.
We want to guarantee that no one goes without the basic necessities ‐ food, shelter, healthcare, a healthy environment, personal safety and an adequate income.
Instead, the hopes and dreams of generations that each succeeding year would be the year in which the land of the slave finally becomes the home of the free have been set aside in favor of defense spending, balanced budgets and corporate domination of the economy.
In spite of the progress made so far, the real problem remains to be solved. As Dr. W.E.B. Dubois put it, “The greater problem, which obscures the basic one, the problem of the color line, is the fact that so many civilized persons are willing to live in comfort, even when the price of this is the poverty, disease and ignorance of the majority of their fellow men.”6
What we need to be about today ‐ and for many, many years to 
27
come ‐ is a version of politics which cannot be labelled by the old terms.
If there is an opening for an American era of politics different from the past, then it must be a citizen’s democracy, insurgent, but with its focus aimed seriously at power.
When I speak here of “democratic” I do not mean the political party I belong to but rather the system of equally distributing wealth and power in an organized society, through institutions based on the premise that we all have equal ability ‐ an equal right ‐ to make decisions about our lives and our future.
This will require the creation of a large cadre with strategy, skill and vision to build a democratic movement in the mainstream ‐ a reassertion of the plain truth that ordinary women and men have the common sense and ability to control their lives, given the knowledge and the means.
For too many Americans, civil rights is a spectator sport, a kind of NBA in which all the players are Black and the spectators white.
But in this true to life game, the players are of every color and condition, the fate of all fans tied to points scored on the floor. When either team wins, the spectators win too.
When four little girls died in a Birmingham church bombing, Sally Ride won the right to shoot the moon.
Because Black students faced arrest at Southern lunch counters almost 30 years ago, the law their bodies wrote now protects older Americans from age discrimination, Jews and
28
Moslems and Christians from religious bigotry, and the disabled from exclusion because of their condition.
When the struggle for civil rights began to intensify three decades ago, we knew it would be hard fought and never cost free.
But we hoped the American people would bear the burden and pay the price. And for a while, Americans answered, ""We will.""
The 1960s movement and the ferment which preceded it grew from the willingness of ordinary people -- housewives, students, a seamstress, teachers, a railroad porter -- to seize control of their lives.
They did not wait for mythic charismatic leaders to organize a march or boycott; they organized themselves.
They did not wait for mass approval -- they faced rejection, knowing they were right.
Today, we wait for others to certify our politics, to give sanction to our protests.
It took one woman's courage to start a movement in Montgomery, the bravery of only four young men in Greensboro to set the South on fire.
Surely there are men and women -- young and old -- here today who can do the same. If there are hungry minds or hungry bodies starving near these wealthy walls, someone here can feed them.
If there are precincts of the powerless poor nearby, someone here can organize them.
If there is racial injustice on the campus or in the town, someone here can conquer it.
29
If America still spends more on guns than butter, someone here can reverse that ancient trend.
Now is the time in the third century of our republic to make the promise of the founding fathers come true -- one nation, with liberty and justice for us all.
When I entered the labor force more than 30 years ago, 5 workers paid into the Social Security system to support every retiree.
Their names were probably Carl, Ralph, Bob, Steve and Bill.
When I retire, there will only be 3 workers for every retiree — their names will probably be Kwanza, Maria, and Jose.
I want them to have the best future they possibly can.
Again, DuBois speaks to us from the past. He said, at the turn of the Twentieth Century: ""I believe in God who made of one blood all the nations that dwell on the earth. I believe that all men -- Black, brown, and white -- are brothers, varying through time and opportunity, in form and gift and feature, but differing in no essential particular, and alike in soul and in the possibility of infinite development.""
""Especially do I believe in the Negro race; in the beauty of its genius, the sweetness of its soul, and its strength in that meekness which shall inherit this turbulent earth.""
""I believe in pride of race and lineage itself; in pride of self so deep as to scorn injustice to other selves; in pride of lineage so great as to despise no man's father; in pride of race so chivalrous as neither to offer bastardy to the weak nor beg wedlock of the strong, knowing that men may be brothers in Christ
30
even though they be not brothers-in-law.""
""I believe in service -- humble, reverent service, from the blackening of boots to the whitening of souls, for work is heaven, idleness hell, and wages the 'well done' of the master who summoned all them that labor and are heavy-laden, making no distinction between the Black sweating cotton hands of Georgia, and the first families of Virginia, since all distinction not based on deed is devilish and not divine.""
""I believe in the devil and his angels, who wantonly work to narrow the opportunity of all human beings, especially if they be Black; who spit in the faces of the fallen, strike them that cannot strike again, believe the worst and work to prove it, hating the image which their maker stamped on a brother's soul.""
""I believe in the Prince of Peace. I believe that war is murder. I believe that armies and navies are at bottom the tinsel and braggadocio of oppression and wrong, and I believe that the wicked conquest of weaker and darker nations by nations white and stronger but foreshadows the death of their strength.""
""I believe in liberty for all men; the space to stretch their arms and their souls; the right to breathe and the right to vote, the freedom to choose their friends, enjoy the sunshine and ride on the railroads, uncursed by color, thinking, dreaming, working as they will in a kingdom of god and love.""
""I believe in the training of children Black even as white, the leading of little souls into the green pastures and beside the still waters, not for self or peace, but for life lit by some large vision of beauty and goodness and truth; lest we forget,
31
and the sons of the fathers, like Esau, for mere meat barter their birthright in a mighty nation.""
""Finally, I believe in patience -- patience with the weakness of the weak and the strength of the strong, the prejudice of the ignorant and the ignorance of the blind, patience with the tardy triumph of joy and the mad chastening of sorrow -- patience with God.""7

To the members of the class of 1993.
Congratulations on what you have done to bring you here today. Best wishes for what you will yet do.
I hope the optimism you must feel this day — the same optimism which led you to choose a profession grounded in the belief that there is a rational solution to every human dispute — will stay with you as you leave this institution and these ceremonies this afternoon and enter the world beyond these grounds.
Not all young people share that faith or are positive about their futures.
Some of my undergraduate students here at the university read each new day's frightful headlines and tell me things have never been as bad as they are today.
If I agree with my students that our social ills are major and we have many problems yet to solve, I also ask them to reflect on how far we have come, and how that journey was made.
I ask you to do the same.
At home and abroad, they see group pitted against group, race against race, gays, straights, men, women, black, brown and white against each other.
I look at life from a longer perspective and argue that, in many ways, things have never been better than they are today.
When I was your age I could not have sat where you sit today.
2
Then, I could not have taught at this university.
Then, I could not have stood before you here, and many of you then would not have worn the law school's robe or ever hoped to hang its diploma on your wall.
At your age, I could not have voted in parts of the United States. I could not lower my body to a lunch counter seat or lift my aspirations to public office.
The doors of most schools in this region were closed to me.
The state of Virginia, which today certifies black and white men and women as learned in the law, had laws then which prohibited black and white men and women from learning together.
One difference between then and now was a courageous cadre of lawyers, willing to risk in order to extend freedom.
Like builders who stand on one step in order to construct another, with each reaching higher than those who built before, they created a body of law that opened doors, expanded opportunity, and widened the range of human possibility.
You are leaving the university at a time of great hope and promise in our national life, when we are reaching upward once again.
Yesterday's nightmare decade, when bigotry trickled down from those on high and income was redistributed upward, is at long last, over.
There is today a sense of new possibilities, however overwhelming our national problems may appear or however grim the headlines from abroad may read.
3
And there is, despite great divisions of race, class and gender, a shared feeling among Americans about what must be done to make our nation whole.
We agree more often than not about some basic goals.
We all want to live in a society whose major goal is the democratic satisfaction of the human needs of its people.
We all want to guarantee all Americans an equal opportunity to participate in the organization of their society, and in the shaping of each public and private decision which affects their lives.
And we all want each American to enjoy the basic necessities — food, shelter, health care, a healthy environment, personal safety, and an adequate income.
As leaders of your generation, you must seize the moment and claim the realization of these goals as the proper work of your lives.
Earlier in this century, other generations of college and university educated young people delayed their pursuit of private wealth to seek the public good; they left the academy for factories where they organized workers, using their training and skills in human development and not in the accumulation of riches.
They sacrificed prestige and power to give power to ordinary people.
They helped create a national consensus that government's role was to help those who could not help themselves.
When the private economy proved unable to beat back the
4
Depression, they flocked to public service to make government create a social safety net and help put wages into people's pockets once again.
And when, three decades ago, one in every five Americans still lived in great privation, and a tenth of all our people still lived behind a wall of segregation, they volunteered to teach, to organize, to walk dusty roads to register voters, to become the people's advocates so that communities could win freedom for themselves.
Just as our country has known good times and bad, so has the profession of law. Indeed, so important is your chosen profession in our democracy, that the fortunes of the nation are reflected in those of its lawyers.
So it is that, at its worst, the law is about avarice and greed; at its best, the law is about justice and fair play. As its practitioners, you must see to it that for your generation of lawyers, the law is not about dollars, but about sense — common sense, a sense of fairness.
Charles Hamilton Houston, who taught Thurgood Marshall how to practice law, once described what a lawyer's obligations were:

to be ""the mouthpiece of the weak and a sentinel guarding against wrong,"" and
to ensure that ""the course of change is ... orderly with a minimum of human loss and suffering.""

""A lawyer,"" Houston told his students, ""is either a social engineer or he's a parasite on society.""
5
That choice is yours today.
You are about to become part of an elite group in our national community. In the recent past, from the vantage point of the people, lawyers have been objects of derision and scorn. It is your burden — and your great opportunity — to restore the law and lawyers to a position of respect and admiration.
You have done your best so far — that is why you are here today.
I urge you to continue to do and to be your best.
The late scholar Irving Howe once said: ""Fighting for social justice doesn't pay well, but it's steady work.""
That work needs you.
The law needs you.
Your country needs you, too.

Heroes, Hope and History
A few weeks ago, I spoke at Berea College in Kentucky. A week later I was in Newcastle-upon-Tyne in Great Britain, speaking at the English university where Martin Luther King Jr. received an honorary degree in 1967. Today we gather in Birmingham, Alabama where King achieved one of his most prominent victories.
Berea, Britain and Birmingham are brought together in 1993 because of the American movement for racial justice that traces its roots back to the first landing on these shores of African slaves.
Anger at the evil of the slave system produced Berea, a school established in 1855 by abolitionists John G. Fee and Cassius Marcellus Clay. Opened originally as an interracial school, after John Brown's raid, Berea aroused the anger of its white neighbors, and the school's teachers and their families were driven out. John Fee spent the Civil War years preparing to return and reopen the school. Its doors opened again in 1866 with 187 students — 96 blacks and 91 whites. It dared to provide a rare commodity in the former slave states — an education open to all — blacks, whites, women and men.1
One of the early students was my grandfather, James Bond, who graduated from Berea in 1892. He had been born a slave in Lawrenceburg, Kentucky, in 1863, four days before Abraham Lincoln first issued the Emancipation Proclamation.
2
His mother, Jane Arthur, had been given as a wedding present to a new bride, and when the bride became pregnant, her husband — my great-grandmother's owner and master — exercised his time honored right to take his wife's slave as his mistress.
That union produced two children. Under English law, status had descended from the father, but in the slaveocracy, condition derived from the mother, insuring the master's black children would not dare to presume to be his heirs.
Now that slave's grandson teaches at the university slave owner Thomas Jefferson founded in Virginia, and teaches young Americans about the modern day struggle for human liberty. That struggle has its roots in Jefferson's words more than his deeds and its parallels in James Bond's membership in a transcendent generation — that body of black women and men born in the 19th Century in servitude, freed by the Civil War, determined to make their way as free women and men.
My students are modern young men and women filled with the cynicism and despair of their age. For them, these are the worst of times, and my documentation of a harsher and more oppressive past does not always convince them that these days are better times than those older days they study with me.
Today's world holds few heroes for my students, and this lack of heroes, coupled with their pessimism, makes them unlikely candidates to create a movement of their own.
My students learn about a more modern generation of Americans than my grandfather's. The transcendent generation they study, born
3
in segregation in the 20th Century, was freed from racism's legal restraints by its members' own efforts, determined to make their way in freedom.
This modern generation shared confidence with the slave-born generation which preceded and produced them.
Speaking at John Fee's funeral in 1901, my grandfather viewed the world about him hopefully. He said:
""The false partitions set up to separate classes and races are falling down. Illogical and un-Christian distinctions, though still disgracing the age and hampering the spirit of progress must soon yield to justice and right... Then forward in the struggle for advancement.""
""Wrong for a time may seem to prevail and the good already accomplished seem to be overthrown. But forward in the struggle, inspired by the achievements of the past, sustained by a faith that knows no faltering, forward in the struggle.""2
""Forward in the struggle, inspired by the achievements of the past!""
My students come to me knowing little of the achievements of the past, believing only as do so many others, that Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. and the civil rights movement are synonymous.
Nor do my students share the optimism that grandfather James Bond expressed in 1901 or the expectations of success the civil rights movement was built upon in the middle of the 20th Century.
The historian's task is to remind them — to remind ourselves — that King was more than the movement and that the movement was
4
more than Martin Luther King. Through demonstrating the democratic nature of the movement, by aiming a microscope at the mass, we not only discover and expose heroism unknown; we demonstrate in turn the optimism and sense of possibility which was the movement's engine. By giving voice to the hopefulness of earlier generations who faced resistance and oppression my students have never known, and will never know, we make heroism more available, more attainable to a generation inclined to see through a glass darkly.
I want my students to learn history, heroes, and hope.
Preserving and interpreting the civil rights past requires acknowledgement that the movement was made by many, not the few, and the avoidance of the King-deification and dependence which has so permeated the historical discourse.
This is an appropriate time for reminiscence. Like my students, we will soon see what almost no one living now has ever seen; the birth of a new century and the death of an old one. In a country like ours which, despite of or perhaps because of its youth, is much taken with celebration and commemoration of anniversaries, 1993 is a notable year.
One hundred and thirty years ago President Abraham Lincoln signed the Emancipation Proclamation. Because my grandfather was born in Kentucky, he remained a slave until the 13th Amendment became law in 1865.
Fifty years ago the world was at war, and Roosevelt, Stalin and Churchill met in Teheran.
Back in the United States, between May and August of 1943,
5
race riots swept through American cities, resulting in 40 deaths.
This year also marks the 30th anniversary of the civil rights movement's notable March on Washington where Martin Luther King delivered his best remembered speech, in which he asked Americans to share his dream.
These anniversaries are of special benefit to historians. They provide a handy platform from which retrospectives can be launched, and a proper distance from which to look upon an event with suitable detachment.
These anniversaries regulate the separation of antiquity from the present and provide formal opportunity for rumination and self-examination, an opportunity to ask new questions or provide fresh answers to old ones.
Yet in our glorification of the past, we often bemoan the present day reality. From the present we look backward and see the modern civil rights movement as heroic, with King in the leading role. I want to discuss King as hero, first in the larger context, and specifically in his role here in Birmingham 30 years ago this year.
By regarding King and the civil rights movement as heroic, we miss the reality of each. Each becomes more — and less — than they actually were, robbing today's lesser mortals of any ability to duplicate their heroism today.
So let us first examine the notion of heroes — who they were yesterday and are today, why we require them, and how we explain them to generations who could not know them as we did. This search
6
requires the examination of hidden and obscured texts which celebrate the faceless and nameless persons who made yesterday's civil rights struggle the might movement that it was.
Carlyle wrote: ""Hero worship exists, has existed, and will forever exist, universally among mankind.""3
Closer to our own times, that wise sage Ronald Reagan told us, ""Heroes may not be braver than anyone else; they're just braver five minutes longer.""4
When the United States was being born, our heroes were its creators. As the new nation pushed further westward, our heroes were frontiersmen. When the nation was torn over slavery, our hero was the martyred president. When the re-united nation went to war, our heroes were soldiers and their generals.
These figures came to us through a popular press as eager then as now to manufacture and exaggerate. But the invention of the motion picture and its spreading popularity, the creation of a single America of instantaneous, shared experience through radio, and then television, and the creation of celluloid creatures has, I think, changed our expectations of who our heroes might be.
Perhaps the biggest change has been in how we expect our heroes to look and sound. Radio, movies and television celebrated bass-baritone voices. The high pitched voices of Eugene V. Debs and Theodore Roosevelt cause nervous laughter when they are heard today. The application of a looks and sounds test where a deeds test alone had sufficed altered who our heroes could be; heroism was expected of those who looked and sounded the part.
7
Our heroes, then, have changed as technology has changed our expectations, and that technology expanded the lists from which heroes could be chosen — today they come more frequently from weekly combat on the playing field than from the battleground.
The oral tradition that once transmitted heroic words from generation to generation has been replaced by the VCR; today we can fast-forward through a modern hero's life to get to the good parts. Once we were inspired by the telling; today we are entertained by the viewing.
Buckskin clad backwoodsmen and powder wigged Founding Fathers have been replaced by the Italian suited Wall Streeter and the head-shaved sports star. That athlete transcends racial boundaries; today, so does Martin Luther King.
This marvelous man who was my college teacher speaks in death and memory to whites and blacks as he never did in life.
In grainy film taken at his 1963 March on Washington speech, we hear again the measured, rhythmic cadence, we see the commanding presence, we hear the booming voice, we share the martyr's dream.
We honor him because of what he means to our imperfect and selective memories — the stoic who faced injury and death, and the major figure of his period, the spokesman for nonviolence, able to articulate for whites what blacks wanted and for blacks what would be required if freedom was to be the prize.
But that King is half the man. The King we see is a blurred picture of who the man was.
8
The reappraisals of King, his leadership, the movement he helped to make, and most recently his character have taken a familiar path.
Thirty years ago this year he emerged triumphant from Birmingham. He had skillfully employed youthful demonstrators whose buoyancy and vitality provoked the anticipated and nationally televised violence from the local police. He had drawn an unwilling President into his drama; the President's men helped make a settlement possible.
A few months later his dramatic speech at the March on Washington cemented his place as first among equals in America's civil rights leadership. Like the beatings and hosings in Birmingham, King's Washington speech was televised; in a nationwide mass meeting, an American audience was treated for the first time to the unedited oratory of America's principal preacher, and for the first time, a mass white audience heard the undeniable justice of black demands. By 1965 King was at the apex of black leadership; his success in Selma at soliciting national revulsion at racist violence translated into federal action and marked him as the primary figure in America in the leadership of what was being called the Negro revolution. With King as leader, the organized movement would remain peaceful, and the movement's goals would remain inclusion into the American mainstream, but other events and personalities would begin to intrude.
In December, 1964, King was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize; within a few months he demonstrated he took the Prize seriously,
9
speaking out against the War in Vietnam.
King's conscience could not avoid involving him against the war, and his anti-war activities gave him a chance to further define himself.
""I'm much more than a civil rights leader,"" he said in mid-1965, while insisting his major focus would continue to be the struggle against black oppression.
He took a campaign against discrimination and black poverty to Chicago in 1965 and 1966, but Chicago's rigid politics suffocated the movement he tried to build. He still peppered his speeches with darts against the war and spoke more forcefully against what he called America's ""vicious class system(s).""
""If our economic system is to survive,"" he told his Atlanta congregation, ""there must be a better distribution of wealth . . . We can't have a system where some people live in superfluous, inordinate wealth while others live in abject, deadening poverty.""5
In the middle of King's Chicago campaign, James Meredith was shot on his one-man march through Mississippi; King and others took up the March. In a dusty cotton field Stokeley Carmichael shouted ""Black Power,"" and the rift between King's moderation and the militancy of other movement figures became public. Black power did more than frighten whites and black moderates; it divided support for the movement and gave sanction to those who thought American blacks already had won enough.
Acceptable pluralism became unacceptable separatism when the proponents' skins were black; pride became arrogance when
10
nonviolent petitioner became militant demander.
King's last years were marked by attitudinal changes — in black America's demands and white Americans' response. In Montgomery in 1955 blacks had asked for seats at an abundant table; they could gain and no one — except the believers in white supremacy — had to lose. As the movement grew in strength and extended beyond the borders of the Old Confederacy, many whites began to believe blacks wanted the whole table for themselves.
King interrupted preparations for a Poor People's March on Washington to help striking garbage workers in Memphis; it was there he was murdered in 1968.
The violence he had fought against in life, and had exploited so brilliantly to win sympathy for civil rights in the South, exploded across America in the aftermath of his murder.
Eighteen years later, President Ronald Regan reluctantly signed the law that made King's birthdate a national holiday, and today schoolchildren across America know part of the story of Martin Luther King. His heroic status was assured.
The story schoolchildren do not know is what makes making heroes the peculiar and ironic process that it is. They do not know that in Martin Luther King's America what had been ""a culture with a racist ideology"",6 became ""a chronically racist culture""7 after Emancipation, unifying all who found themselves ""within the Caucasian chalk circle""8, offering reward and punishment based on pigmentation in King's times and today.
The movement King helped to lead destroyed the moral authority
11
undergirding that culture; that is why we honor him. We do not honor the severe critic of capitalism and its excesses. We do not honor the pacifist who preached that all wars were evil, who said a nation which chose guns over butter would starve its people and kill itself. We do not honor the man who linked apartheid in South African and South Alabama. We honor an antiseptic hero.
He could not have imagined his birthday would be a national holiday or that American schoolchildren of all races would spend the days surrounding January 15 each year declaiming his March on Washington speech, learning about Rosa Parks and the boycott in Montgomery.
And he could not have imagined that he would be considered by many to be a hero, for if he realized he was worshiped in his lifetime, he thought that worship vainglorious and misplaced. He knew his human failings.
Because his opinions remain controversial today, we selectively honor only part of the whole man; even the most vigorous opponents of civil rights can find a King quote to camouflage their racism. They often chose excerpts from the ""I Have A Dream"" speech given 30 years ago.
This is also the 30th anniversary year of ""Project C"" for 'confrontation', the plan created by the Rev. Wyatt Tee Walker to bring creative tension to Alabama's largest city. I first knew Birmingham as a student from Atlanta; it was a place where you did not linger after football games between Atlanta's Booker T. Washington High School and Birmingham's Parker High School,
12
particularly if Parker lost. I knew the city later, from the perspective of a participant in the modern civil rights movement, as ""Bombingham"" because of the frequency of its explosive attacks on blacks. It became known throughout the nation and the world in 1963 as the site of a ferocious fight between the movement's nonviolent forces and the white resistance, and it was here 30 years ago that a bloody bomb ended the lives of four young girls.
In Birmingham's streets a drama unfolded that typifies the entire civil rights movement for many: nonviolent protestors, many of them pre-school children, singing while they marched from the 16th Street Baptist Church into blasts of water fired from cannons whose power, it was said, could strip bark from trees and bricks from buildings.
It was there that Martin Luther King and his forces found the enemy they had sought, and not found, in Albany, Georgia, the year before. Albany's police chief Laurie Pritchett was proud of meeting the movement's nonviolence with nonviolence, at least while under the public's glare.
Found in Birmingham was Public Safety Director Eugene Theosophilus ""Bull"" Connor, type-cast for the role of Southern sheriff in the successful production King hoped to direct: pot bellied, belligerent, possessor of an outsized temper and a long history as a virulent white supremacist.
Connor matched the city whose politics he dominated; the city, and its state, like him, had a heritage of vicious race relations, summed up in 1960 by the New York Times' Harrison Salisbury.
13
Salisbury wrote:
""Whites and blacks still walk the same streets. But the streets, the water supply and the sewer system are about the only public facilities they share. Ball parks and taxicabs are segregated. So are libraries. A book featuring black rabbits and white rabbits was banned. A drive is on to forbid 'Negro music' on 'white' radio stations. Every channel of communication, every medium of mutual interest, every reasoned approach, every inch of middle ground has been fragmented by the emotional dynamite of racism, reinforced by the whip, the razor, the gun, the bomb, the torch, the club, the knife, the mob, the police, and many branches of the state's apparatus.""
""In Birmingham, neither blacks nor whites talk freely. A pastor carefully closes the door before he speaks. A Negro keeps an eye on the sidewalk outside his house. A lawyer talks in the language of conspiracy. Telephones are tapped, or there is fear of tapping. Mail has been intercepted and opened. Sometimes it does not reach its destination. The eavesdropper, the informer, the spy have become a fact of life.""9
Onto this scene came Dr. King and his organization, the Southern Christian Leadership Conference (SCLC). Within a few weeks he had placed Birmingham's rigid resistance to the movement's modest demands on the front pages of newspapers everywhere. The photographic evidence of the callousness of Birmingham's police and firemen, the embarrassment faced by some of Birmingham's businessmen and the pressures felt by President John F. Kennedy to
14
stop internationally shameful displays of racial discord without seeming to do so, the relentless parade of protestors — all these combined to produce a truce and agreement whose real result was less than the sacrifice of those who faced dogs and hoses might have required.
Looking backward from today at the events which happened here, we can see the Birmingham of 1963 through others' eyes. Historians and movement leaders alike have much to tell us about what was done and what it meant — to them then and to us today.
Taylor Branch and David Garrow, in their Pulitzer Prize winning studies10 of Martin Luther King, have given us moving portraits of the man and the movement he helped to make, in Birmingham and elsewhere. For Garrow, Birmingham was where ""SCLC had succeeded in bringing the civil rights struggle into the forefront of the national consciousness.""11
For some in the civil rights movement, Birmingham was observed through the parochial prisms of organizational interests, through the lens of competition with King and SCLC for national sympathy and contributions, for the loyalty of black America, and for the attention of the White House.
Birmingham's attraction for King, at least in part, was the absence here of other civil rights organizations. The National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) had been outlawed in Alabama since 1956, but the local movement was led by the Rev. Fred Shuttlesworth, a former NAACP officer, and the movement's leadership ranks were populated with men and women who
15
had started their civil rights activism in the nation's oldest civil rights organization.
These organizational conflicts are spelled out in accounts by historians and from those who faced fire hoses and police dogs in Birmingham's streets.
The Congress of Racial Equality (CORE) played only a small and largely unnoticed role in Birmingham.
In their history of CORE, August Meier and Elliot Rudwick write: ""Isaac Reynolds, a black member of Detroit CORE, had been added to the CORE staff after the Freedom Ride. He had (recently) played a small but vital role in the Birmingham demonstrations, working closely with King's lieutenant, James Bevel, in organizing the youngsters for the marches. In early May, at a critical juncture when King wavered because of pressures from the Kennedys to hold off further demonstrations, Bevel and Reynolds, ignoring King's wishes, slipped the children out of a church and marched them downtown to jail in the most brilliant maneuver of the campaign.""12
In 1963 James Forman was the Executive Director of the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee (SNCC). In his autobiography Forman scolds SCLC's staff members for their elation — ""Dorothy Cotton and Wyatt Tee Walker were jumping up and down"" he writes scornfully — at the first taste of brutality from Connor's police.
Forman gives SNCC staff members William Porter and Willie Ricks credit for helping to organize Birmingham's students, and places Porter in the leadership of a May 5th march which Birmingham
16
firemen refused to hose down.
In spite of his obvious contempt for SCLC's willingness to sacrifice Birmingham's citizens to police terror for media attention, within a few days, by Forman's own account, he had become a co-leader of the protests he despised, sharing direction with ""jumping"" Dorothy Cotton. Forman's attitude, and the feelings of many in SNCC toward SCLC — and Martin Luther King — in summed up in the title of his chapter on Birmingham. It is called: ""Betrayal in Birmingham.""13
Despite the descriptions of prize-winning historians and authors, and despite some criticism and carping from the civil rights movement's more prominent participants, there is much more to be learned about what happened in the Magic City in the Spring of 1963. The popular view of the Birmingham movement — children facing fire hoses and the leadership of Martin Luther King — obscures a larger level of participation and involvement that explains the democratic nature of the Southern struggle for human rights.
A visitor today may be surprised to learn that Birmingham is eager to exploit its civil rights past. The city is home today to a new Civil Rights Institute, opened in 1992. It is a wonderful structure, built with taxpayers' money, a remarkable fact in view of the outbreak of protests in Birmingham a mere thirty years ago. A visitor to the Institute can learn much about what took place in the surrounding streets three decades ago, particularly why the movement was called a mass movement. Here visitors have a chance to
17
learn much about heroes and heroism.
In a ledger the Institute has used as a visitors' book on and since its opening days are written the accounts of movement participants.
Those who signed were asked to record what they did — whether they marched, were arrested, or served in some capacity or capacities, many having performed more than one activity.14
In the cramped spaces of the 41 lines on the ledger's first page are found 36 names of those who marched in 1963's demonstrations, three who served as security guards, seven who said they were arrested and six who said they were jailed, two who served as committee members, two who served meals, and ten who worked to register voters. The pages which follow list much more.
The book is the basis for the Civil Rights Institute's planned oral history project. Its sign-up sheets are also the Birmingham movement's social register, a roster of who was who and who did what, a roll call of the movement's nameless and forgotten. The listings are their testimony to their contribution, their description of what they did, an inventory of the protest movement, a catalog of what it took to make Project Confrontation work.
For most of these uncelebrated authors, in a few words, in sacrifice and suffering penned in cramped shorthand, the episodes they chose to record compose their Birmingham movement.
Empress Akweke-King, now of Brooklyn wrote: ""dog attacked.""
Rev. B. W. Henderson of Avenue O reports ""house bombed on Sugar Hill."" Ruth Barefield-Pendleton of 2nd Street West ""marched
18
Selma to Montgomery."" Doris Brewster of Riverchase Parkway simply wrote ""hosed.""
Rodrick Hilson ""brought kids from Bessemer to Birmingham.""
In Arthur Lee Smith's account he ""acted as liaison between jail and headquarters (church)"".
Willie James Coleman boasts he was ""first to go to jail for park."" Sandra Johnson's brief narrative says simply ""left school.""
Glenda Bailey of Adamsville remembers ""heard blast at church from the Fountain Heights Methodist Church"".
Thirteen-year-old Virgil Ware could not sign in for himself; he was killed on the afternoon of September 15, 1963, in the angry aftermath of the dynamite blast Glenda Bailey heard. Riding on the handlebars of his brother's bicycle, he was shot by a 16-year-old white boy riding on the back of a motor scooter. Someone signing in for Virgil Ware wrote: ""Deceased, KKK killed him same day 16th Street Baptist was bombed.""
Charlotte Billups Jernigan modestly described her father, the Rev, Charles Billups as, ""Foot soldier, dedicated worker, 1927 – 1968."" Historians of the Birmingham movement will remember that while Rev. Billups was a dedicated worker, he was far more than a foot soldier; he was at least a Major General.
Flora Smith of Bessemer was ""chaplain in jail.""
Annie Mason describes herself as ""Miles College student; sat-in at 5 & 10."" Doris Matthews wrote ""Tear gas/fire hose."" Bertha Willis, like so many others, was simply ""supporter.""
Not all who made the movement were black. Melva Jimerson, now
19
of Washington, D. C., was ""part of Alabama Council on Human Relations."" Randall Jimerson, now of East Hampton, Connecticut, ""spoke out on civil rights issues with white students in Homewood.""
Many are modest. From Stafford, Vermont, William Sloane Coffin described himself simply as ""Freedom Rider.""
Will Eatman of Birmingham remembered, ""I was water down on 5th Avenue 17th Street.""
Mrs. Odessa Robinson ""marched — Selma to Montgomery.""
Johnnie M. Smith of Birmingham ""integrated churches.""
Elijah Hill Jr. of Birmingham wrote ""yes — marched."" From Alabama's capitol, Barbara Howard wrote, ""Integrated/sit-ins/movie in Montgomery.""
Theophus C. Pogue of Anniston inscribed ""Bus bombing Anniston 1961 May 14 witnessed.""
Vonelle Wilson, Grady Wilson and Jesse Wilson jointly declared ""spent 15 days in jail.""
Gloria Washington ""spent two weeks in jail, city juvenile, county fairground.""
Bernard Johnson's movement experiences are summarized in four words: ""Got hosed and dogs.""
George Moore Jr. ""got hosed in park.""
B. G. Evands writes, ""I was there bombing of church.""
Dr. John Cashin of Huntsville describes himself only as ""Chairman, NDPA.""
Some served in other ways. Mrs. Rosie L. Craig was ""usher in the mass meetings."" William Upshaw of Laurel, Maryland described
20
himself as ""musician for mass movement."" Annye H. Braxton of Demopolis was proud to state: ""First black Marengo County to run for office.""
Luther McKinstry proudly reports ""case won against U. S. Steel.""
Bernice Levert reported someone ""slam door in face at courthouse."" Rev. Clyde Johnco ""sued city for black policemen."" Martee McPherson ""worked with Justice Department at Gaston Motel."" Janet F. Horne of Cordele of Georgia, ""at 10 years of age member of SCLC sat at feet of Dr. Benjamin Mays.""
Jesse Champion Sr. ""lost job with Birmingham schools."" Jean Moore Steward of Birmingham simply ""didn't shop.""
For some, experiences outside the marches and meetings were important. Jimmie L. Terry's melancholy note reads ""Son killed in Vietnam. First black to be buried in Elwood Cemetery.""
Frank Johnson's memory is being ""jailed with Dick Gregory.""
Of 467 signers through November 16, 1992, 322 — or 69% — had marched; 103 — 22% had been arrested.
After 25 pages, each page with 41 lines, each line defining a small space, each space filled with proud self-identifications of contributions made to breaking Alabama's rigid racial walls, of days in jail, of dogs and hoses, of marches and mass meetings, and explosions heard, of offices sought and sons killed in war, of ushers and musicians and food servers, of explosions heard, Steven Norris is the first to mention the man most Americans associate with Birmingham then and now.
21
Norris writes: ""In jail with Martin Luther King.""
""In jail with Martin Luther King!""
Here Steven Norris lists what must have been for him the significant moment of his involvement in the Birmingham campaign. His fellow authors had summed up their magic moments in other ways; they are the primary actors, only occasionally the acted upon. It is they who ""march"" or ""brought kids"" or ""were first"" to go to jail or were ""water down;"" they were attacked by dogs or hosed by firemen or simply ""spoke out"" where speaking out was dangerous.
These first 25 pages — and the others which follow — filled with the self description and identification of movement makers from Birmingham and Alabama thirty years ago — provide excellent opportunity for historians to examine the Birmingham movement anew ""from the bottom up""15, or perhaps in a more felicitous phrase, from the heart of the movement's mass.
These short descriptions recorded in Birmingham seem to me to represent sources at least as rich as answers often solicited by the professional interrogator whose best efforts must include some distancing from his subject; these proud pronouncements claim responsibility for the changes which integrated Birmingham's downtown department stores in 1963 and that allowed the taxpayers of Birmingham and Jefferson County, Alabama, three decades later, to build a monument to the movement of 1963.
The writers of these testimonies are rich sources for historians and should be heroes to us all.
In their heroism, they do not stand alone. Most of those who
22
made the movement were not famous; they were faceless. They were not the noted; they were the nameless — the marchers with tired feet, the protestors beaten back, the unknown women and men who risked job and home and life.
Let no one tell us their movement did not succeed.
Ask Hartman Turnbow, a black Mississippian, who said:
""Anybody hadda told me 'fore it happened that conditions would make this much change between the white and the black in Holmes County here where I live, why I'da just said, 'You're lyin'. It won't happen.'
""I just wouldn't have believed it. I didn't dream of it. I didn't see no way. But it got to workin' just like the citizenship class teacher told us — that if we would register to vote and just stick with it. He says it's goin' be some difficulties. He told us that when we started. We was lookin' for it. He said we gon' have difficulties, gon' have troubles, folks' gon' lose their homes, folks gon' lose their lives, peoples gon' lose all their money, and just like he said, all of that happened. He didn't miss it. He hit it ka-dap on the head, and it's workin' now. It won't never go back to where it was!""16
It succeeded in spite of Turnbow's ""difficulties"", in spite of what King called the brutality of a dying order shrieking across the land.
In its successes, it has much to teach us now.
Today, from Somalia and Haiti, the United States looks back at Vietnam to discover what went wrong. We can look back at
23
yesterday's civil rights movement to discover what went right.
Yesterday's movement succeeded because victims became their own best champions. When Mrs. Rosa Parks refused to stand up, and when King stood up to preach, mass participation came to the movement for civil rights.
Today, too many of my students and too many others — young and old, black and white — believe they are impotent, unable to influence the society in which they live.
Three decades ago, a mass movement marched, picketed, protested and organized and brought state sanctioned segregation to its knees.
One movement message is that people move forward fastest when they move forward together. Another lesson is that heroes need more than a passive audience if their heroism is to flourish. That audience can provide a context for heroism, a supportive cast for heroic deeds and a mirror for its valor.
King did not march from Selma to Montgomery by himself; he did not speak to an empty field at the March on Washington. There were thousands marching with him, and before him, and thousands more who did the necessary work that preceded the triumphal march. Black Americans did not march to freedom; they worked their way to civil rights through the difficult business of organizing.
Registering voters, one by one. Organizing a community, block by block. Creating a movement in which one hundred parts made up the successful whole.
The civil rights movement provides more than a century's
24
history of aggressive self-help and voluntarism in church and civic club, assisting the needy and financing the cause of social justice, and an equally long and honorable tradition of struggle and resistance.
And it provides a lesson of hope, found as surely in Martin Luther King's famous dream as in the anonymous actions of the nameless many and in the testimonies written in the Institute's ledger here.
The teacher's task is to broaden King's spotlight so the world may see the movement for civil rights in all its glory, may see all who played a part. Our task is to communicate the hopefulness that made the movement possible, the optimism that conferred heroism on a population history does not acknowledge.
My grandfather's words, spoken at his college commencement 101 years ago, may help. He said then:
""The pessimist from his corner looks out upon the world of wickedness and sin, and blinded to all that is good or hopeful in the condition and progress of the human race, bewails the present state of affairs and predicts woeful things for the future.""
""In every cloud he beholds a destructive storm, in every flash of lightning an omen of evil and in every shadow that falls across his path a lurking foe.""
""He forgets that the clouds also bring life and hope, that the lightning purifies the atmosphere, that shadow and darkness prepare for sunshine and growth, and that hardships and adversity nerve the race, as the individual, for greater effort and grander
25
victories.""17
History, hope and heroes. ""Greater efforts and grander victories.""
That was his generation's promise a century ago, an inheritance from the generation born as slaves. That is the modern movement's promise to us now.

This memorial sits only a few blocks west of the first capitol of the Confederacy, the spot where Jefferson Davis took the oath of office to become President of the Confederate States. From Court Square to the north and west of this site the order was sent in 1861 to ""reduce"" Fort Sumter, beginning the Civil War. Ninety-four years later, on a December evening, Mrs. Rosa Parks began a historic bus ride from Court Square. East of us is the Dexter Avenue (King Memorial) Baptist Church, where a young pastor named Martin Luther King, Jr., led the movement Mrs. Parks began.
We are gathered in the cradle of the Confederacy to dedicate a monument to those who died so all might be free. As we do so, let us rededicate ourselves to freedom's fight. Let us gather, not in recrimination, but in reconciliation, remembrance, and renewed resolve.
2
Once this cradle rocked with the violence of our opponents; today it is soothed by the waters of this monument. A monument which, like the movement it honors, is majestic in its simplicity, overwhelming in its power. It bears the names of forty men, women, and children who gave their lives for freedom. It recalls their individual sacrifice. And it summons us to continue their collective cause.
Most of the freedom forty were ordinary people. Long before they died, some had already surrendered their lives to service to others; for some, service competed with job and family; for too many more, death came not because of what they did but because of who and where they were at a horrible moment that made them martyrs.
Virgil Ware was riding on the handle bars of his brother's bike when death struck. He was thirteen years old -- a threat to no one, but his skin color marked him for murder, and they cut him down.
Lieutenant Colonel Lemuel Penn meant no harm. He was driving home after performing his duty as a soldier, but his color marked him for extinction, and they cut him down.
They told Ben Chester White, who wouldn't say no to integrated schools, that he was needed to help find a lost dog, and they cut him down.
They didn't believe that service in his country's army entitled Corporal Roman Ducksworth, Jr., to a front seat on the bus, and they cut him down.
3
They were looking for three other bodies when they found Charles Eddie Moore and Henry Hezekiah Dee. Only their color qualified them for death, and they cut them down.
These names and others now join their more celebrated brothers and sisters as the roll of sacrifice is called. They gave an equal measure of devotion so that all of us might be free.
Buried with each is a bit of American apartheid, for their deaths kept the movement marching on. That is why we honor them today not in sorrow, but in celebration.
There are those gathered here today who cannot remember the period when these sacrifices began, with its small cruelties and monstrous injustices, its petty indignities and its death-dealing inequities. There are many too young to remember that from that seeming hopelessness there arose a mighty movement, simple in its tactics, overwhelming in its impact.
That movement had its beginnings in Montgomery when a people chose to walk in dignity rather than sit in segregated despair. From this city, the movement and its method spread throughout the land.
In 1955, when the mournful list of martyrs begins, the American South was an apartheid society, a world where racial differences were legitimized by law. A white Southern woman recently described it this way:
""I remember, from my early childhood, that white-robed men did sometimes ride out, and that there were lynchings from time to

4
time. In those days black people could not vote. They could not travel because no lodging place would admit them. They were restricted to only the most menial jobs. There were few restrooms marked COLORED, which were the only ones they could use. No matter how hot the day they could not drink at a public fountain unless it was one of the very few marked COLORED. They were not allowed to try on clothes in the stores. In cities, where buses were everyone's means of transportation, they had to sit at the back of the bus, and I often saw them, as they made their way down the crowded aisle to the back, sworn at if they accidentally brushed against a white person. When they went to the movies they had to use a separate entrance and sit in the balcony. No black could ever come to a white person's front door.""

""And the wonder of it,"" she writes, ""is that the goodhearted among us (and we Southern whites are a basically goodhearted people), did not see the harsh injustice and indignity in all of this. It was simply the way things were."" 1
5
In 1954, the Supreme Court ruled against segregation's legality. Soon a movement arose to challenge its morality as well.
There had been protests before against this evil system, in the courts and in the streets, but after Montgomery the protests swelled to a collective force.
College students adopted the techniques of Montgomery and began accepting jail without bail when they sat down to stand up for their rights.
They soon attacked segregated interstate travel with their bodies and segregated ballot boxes across the South as well.
Through all this period, the federal government helped only when it had to, when white lives or property were under attack.
The state and local governments worked in active concert with white terrorists, and the movement's people had few allies beyond themselves.
From its inception, it was a people's movement. The cumulative effect of individual acts of passive resistance brought about modern democracy's finest hour. By 1965, Jim Crow was legally dead.
Most of those who made the movement weren't the famous; they were the faceless. They weren't the noted; they were the nameless - - the marchers with tired feet, the protestors beaten back by billy clubs and fire hoses, the unknown women and men who risked job and home and life.
We honor all of them today.
Let no one tell us that their movement wasn't a success.
6
Ask Montgomery's maids who walked to work for over a year so they could ride in dignity if the movement was a success. Ask the sharecroppers who lived in fear if the movement was a success. Ask the mothers who couldn't take their children to a downtown toilet or a decent school if the movement was a success.
And ask Hartman Turnbow, a Black Mississippian, who said, ""Anybody hadda told me 'fore it happened that conditions would make this much change between the white and the black in Holmes County here where I live, why I'da just said, 'You're lyin'. It won't happen.' I just wouldn't have believed it. I didn't dream of it. I didn't see no way. But it got to workin' just like the citizenship class teacher told us -- that if we would register to vote and just stick with it. He says it's gon' be some difficulties. He told us that when we started. We was lookin' for it. He said we gon' have difficulties, gon' have troubles, folks gon' lose their homes, folks gon' lose their lives, peoples gon' lose all their money, and just like he said, all of that happened. He didn't miss it. He hit it ka-dap on the head, and it's workin' now. It won't never go back to where it was.""2
The movement succeeded in spite of cowards planting bombs in the night, in spite of shots fired in darkness, in spite of lynch mobs and hooded thugs, in spite, as Dr. King said, of the brutality of a dying order shrieking across the land.
In its successes, it has much to teach us today. America looks back at the Vietnam war to discover what went wrong; we can
7
look back at the movement to remember what went right.
As the old Freedom Song reminds us, ""Ain't but one thing we did wrong; stayed in segregation a day too long. Ain't but one thing we did right; that's the day we started to fight!""
Yesterday's movement succeeded — in part — because the victims became their own best champions. When Mrs. Parks refused to stand up, and when Dr. King stood up to preach, mass participation came to the movement for civil rights. We must continue to fight.
Today, too many of us — young and old, Black and white — believe we are impotent, unable to influence the society in which we live.
Three decades ago, we marched, we picketed, we protested; and we brought state sanctioned segregation crashing to its knees. We must continue to fight.
Yesterday's headlines send forth the message that we move forward fastest when we move forward together.
Today we have more experience, more legal skills, and more allies than we had then.
We have more than a century's history of aggressive self help and voluntarism in church and civic club, assisting the needy and financing the cause of social justice, and an equally long and honorable tradition of struggle and resistance.
We can double our support for those organizations which guard our liberties and protect our rights.
We can realize our full political potential, rewarding those who support equal rights and punishing those who don't.
8
We can monitor our children's schools, making sure the end of education isn't the beginning of a lifetime of unemployment.
We must continue to fight.
Next to those we honor today, we are called to give comparatively little — our time, our energy, our caring.
As Robert Kennedy once said:
""Few will have the greatness to bend history itself, but each of us can work to change a small portion of events, and in the total of these acts will be written the history of (each) generation. It is from numberless diverse acts of courage and belief that human history is shaped. Each time a man stands up for an ideal, or acts to improve the lot of others, or strikes out against injustice, he sends forth a tiny ripple of hope, and crossing each other from a million different centers of energy and daring these ripples build a current that can sweep down the mightiest walls of oppression and resistance.""3

May the waters of this monument create ripples of hope -- now and forevermore.

Let me state the case for you. A Black American should run for President in 1984 because:

(A) the race itself will increase registration and make it more likely that Ronald Reagan and Reaganism will be defeated next year;
(B) a black person must run to prove to our children that Black people can have unlimited vision and ambition in America; not to run denies our youth their future; and
(C) running a Black candidate will force the white candidates to adopt ""Black"" positions on foreign and domestic issues, giving true weight to our numbers in the electorate.

Are these reasons why? Let us begin at the beginning.

[A handwritten dash appears in the right margin next to the following paragraph.]
The single vote Frederick Douglass received at the 1888 Republican Convention in Chicago marks him as the first Black to receive such attention from a major political party, but Douglass recorded another such first as well; sixteen years earlier, in 1872, he was nominated in absentia for Vice-President by the newly-formed Equal Rights Party.
The Presidential nominee was Victoria Woodhull, a suffragist.
Douglass was chosen because of his reputation, and because he was Black. Symbolism was important, even then.
""We have the oppressed sex represented by Woodhull,"" said the man who nominated him. ""We must have the oppressed race represented by Douglass.'""
Douglass declined the nomination, Ulysses S. Grant was nominated by the Republicans, Horace Greely by the Democrats, and Grant won.
One hundred and eleven years later, no issue has divided America's Black political community as much as the question of whether -- and if so, with whom -- Blacks ought to once again contest the Presidency in next year's Democratic primaries.
Former friends have become instant enemies as they dig in and settle down on various sides of this debate.
Nominal allies have become at least temporary opponents as the benefits and dangers of running and not running are argued with at least as much heat as light.
[A handwritten dash appears in the right margin next to the following paragraph.]
Before any final conclusions are reached, it may be well to have the facts before us, to examine closely the history of past attempts to put a Black face in the White House or on a party ticket, to see whether or not the complicated arithmatic and rules of the Democratic Party's delegate selection process make such an attempt likely to return real benefits to all of Black America.
3
That last point is absolutely essential -- what is under discussion in most places today is an assault on the Democratic Party's nomination for the Presidency of the United States, and not an independent race for the White House.
Nonetheless, a June 5 Gallup Poll tells us that an independent race for President in 1984 by the Reverend Jesse Jackson against expected Republican nominee Ronald Reagan and possible Democratic nominee Walter Mondale would certainly and easily guarantee a Reagan victory.
It is important to note that Jackson who disavowed an independent candidacy, much as John Anderson did . , He then ended his race for the Republican nomination and faced Jimmy Carter and Ronald Reagan as an independent in November, 1980.
Crusades are difficult to contain; constant celebrity almost impossible to abandon voluntarily.
The Gallup figures show that an independent Jackson candidacy in the November, 1984 general election would reduce Reagan's expected share of Black votes from 10% of the total cast to 7%.
Walter Mondale's expected 80% share of Black votes would be reduced to only 29%, causing his defeat, and the Rev. Jackson would end in third place with 48% of Black votes cast.
Gallup's projections are that 41% of all voters would choose Reagan, giving him another four year lease on the Presidency and another four-year noose around Black people's necks; Mondale would finish a close second, a position important only in horseshoes, with 40% of the total vote, and Rev. Jackson would come in last place with 9% of all votes cast.1
In this scenario, Jackson's gains are Mondale's losses, and while we may properly acknowledge that polls taken in early June 1983 may have
4
little relation to events which may transpire in November of 1984, it is safe to conclude that an independent Black candidacy ought to be dismissed out of hand today, and attempts to breathe life into such a campaign next year attacked as the suicidal attempt such a race would surely be.
Any political action whose chief effect is re-electing Ronald Reagan deserves the contempt of American Black people.
Let us focus then instead on the probabilities and possibilities of a Black candidate in next year's Democratic primaries and caucuses, on his or her chances to win sizeable numbers of delegates and to influence the selection of an eventual nominee and platform by the Party.
Is anyone here talking of a Black person winning the nomination or General Election? If not, we may then proceed.
A May, 1983 poll in the Garth Analysis showed Jackson running third for the Democratic nomination, with 9% of the Democratic vote. He placed third behind Mondale, who won with 36% of the Democratic vote, and John Glenn, who placed second with 24%.
Since Blacks are as much as 20% of the total Democratic electorate, 9% of the total Democratic vote may not be encouraging. The Garth Analysis says that Jackson's candidacy would harm Mondale's chances, reducing Mondale's share of Black votes from 48 to 21%.2
The most recent poll taken before this meeting that I could discover -- released in the August 29 issue of Newsweek magazine -- confirmed the effect of a campaign by Rev. Jackson.
5
Newsweek says a Jackson campaign would reduce Reuben Askew's Black vote by one percentage point, from 3 to 2%; Alan Cranston's share of Black votes would be cut in half, from 4 to 2%; John Glenn's Black vote would be cut from 15 to 9%; Gary Hart's one percent share of Black votes would be totally erased, and Walter Mondale's commanding 47% of Black votes would be reduced to 29%, the same figure as in the June Gallup poll I cited earlier.
Only Ernest Hollins -- to whom Newsweek gives a modest 2% of Black votes -- would be unaffected by Jesse Jackson entering the Democratic primary race.3
One final poll result. The Gallup Poll and the National Opinion Research Center of Chicago have found that the numbers of Americans who say in 1983 they will consider voting for a Black candidate for President are higher now than ever before.
Seventy-seven percent in the Gallup survey and 85% in the Chicago-based poll said a Black candidate would get their consideration, if not necessarily their vote.
That is a great increase, nonetheless, over previous years. As recently as 1958, only 38% of Gallup's respondents would admit they would vote for a Black Presidential candidate nominated by their party. Fifty-three percent in 1958 would not vote for such a candidate, however, well-qualified he happened to be.
Coincidentally, this same poll showed that a Black Vice-Presidential candidate would enhance the Democratic Party's appeal to party voters; a
6
Black in the second spot on the Republican ticket, conversely, would make members of the Grand Old Party less likely to support their party's choice for President.4
Until this moment, all of the effects attributable in the least respect to the threat -- real or actual -- that a Black person may contest the Presidency have been overwhelmingly positive.
Several thousand new Black registrants have been added to the voters' roll, as quite probably will several thousands more.
Most have been registered as the results of organized efforts by the traditional organizations like the NAACP; others have taken the initiative on their own, but all are motivated, at least in part, by the rush of excitement that has permeated Black political activity recently.
The current increase in Black voting strength interestingly predates our current concerns with candidates and Presidential politics.
It surfaced first in the 1982 mid-term elections, when Black voters recorded a gain in voting rates over 1978's Congressional contests at five times the increase recorded by Hispanics and twice the rate of increase for whites. In nine states, Blacks voted at a rate higher than whites, demonstrating that candidate color may be less important in stimulating the Black electorate than had been supposed.
Increases continued in 1983, with the unprecedented registration and turnout in Harold Washington's victory in Chicago and carried forward through Wilson Goode's primary victory in Philadelphia and the challenge of the William Murphy campaign in Baltimore.
When the possibility of a Black Presidential candidate is added to those more easily attainable goals, and when the real opportunity to reverse
7
and erase four years of Reaganism presents itself next year, it is natural that interest in voting among the people who have seen the vote deliver real change would be heightened.
Indeed, if there are any lessons to be learned from the recent March on Washington for Jobs, Peace and Freedom, is it that Black America remains convinced overwhelmingly of the efficacy of politics as a means of group advancement.
Not as the only means, surely, but speaker after speaker at that gathering exhorted the audience to correct the imbalance between white and Black registration and voting rates, and to use the power of the ballot to right the wrongs done to us.
The announced Democratic candidates are surely more aware of the power of Black votes -- potential and actual -- than in past campaigns.
In the past, we were often content to vote for candidates because they knew the words to our hymns; today's crop is competing for Black votes on a slightly higher plane, offering issues and not emotions.
Five of the Democratic candidates have staked out positions on Africa and the Carribbean radically different from the Administration's views, and a general improvement over the standard Democratic perspective of the non-white world.
The most conservative of them all has made a bold statement in favor of quotas; the most liberal has made a point of mentioning that his printing and air line tickets are supplied by Black firms; each has senior Black staff serving in responsible positions, and each seems to know that an excited, energized Black electorate is essential to victory in the primaries in the Spring and absolutely vital against the Republicans in the fall.
8
The incumbent, having deliberately alienated Black voters in order to attract the sizeable portion of white supremacists in the general population, is now engaged in trying to win those voters whose skins are brown, and to avoid alienating those moderate whites who view with horror the Administration's regressive civil rights policies.
Why then shouldn't some Black person run for President again? Not simply to prove to our children that it can be done -- Frederick Douglass proved that almost 100 years ago, and Mrs. Shirley Chisholm reproved it in 1972. Others proved it before and since, giving ample testimony that a Black person can run for President, as a Democrat, a Republican, or representative of practically any party. It has already been done.
To suggest that doing it again in 1984 proves a point somehow unproven to date, negates our history, and cheapens our past struggles.
That history is worth reviewing, briefly.
It isn't surprising that the history of efforts by Blacks to be nominated by political parties large and small is so sketchy -- Black people weren't even invited to an Inaugural Ball until 1949.
If Douglass was the first Black to receive a Presidential vote at a Republican Convention, in 1888, the Rev. Channing Philips of the District of Columbia seems to be the first Black to get a vote at the Democratic nomination, 80 years later in 1968. He received 67.5 votes.
1968 was notable because two other Blacks ran for President that year as well -- Dick Gregory as candidate of the New Party, and Eldridge Cleaver as nominee of the Peace and Freedom Party.
Four years later, in 1972, former U.S. Representative Shirley Chisholm made what must be considered the best organized and best financed race to
9
date for a major party's nomination.
She won 28 delegates, and received 151.25 votes at the convention, losing to George McGovern.
Mrs. Chisholm spent almost $300,000 by her own account, and had only three paid staff members.
""I ran for the Presidency"", Mrs. Chisholm wrote later, ""despite hopeless odds, to demonstrate sheer will and refusal to accept the status quo.""5
Those are admirable sentiments, and are probably shared by Clifton DeBerry, the Black Socialist Worker's Party candidate in 1980 and 1964; by Clennon King, who carried the banner for the Independent Afro-American Party in 1960, and unknown others, less successful than these.
With such a record of past efforts behind us, some other justification must be found today to rationalize what will be a great expenditure of material and human capital, and the enormous risks taken by the person who offers as candidate.
The risks are real, for personal and character assassination are realistic chances any Presidential candidate, white or black, must assume.
When the candidate makes actual threats against the status quo, as any Black candidate must do, the risks escalate.
Are the risks, then, equal to the prize, and if the prize isn't victory, then what can it be? How can success be measured in a race in which one contestant's supporters admit he won't reach the finish line and the main effect of his running at all will be to eliminate the next most favored candidate?
The only answer must be the effect he will have on the other candidates.
10
However liberalized they may be by the threat of a Black candidacy, none of the announced candidates for the Democratic nomination are as likely to represent Black interests as candidate, nominee or President as a Black person might.
At best, they are light shades of pale compared to the deep dark strength that the concentrated power of a disciplined and unified Black electorate can bring to the Presidential nominating process next year.
Understanding that process, and the weight it gives to well-organized sectors of the electorate, is crucial to weighing the chances of a Black candidate next year.
Although the first contests of the 1984 Democratic Presidential selection process will be held on February 27, when Iowa opens its tiered system of selecting delegates in caucuses, and on March 6, when New Hampshire holds its primary, for Blacks the race begins on March 13, when primaries are held in Alabama, Florida, and Georgia.
Although other primaries and caucuses are held in other states on that day, these three states have 15 Congressional districts between them in which a Black candidate may be expected to do more than simply show up.
Three days later, Mississippi and South Carolina Democrats will caucus; these two states have 11 districts between them where a Black candidate may be reasonably expected to elect delegates.
Here is where an understanding of the rules is crucial. Each state is accorded a base delegation, 3/4ths of which is elected by districts and 1/4th at-large, and each state is given a 10% add-on, reserved for party and elected officials. All of these delegates must be pledged, must either publically declare for a candidate or announce they are uncommitted.
[Printed upside down on the bottom left of the page:] -13
11
Then each State receives another add-on of delegates, also reserved for party and elected officials. These delegates will be unpledged. Half of all delegates will be men.
As a general proposition, a Presidential candidate must receive 20% of the votes cast in a district; without that 20%, he fails to place at all. Only 86 of the United States' 435 Congressional Districts have a 20% or greater Black population.
It is clear then a Black candidate must win, and win well in those 86 districts, unless he or she can count on something neither Harold Washington or Wilson Goode could -- votes from a large minority of non-black voters.
You may know that the Joint Center for Political Studies has developed a ""best case"" scenario for a Black candidate in 1984. Their research suggests that 778 of the 3,923 delegates to the 1984 Democratic Convention in San Francisco can be Black, and that as many as 250 of those delegates could be pledged to a Black candidate.6
The Joint Center sums up the risks as well.
As we have noted, one risk is drawing votes away from a candidate who, in the absence of the Black candidate, would be the most attractive nominee to Black voters.
In that same vein, overwhelming support for a Black candidate who nonetheless does not receive enough delegate votes to block or influence the nomination, leads inevitably to the selection of a white candidate chosen with little participation from Black voters, and little reason to be responsive to their concerns.
There are other risks -- suffice it to say that this process ought not be entered upon as cavalierly as has apparently been true in the past.
12
On balance, I think the argument falls in favor of continuing the exploration -- the threat, if you will -- of what could be a momentous step forward for Black America, or another exercise in self-indulgence.
That exploration should be more sophisticated than it has been in the past. It is disconcerting, to say the least, to discover that one of the leading clerical cheerleaders for a Black candidacy is a man who was one of Richard Nixon's biggest Black supporters, and who supported Ronald Reagan in 1980.
We've heard the slogan, ""It's about time"" a great deal this year.
Let me suggest that if it isn't time to announce that John Smith or Roosevelt Robinson or Jesse Jackson or Mary Jones will run for President as a Democrat in 1984, it isn't time either to say that no one will run.
We need yet to register those voters who seem reachable only through excitement.
We need still to force more than rhetorical concessions from the white candidates, and from the national and local Democratic parties.
What will be most important as decision date approaches, is that Black voters will want to know who is running on what platform, and for what purpose, utilizing what strategy, with which goal in mind, and chosen by whom.
As we have seen, Black people have had their eyes on the White House for more than 100 years.
We have had our symbolic contests, and we have had some real ones.
Next year, we have a right to demand that white candidates respect and honor our votes.
13
From a Black candidate, if one should run, we can demand no less -- if we insist that white candidates cease taking advantage of us, we must make the same demand of Black candidates too.

Last November's rejection of eight years of Nixon and Ford showed that the electorate was ready for a change.
They were tired, they seemed to say, of callousness in the capitol, of carelessness with people's lives.
They wanted a government that could be as good as they thought they were and elected a candidate who said he wanted the best.
2
Sixteen years ago, another Democrat administration came into office promising us the best and the brightest. This year's new faces in Washington's high places seem oddly reminiscent of those in 1961, as if they had been born again just for today. The new cabinet is hardly more [illegible] racially or sexually integrated than the one it replaces, and appears to belong to at least as many private clubs.
The new government's initial composition is a surprise only in that it was expected to be different, it was expected to reflect -- in greater measure -- the composition of the victory that put it into office.
[Handdrawn line between these two paragraphs.]
91% of the Black people who voted on November 2, 1976, voted for the Carter-Mondale team. These voters provided the margin of victory and more in 13 states, states whose electoral votes gave the winning side 216 of the 270 electoral votes they needed to win.
It is now entirely reasonable for these voters to expect their loyalty to be repaid, not just in putting their faces in high places, but by developing plans to eliminate 200 years of imposed pathology from their lives.
Over ten years ago, the noted sociologist Kenneth Clark described the Black ghetto as: ""social, political, educational, and--above all--economic colonies. Their

inhabitants are subject peoples, victims of the greed, cruelty, insensitivity, guilt and fear of their masters.""
That description is sadly still true today. No election has changed it. No riots in the street have shifted it. No cries of 'freedom now' or 'Black power' have made the slightest difference in the relationship between the colony and its masters, between serf and lord, between have and have-not.
Today's tragedy is both that things remain the same, or worse, but also that many believe them to have been radically altered.
The removal of the more blatant forms of America apartheid have made it easy for too many to believe today that Black people are really equal and free.
Nothing could be further from the truth.
The old sayings are still true. We are still last hired, first fired. We are still last in, first out. We are still poor out of proportion to our numbers, powerless despite our ability to elect presidents, ignorant in spite of integrated schools, hungry regardless of integrated lunch counters.
A look at the first 76 years of this century are instructive. When the twentieth century began, Black people
4
were slaves in every way but legally. Most of us could not vote. Nearly all of us went to segregated schools, and in the South, only a few months a year. Most could not hope to become educated beyond high school, and almost none at the graduate level. Most worked as semi-skilled laborers. Few owned their own homes.
Seventy years later, much of this had changed. Most of us had escaped the farm for the city. Most of us were able to vote, even itf we chose not to do so. Most of our children went to schools that were integrated by law, if segregated by fact. We had become doctors, lawyers, teachers, office holders -- had spread ourselves across the spectrum of American employment.
Yet even this progress is deceptive. In 1971, we were ten per cent of the employed workers of America, but only 1 per cent of the engineers, only 2 per cent of the physicians, only 3 per cent of the managers and administrators, 6 per cent of the craftsmen, as contrasted with 17 per cent of the service workers, 20 per cent of the laborers, and 50 per cent of the household workers.
And we have constantly constituted twice as many of those who have had no job at all.
5
These examples describe That situation describes a people in permanent crisis, a crisis shown not just in figure and fact, but in the daily lives of millions for whom life has never been a crystal stair.
American Blacks have tried to escape this dilemma through prayer, protest and politics, and [illegible] have found that none of these alone can guarantee salvation.
In the 114 years since Abraham Lincoln freed the slaves, the fortunes of Black Americans have risen only to fall again, like opposite ends of a see-saw.
From Reconstruction until today, the lives of Americans whose skins are dark have been colored by race.
[In the right margin, a handdrawn marking with a line.]
Shortly after the beginning of this century, the late scholar W. E. B. DuBois set forth a method and goals for Black America. He said then:
""We must complain. Yes, plain blunt complaint. Ceaseless agitation, unfailing exposure of dishonesty and wrong - this is the ancient, unerring way to liberty and we must follow it....
""Next we propose to work. These are the things that Black men must try to do:

to press the matter for stopping the curtailment of our political rights;

6

to urge Negroes to vote intelligently and effectively;
to push the matter of civil rights;
to organize business cooperation;
to build school houses and increase the interest in education;
to bring Negroes and labor unions into mutual understanding;
to study Negro history;
to attack crime among us.... To do all in our power by word and deed to increase the efficiency of our race, the enjoyment of its manhood rights and the performance of its just duties.

""This is a large program. It cannot be realized in a short time.... This is the critical time.""

What was true for Dr. DuBois 72 years ago is sadly true for us today.
[In the right margin, the same handdrawn marking as the previous page.]
The first American revolution which began on the 4th of July 200 years ago was a revolt against the British economic exploitation of the merchant class of the new colony.
They threw off that yoke, and with fine words and stirring phrases, began to construct what grew to be the
7
mightiest nation in the world.
But those builders rejected the darker stone -- they used his toil and sweat to construct an international colossus which stands nearly unequaled as a power on this globe.
That first revolution automatically excluded large portions of the population from the vision of what the United States ought to be.
They excluded all women. They excluded Native Americans, whose lands were stolen, people slaughtered, rights trampled. And they excluded African Americans, a people kidnapped from their homelands, brought to this country as slaves, counted 3/5 of a [illegible] man in framing the Constitution, their families destroyed, their labor exploited, their humanity denied, their religion suppressed.
Now two hundred years have gone by, years of great struggle punctuated in half by civil war, and more recently by nonviolent movement.
While much of the nation paraded and celebrated this great anniversary, a large and growing American underclass still waited for its Declaration of Independence to be announced.
9
The struggle for radical equality has heightened over the past 60 years, years of legal struggles in the courts complimented by other struggles in the streets.
What had its origins as a movement for civil rights has now become a political and economic movement, and Black women and men are winning office and power in numbers only dreamed of before.
But despite an increase of over 150% in the number of Black people holding office, despite our ability to sit or ride or eat or vote in places that formerly lacked Black faces, in a real way we find our condition unchanged.
A quick look at every statistic that measures how well -- or how poorly -- a group of people are doing, the kinds of figures that measure infant mortality, median family income, life expectancy -- these will show rather clearly that while our general condition has improved a great deal, our relative condition has actually managed to get worse.
It is almost as if we were climbing a molasses mountain dressed in snowshoes, while everyone else rides a rather rapid ski lift to the top. Now the ski slopes are more treacherous, the molasses melting into mud, a
9
Sargasso Sea of crime in high places, of joblessness for many, and hopelessness for many more.
Yesterday's gains become suspect. The bus front seat loses meaning for a people whose longest trip is likely to be from the feudal system of the rural South to the more mechanized, high-rise poverty of the North.
The right to vote loses meaning for a people forced to choose between Tweedledum and Tweedledee.
The right to an integrated education can mean little to children bussed from one ignorant academy to another.
The classic civil rights struggles of the sixties were successfully carried forward against discrimination in housing, employment, education and government, both because the victime became their own best champions and because they found a sympathetic ear in the national body politic.
But as the demands became more strident, as a foreign war drained our treasury and young manhood, as our best and brightest were beaten down by bullets, a shift occurred in the national consciousness.
Through New Year's Eve, 1976, the decade of the nineteen seventies has been disaster again for Black people.
10
The combination of the gratituitous gratification of the gross and the greedy, the national nullification of the needs of the needy, and the victory of the politics of penuriousness, prevarication, of pious platitudes and self-righteous swinishness signaled an end to the progress made in the nineteen sixties.
The ten years that went before had seen the number of people officially defined as poor -- by government statistic -- reduced by nearly one-third. Yet despite these successes, the cruel and callous castrators in Washington moved with cold calculation to freeze and cut back urban renewal, model cities, community action, public service employment, student loans, public housing, federal impact funds for education, and to impose a sixty percent pull-back in social services.
If we were to believe with Thomas Jefferson that the common man ""is the most precious portion of the state,"" we find that precious resource in real danger of economic extinction today.
Now the pattern is being set for what the next four -- or eight -- years will bring.
[A handdrawn line in the right margin with an arrow pointing up.]
The battle must shift now toward achieving the economic democracy that so long has been denied most
11
Americans, and has relegated Black Americans to being a permanent underclass, half subsisting below the poverty line, while the rest work twice as hard to earn half as much as everyone else.
A proper program for the rest of the seventies would include:

income and wealth redistribution through a tax structure that reduces the disparity between the needy and the greedy;
the beginning of the end of poverty through a program of real full employment, supplemented by a negative income tax for workers earning on the margin;
a system of total, lifelong education that would dignify vocational as well as academic training, and permit each American to realize full potential;
free, adequate, cradle-to-grave health care for all Americans, financed through the national treasury and not by profit-making insurance companies;
effective social control of monopoly, and

12

national, regional, or municipal ownership of vital services, operated for need, and not for profit.

These promise no perfect world, but do hold out the hope that we may create a system of laws and relationships between us that promise more than the present system of privilege for only a few.
[A handdrawn line in the right margin with an arrow pointing down.]
To discuss the future at all is risky -- none of us has any sure notion of what the next few moments may bring.
We do know -- or hope, however, that life will go on, that the slow slide from bening concern to malignant neglect can now be reversed.
Racial progress has been measured out in marginal doses to date. The next few years could be the years in which the home of the slave becomes the land of the free, but only if we continue to insist -- in word and deed -- that the snail's pace becomes a race.
There can be no better prescription for relieving this crisis, and for reviving some interest in it, than by re-creating a non-partisan national coalition of need, with us as base, of parents who want care, not warehousing for their children, of workers who want work at a decent
13
and protected wage, of people who work for their living and can't live on what they make as well as those who can't find work but can't live on what we so grudgingly give, of all those people who want an end to welfare and capitalism for the poor and subsidy and socialism for the wealthy and all who must learn that sufficiency for those at the bottom is compatible with stability for those in the middle.... All those people now live in America, divided now by race and class, fearful of each other, contentious and impotent.
An entire political movement came to near maturity in America in the sixties. Fueled by the fire from the Southern civil rights and national anti-war movements, it threatened to challenge the foundations of the racial and economic arrogance that has created vast reservations of the unwanted on this country's soil.
The movement became the partial victim of its own success. It fought for and won the right to sit in front of the bus, to cast a vote, to sit at a lunch counter. It built the base of a Black political movement in the United States, but it failed to sustain and extend itself.
For too many, social concern began to be measured by the length of our hair, or the trickiness of our handshake.
14
For too many, picking up beer cans by the side of the highway became an acceptable substitute for winning jobs for Black people in the brewery.
We ought to be reminded of some words spoken by Dr. W. E. B. DuBois nearly half a century ago:
""We are American Negroes. It is beside the point to ask whether we form a real race. Biologically, we are mingled of all conceivable elements, but race is psychology, not biology, and psychologically we are a unified race with one history, one red memory, one revolt. It is not ours to argue whether we will be segregated or whether we ought to be caste. We are segregated; we are a caste. Our problem is: how far and in what way can we consciously and scientifically guide our future so as to insure our physical survival, our spiritual freedom and our social growth? Either we do this or we die. There is no alternative. If America proposed the murder of our group, its moral descent into imbecility and crime and its utter loss of manhood, self-assertion and courage, the sooner we realize this the better. By that great line of McKay, 'If we must die, let it not be like hogs.' But the alternative of not dying like hogs is not that of dying or killing like snarling dogs. It is rather conquering
15
the world by thought and brain and plan; by expression and organized cultural ideals. Therefore, let us not beat futile wings in impotent frenzy; but carefully plan and guide our segregated life, organize in industry and politics to protect it and expand. [Large handdrawn slash here.] What will be, no one knows. It may be a great physical segregation of the world along the color line; it may be an economic rebirth which insures spiritual and group integrity amid physical diversity. It may be utter annihilation by class and race and color barriers in one ultimate mankind, differentiated by talent, susceptibility and gift -- but any of these ends are matters of long centuries and not years. We live in years, swift, flying, transient years. We hold the possible future in our hands, but not by wish and will, only by thought, plan and organization."" 1

It is poor people living on a rich land. It is Atlanta and Houston and Birmingham but it is also Dawson and Santee.
The South is magnolias and mystery, peanuts and presidents, a region on the map as well as a definite state of mind.
It is romance to some and tragedy to many, but mainly it is its people, forced together by the meaness of their lives and pulled apart by a history none can ever forget.
It is a section born again new more times than it can count. Each successive new South was market by a spurt in growth. Each promised to deliver the region into conscious imitation of the more affluent Northeast, while promising not to repeat the mistakes made their in progress' name.
But repeat they did, creating a mix neither North or South, containing the worst excesses each ought to have left behind.
Our task is to take history and make future, to create the world we need. Slowly and without notice, a different set of decision makers is coming into their own.
On city councils and in state legislative halls, a newer kind of public servant is serving, often isolated and impotent, but beginning now to learn that this machine is more sluggish than we may have thought.
2
While this movement from the streets into the halls of power holds some promise, some other events about us ought give us all pause.
First, the Republicans have announced they will mount an all-out campaign to recruit Black voters, believing with some reason that many nominal Black Democrats are tired of being taken for granted by one party and ignored by the other.
Next, the National Bankers Association, the trade group representing the country's 60-plus minority banks, has issued a statement opposing the current drive for labor law reform.
The venerable National Association for the Advancement of Colored People has made common cause with the oil cartel, a dangerous sign in a movement which once called itself a revolution.
Finally, most Black voters have concluded by now they voted for a man who knew the words to our hymns but not the numbers on our paychecks.
These shifts to the right, not just among the mythical man of middle America, but among the group most interested in reform and change, suggests that progress has been countered again with the promise of individual gratification at the expense of group relief.
If our alternatives are not only different but also better ways of spending our money, dividing and conserving our resources, planning our lives, then our example must be made clear.
That is partically done by exposing the difference between what we have and what we need, and by examining the condition of the least among us.
Observers of the rhetoric of the last campaign must by now have discovered that what they heard is very different from what they've got.
3
If this is a government as good as our people, then either the people or our government - or both - are stingy, mean-spirited, and callous.
Given the choice between spending more and taxing less, Carter and company have chosen the latter, with dire consequences for those who hoped for federal assistance to solve the great human problems of our times.
Even the loud debate about the three-martini lunch has been resolved against the tax-payer, who will continue to subsidize a daily martini-and-a-half.
The Humphrey Hawkins bill has been changed from federal job guarantees to a set of paper promises to reduce unemployment to a rate which will institutionalize permanent joblessness for 11% of the Black labor force.
Life is indeed unfair in 1978 if you are poor and non-white, if you are poor and pregnant, or if you are simply poor.
Having had our expectations raised, we now discover them dashed, battered and beaten by business as usual.
We are already two years into our third century as an organized people, and discovering that this third hundred years may not be much different from the two that went before.
Those first two centuries saw great advances in human liberty and technology, but little appreciable change in the relationship between those who have and those who don't.
No where is this more clear than among those whose lives are colored by race, the 23 million Americans of African descent.
Twice as many of this group are jobless now as in 1968, ten long years ago.
4
Black Americans are roughly 11% of the American population, roughly 23 million people. 13 million of us - more than half - live in America's cities.
Our numbers have doubled since 1940. Although the Black birth rate is in decline, we still increase at a faster rate than whites. 53% of us still live in the states of the Old Confederacy, although one and a half million migrated away since 1960.
Life expectancy for us has doubles in the 20th century, although a Black boy born in 1974 will still live six years less than a white boy born that same year, and Black men somehow lost a year of expectable life in the ten years between 1960 and 1970.
Our infant and maternal death rates decline each year, but three Black women still die in childbirth for every white one.
Our median income has increased to 65% of what whites will earn, but 1/3 of all Blacks still stand under the poverty line while only one of every 10 whites stands in the same low spot.
These depressing figures are important for us all, for they reflect and record American unwillingness to pay the inconvenience costs of fulfilling the American dream.
They demonstrate why our cities are in decay, our prisons overcrowded, our welfare system at financial and moral bankruptcy, our political institutions paralyzed and impotent.
A clearly defined 10% of the whole has been condemned to the status of a permanent underclass, doomed to never stand shoulder to shoulder with their country women and men.
So far this century, the life chances of this group of Americans have improved only when everyone else steps up the ladder too - this group then has a larger stake in achieving economic democracy than the majority of those with whom they live.
5
During the decade of the 1960's, a great social movement fought to win a place at the table for those citizens previously consigned to eating in the kitchen if they ate at all.
Now that the legal and extralegal barriers have been largely removed, the battle for the remainder of the twentieth century is to close this widening gap.
None of us has much difficulty envisioning the world we want or the programs, which if adopted, would ring the new dawn in.
We want a society whose single aim is the democratic satisfaction of the needs of its people.
We want to guarantee all Americans an equal opportunity to participate in the organization of society, and in the shaping of public and private decisions which affect their lives.
We want to guarantee that no one goes without the basic necessities - food, shelter, health care, a healthy environment, personal safety and an adequate income.
Instead, the hopes and dreams of generations that each succeeding year would be the year in which the land of the slave finally becomes the home of the free have been set aside in favor of balanced budgets and corporate domination of the economy.
In spite of the progress made so far, the real problem remains to be solved, the problem Dr. W.E.B. DuBois called ""the greater problem, which obscures the basic one, the problem of the color line, is the fact that so many civilized persons are willing to live in comfort, even when the price of this is the poverty, disease and ignorance of the majority of their fellow men.""1
6
What we need to be about in 1978 - and for many, many years to come - is a version of politics which cannot be labeled by the old terms.
If there is an opening for an American era of politics different from the past, then it must be a citizen's democracy, insurgent, but with its focus aimed seriously at power.
When I speak here of ""democratic"" i do not mean the political party now in power, but rather the system of equally distributing wealth and power in an organized society, through institutions based on the premise that we all have equal ability - and equal right - to make decisions about our lives and our future.
This will require the creation of a large cadre with the strategy, skill and vision to build a democratic movement in the mainstream - a reassertion of the plain truth that ordinary women and men have the common sense and ability to control their lives, given the knowledge and the means.
The instruments involved in building such a movement are more than electoral races, as important as they may be. The lessons we ought to have learned from the sixties is this: mass movement must have an organized base; without organizations that are stable, continuous, and mass based, the movements that do emerge eventually flounder and decay; the sixties, in retrospect, were merely a series of mass mobilizations, winning some impressive victories and inspiring great expectations, but ultimately unable to sustain a living democracy at the base of the society.
We must develop a political program broad enough to attract a large section of the population, real enough to have some expectation of implementation, and human enough to solve the problems which most Americans have in some measure.

In community after community around the country, one can see such a movement began.
Its practioners are many and its focus deverse, but there seems to be a common thread throughout, the notion that small changes can become larger ones.
Those veterans of the streets in the sixties have carried some passion into city halls in the '70's, but discover almost daily that the machine they fight is ponderous, slow, and nearly immovable.
We can take heart from some words from Nobel Laureat George Wald who said:
""About two million years ago, man appeared. He has become the dominant species on the earth. All other living things, animal and plant, live by his sufferance. He is the custodian of life on earth, and in the solar system. It's a big responsibility.
""The thought that we're in competition with Russians and Chinese is all a mistake and trivial. We are one species, with a world to win. There's life all over this universe, but the only life on the solar system is on earth, and in the whole universe we are the only men.
""Our business is with life, not death. Our challenge is to give what account we can on what becomes of life in the solar system, this corner of the universe that is our home; and most of all, what becomes of men -- all men, of all nations, colors and creeds. This has become one world, a world for all men. It is only such a world that can now offer us life, and the chance to go on.""2"

While preparing my remarks for this gathering today, I thought how foolish it was for me to try to become an expert among experts. Surely the people on the far side of this podium know more about this subject than I may ever hope to know.
I thought, therefore, I would discuss the problem that stands behind this one, and indeed, behind nearly every other problem American citizens of every race and color and sex face - the central problem of the 20th Century.
Real welfare reform in America in 1978 would consist of three programs alone:

Real full employment, with emphasis on ""real"" and ""full"".
National, comprehensive, health insurance for all Americans, financed by the national treasury, and not by profit-making insurance companies.
The eradication of racism from every aspect of American life.

Over three quarters of a century ago, the late scholar W.E.B. Dubois described the problem of the 20th Century as ""the problem of the color line.""
He later amended that Description to include: ""........ the greater problem, which obscures the basic one, the problem of the color line, is the fact that so many civilized persons are willing to live in comfort, even when the price of this is the poverty, disease and ignorance of their fellow men.""

We gather here at a peculiar point in American history, governed by men who promised a government as good as its people. Their election was most made possible by the members of the perpetual American underclass, that bottom 10% of the population that is Black.
The election results read as they did in 1976 because a generation of Black Americans had sacrificed themselves on Southern altars, winning the right to vote for a people who had no guaranteed rights at all.
The exercise of the franchise by Southern Black Americans nearly erased race as a political topic in the region, re-introduced other Americans to the region and its leaders, and gave a stamp of approval to the current occupant of the Oval Office.
In large numbers in the early 1976 Presidential primaries, and in record numbers in the November general election, Black voters weighed all the candidates and found most of them wanting. Our choice became the nation's choice. We helped make legitimate a candidate whose geographical origins and previous campaigns had made suspect. Black hands were laid on, and helped to purify a candidate who had made cruel cracks about ethnic purity.
At the time, 1976 had appeared to be the year in which Black Americans finally demonstrated some political maturity. 91% of all those who voted for President in '76, voted for the Carter - Mondale team. These voters - denied the right to register a few years ago - made the difference in 13 states, states that delivered 216 of the 270 electoral votes any candidate needs to win.
These voters - for their children, and for those who will come behind them - expressed by act of faith in 1976 that the political process could make a major difference in their lives.

In the decade of the 1960's, their bodies marching in the streets had forced a reluctant government to act to remove the petty apartheid practiced throughout a quarter of the country. Their marching bodies had won the right to vote, to sit in the front of the bus, and to sit and work and learn in places that used to lack Black faces.
They sadly discover in 1978 that these rights quickly lose their luster when they lack the financial ability to make them real.
The right to sit in the front of the bus may lose meaning for a people whose longest trip is likely to be from the feudal system of the rural South to the more mechanized, high-rise poverty of the North. The right to eat at a lunch counter means little for people with champagne appetites and ripple pocketbooks. The right to an integrated education means little for children bussed from one ignorant academy to another. The right to register, the right to vote, even these most precious rights may lose meaning for a people forced to choose between tweedle dum and tweedle dee.
If this is a government as good as our people, then either the people or our government - or both - are stingy, mean-spirited, and greedy.
Given the choice between spending more and taxing less, Carter and company have chosen the latter, with dire consequences for those who hoped for federal assistance to solve the great human problems of our times.
Even the loud debate about the three-martini lunch has been resolved against the tax-payer, who will continue to subsidize a daily martini-and-a-half.

The much hearlded Humphrey Hawkins Bill has been changed from federal job guarantees to a set of paper promises to reduce unemployment to a rate which will institutionalized permanent joblessness for 11% of the black labor force.
The administration's income maintainance proposals reflect its belief that public jobs are wasteful, and that potential workers must be forced into presently non-existent jobs in the private sector.
With pay at the minimum legally allowable, with each participant dismissed at the end of each twelve months, and rehired only after a mandatory two month job search, these proposals assume that a vast army of the jobless need only look to be quickly absorbed in private employment.
But the poor live largely where there are no jobs, in the central cities long abandoned by industry lured to the suburbs by incentives and subsidies created just for them - tax holidays, publically financed roads and harbors, and development authorities paid for by the many for the enjoyment of the few.
A year ago, 80% of all ADFC and S.S.I. recipients were young, old, blind or disabled. The mythical welfare father, the sluggard and slacker of popular myth, was less than 2% of all recipients.
Fewer than 20% of all Americans on public assistance are employable.
The Carter welfare reform proposal, frightened that the one of every six welfare recipients who can work won't, is willing to condemn the other 5 to permanent poverty at a level below the penuriousness where they now barely survive.
5
These proposals now being formulated and reformulated actually do redistribute income; in a perverse reverse Robin Hoodism, they steal from the poor to give to the poorest.
Most recently we are treated with a program for urban salvation, a program whose funding level suggests saving some cities but surely not all.
Taken together, two centuries of neglect and present indifference seem to suggest a continuation of life on the margin for America's poor people, too many of whom are Black.
At the same time this population cries out for relief, some alarming signs are appearing throughout the country.
First, the Republicans have announced they will mount an all-out campaing to recruit Black voters, believing with some reason that many nominal Black Democrats are tired of being taken for granted by one party and ignored by the other.
Next, the National Bankers Association, the trade association of the country's 60-plus minority-owned banks, has issued surprising a statement opposing the current drive for labor law reform.
The venerable National Association for the Advancement of Colored People has made common cause with the oil cartel, a dangerous sign in a movement which once called itself a revolution.
A curious collection of some old, old friends - and some old, old enemies - has joined together to mount a legal challenge to the affirmative action and equal opportunity programs that have all too slowly begun to provide some compensation to the victims of a 200-year-old racially and
6
sexually motivated quota system that has guaranteed that only the male and the pale will have a monopoly on good jobs, on seats in colleges and universities, on positions of power and prestige, on all the benefits and rewards the United States promises the many and delivers only to the few.
In such a climate it is easy to see why many have concluded we voted for a man who knew the words to our hymns, but not the numbers on our paychecks.
Life is indeed unfair in 1978 if you are poor and non-white if you are poor and pregnant, or if you are simply poor.
Having had our expectations raised, we now discover them dashed, battered and beaten by business as usual.
We are already two years into our third century as an organized people, and discoverning that this third hundred years may not be much different from the two that went before.
Those first two centuries saw great advances in human liberty and technology, but little appreciable change in the relationship between those who have and those who don't.
No where is this more clear than among those whose lives are colored by race, the 23 million Americans of African Descent.
Twice as many of this group are jobless now as in 1968, ten long years ago.
100,000 Black men have lost jobs in the year since Jimmy Carter became President.
7
Nonwhite Americnas are 65% of narcotic abusers. We are 50% of the women who earn their living in other women's homes. We have always constituted twice as many of those who have had no job at all.
Black Americans are roughly 11% of the American population, roughly 23 million people. 13 million of us - more than half - live in America's cities.
Our numbers have doubled since 1940. Although the Black birth rate is in decline, we still increase at a faster rate than whites. 53% of us still live in the States of the Old Confederacy, although one and a half million migrated away since 1960.
Life expectancy for us has doubled in the 20th Century, although a Black boy born in 1974 will still live six years less than a white boy born that same year, and Black men somehow lost a year of expectable life in the ten years between 1960 and 1970.
Our infant and maternal death rates decline each year, but three Black women still die in childbirth for every white one.
Our median income has increased to 65% of what whites will earn, but 1/3 of all Blacks still stand under the poverty line while only one of every 10 whites stands in the same low spot.
What social costs can all these figures mean?
""In 1970, there was a 1.4 percent rise in unemployment, which cost our society nearly $7 billion dollars.
A one percent rise in unemployment will increase the suicide rate. It will increase the number of state mental hospitalizations for males.
8
The 1.4 percent rise in unemployment in 1970 is directly responsible for some 51,570 deaths, including 1,740 additional homicides, 1,540 suicides, and 5,520 additional state mental hospitalizations.""1
These depressing figures are important for us all for they reflect and record American unwillingness to pay the inconvenience costs of fulfilling the American dream.
They demonstrate why our cities are in decay, our prisons overcrowded, our welfare system at financial and moral bankruptcy, our political institutions paralyzed and impotent.
A clearly defined 10% of the whole has been condemned to the status of a permanent underclass, doomed to never stand shoulder to shoulder with their country women and men.
So far this century, the life chances of this group of Americans have improved only when everyone else steps up the ladder too - this group then has a larger stake in achieving economic democracy than the majority of those with whom they live.
During the decade of the 1960's, a great social movement fought to win a place at the table for those citizens previously consigned to eating in the kitchen if they ate at all.
Now that the legal and extra legal barriers have been largely removed, the battle for the remainder of the twentieth century is to close this widening economic gap.
None of us has much difficulty envisioning the world we want or the programs, which if adopted, would ring the new dawn in.
9
We want a society whose single aim is the democratic satisfaction of the needs of its people.
We want to guarantee all Americans an equal opportunity to participate in the organization of society, and in the shaping of public and private decisions which affect their lives.
We want to guarantee that no one goes without the basic necessities - food, shelter, health care, a healthy environment, personal safety and an adequate income.
Instead, the hopes and dreams of generations that each succeeding year would be the year in which the land of the slave finally becomes the home of the free have been set aside in favor of balanced budgets and corporate domination of the economy.
What we need to be about in 1978 - and for many, many years, to come - is a version of politics which cannot be labeled by the old terms.
If there is an opening for an American era of politics different from the past, then it must be a citizen's democracy, insurgent, but with its focus aimed seriously at power.
When I speak here of ""democratic"" I do not mean the political party now in power, but rather the system of equally distributing wealth and power in an organized society, through institutions bases on the premise that we all have equal ability - and equal right - to make decisions about our lives and our future.
This will require the creation of a large cadre with the strategy, skill and vision to build a democratic movement in the mainstream - a reassertion of the plain truth that ordinary women and men have the common sense and ability to control their lives, given the knowledge and the means.
10
The instruments involved in building such a movement are more than electoral races, as important as they may be. The lessons we ought to have learned from the sixties is this: mass movement must have an organized based, without organizations that are stable, continuous, and mass based, the movements that do emerge eventually flounder and decay: the sixties, in retrospect, were merely a series of mass mobilizations, winning some impressive victories and inspiring great expectations, but ultimately unable to sustain a living democracy and the base of the society.
We must develop a political program broad enough to attract a large section of the populations, real enough to have some expectation of implementation, and human enough to solve the problems which most Americans have in some measure.
In community after community around the country, one can see such a movement began.
Its practioners are many and its focus deverse, but there seems to be a common thread throughout, the notion that small changes can become larger ones.
We can take heart from some words from Nobel Laureat George Wald who said:
""About two million years ago, man appeared. He has become the dominant species on the earth. All other living things, animal and plant, live by his sufferance. He is the custodian of life on earth, and in the solar system. It's a big responsibility.
""The thought that we're in competition with Russians and Chinese is all a mistake and trivial. We are one species, with a world to win. There's life all over this universe, but the only life in the solar system is on
11
earth and in the whole universe we are the only men.
""Our business is with life, not death. Our challenge is to give what account we can on what becomes on life in the solar systems, this corner of the universe that is our home; and most of all, what becomes of men--all men, of all nations, colors and creeds. This has become one world, a world for all men. It is only such a world that can now offer us life, and the chance to go on.""2"

I’ll do that. But first I want to put those ""special problems"" in a context which I believe must be appreciated before they can be dealth with effectively.
In a preliminary report last September, the President’s Commission on Mental Health stated, ""The time has come for mental health care to become part of a broader effort to meet human needs."" That is a point many of us have been trying to get across for years with regard to Black people and other minorities.
For too long, well intentioned but not very knowledgeable experts have tried to examine the etiology of Black mental health problems with little or nor awareness of the ontology….the essence of what it is to be Black in America.
We’ve learned a lot in recent years about the interlocking relationships between elements of the physical world….the ecological unity of things. We’ve begun to require environmental impact studies before major construction projects are approved. Well, we also need human environmental impact studies of major social and economic decisions, for there also is an ecological unity in the lives of our people… especially people whose lives have been injured by years of poverty and discrimination.
You cannot grapple with the mental health problems of Blacks until you-and our society-come to grips with that over-arching element of the Black experience, which is racism, its central role in the formation
2
of our country, the writing of its Constitution, its industrial growth, its political process, its foreign and domestic policies, its entire past and its probable future.
Just this weekend the Rand Corporation released a study which demonstrates that despite impressive gains, it will take 30 years before wage rates for Black American males equal those for whites.
That suggests a malignancy among us, a mental illness rooted deep in the American psyche, a cancer no surgeon can excise. It is the central fact of life for non-white Americans, eclipsing sex, geography, education - everything.
The Bryant Commission cites racism as one of the basic roots of American culture and, quote, ""Part of the etiology of much of the mental illness seen in America’s Black population."" As some of you may recall, that same finding was made more forcefully by the Black caucus of this association, almost ten years ago. A lot has changed in the course of that decade, but for many Black Americans it has been a change for the worse.
For the last century and a quarter, Black people in this country have been making the long exodus from slavery…first from slavery itself, later from its Jim Crow adaptations the American version of apartheid. But now that the formal, legal trappings of racism are nearly abolished, a growing number of Black Americans find themselves simply left out. We now can sit in the front of the bus, but too often can’t afford the ride. We can eat in any restaurant, but too many can’t pay the bill. We have traded a debased place in this society for no place at all.
3
The Bryant Commission finds that minorities, and Blacks especially, comprise a growing percentage of the mentally ill. That should not be surprising, for it matches an overall trend in the Black situation. Our position in the labor force has worsened steadily. Twice as many Black Americans are jobless now than in 1968, and in ust the year since Jimmy Carter became president, 100,000 Black men have lost jobs. We make up 10% of the labor force, but 20% of the total unemployed. Black unemployment has ranged from 12 to 14%, while white unemployment is just over 5%. The Black rate rises faster and falls more slowly than the white rate.
Illustrating that is the fact that Blacks, and other minorities, make up 27% of those who have been out of work at least 15 weeks, 30% of those who have been out of work at least 27 weeks, and 34% of those unemployed a year or longer. And we account for fully 30% of those who have gotten so discouraged they have just quit looking and dropped out of the employment statistics. That last figure has gone up steadily since 1972, when it was only 24%.
In this century, and especially since the start of World War Two, millions of southern Blacks migrated to America’s great urban centers. It was a time when the cities offered jobs and hope to the unskilled. More than half of us live in central cities today. But no sooner did we arrive than the jobs began to depart. What were starting points for the Irish, Jews, Poles, Germans, and Italians, have become urban traps for Black Americans.
These immigrants were caught in the downward spiral of change, racism and poverty. Jobs, whites, and taxes all moved to the suburbs, where racism and their own poverty prevented Blacks from following.
4
And as American society became more technologically complex and demanded more sophisticated skills for survival, urban educational systems began to decay.
For many urban Blacks, as for their neighborhoods, deterioration has been progressive and its rate exponential. Racism has enforced poverty and poverty has insured failure. One of the grim effects of poverty, of course, is under nourished youngsters. We now know that malnutrition… and even just poor nutrition…can seriously stunt the growth of the brain and impair cognitive development during the first year or two of live.
I'm told that Recent studies indicate such impairment may be reversible…up to a point. The cut-off point for reversibility, however, is likely to be early adolescence, or before. And, in any case, the evidence is pretty clear that many poor children suffer at least temporary cognitive impairment during the early, formative years of their educational experience.
The symptoms are familiar ones in our urban schools; restlessness, and inability to concentrate, heightened emotionality, irritability and a tendency to temper tantrums and even mayhem. And these effects are intensified by a ravaged physical enviornment and the pathological effects of life lived on the margin.
Educational failure is epidemic in our urban ghettoes. While Blacks have made some strides in educational and occupational attainment, only 46% manage to complete high school, as against 67% for urban whites. And many who do graduate are merely processed through, emerging nearly illiterate.
5
That is a large part of the reason Black youths face such awesome difficulty in getting a start in this society… A difficulty evidenced by a staggering unemployment rate among Black teenagers of nearly 40%. The rate for white youth is less than 15%.
Nearly a third of Black Americans live below the poverty line. The figure for whites is less than 10%. And due in large part to a welfare system that penalizes poor families which stay together, the proportion of Black families headed by a woman rose from 28% in 1970 to 35% in 1975. The increase for whites during that period was from 9 to 11%.
Dr. Harvey Brenner, of John Hopkins, has described that he calls a ""doom factor"" operating as a result of high unemployment and few prospects for improvement. And Dr. Bruce Danato, of the Detroit Suicide Prevention Center, has noted a feeling of helplessness and futility and unworthiness in people, ""because the idea of being worthy is tied to the idea of having a job and money."" A rural doctor in Tennessee, a few years ago, said that fully 50% of his patients suffered from depression due to economic and environmental poverty…. from the feeling: ""There’s no way I can get out of this.""
Others have noted that exposure to the big city sickness: Poverty, congested and polluted living conditions, tend to make some city dwellers less humane toward themselves and others…. and that self-destructive or suicidal impulses are generated by the attitude of ""What have I got to lose?""

Life expectancy has doubled for Blacks during this century, but it still is 6 years shorter than that for whites. Moreover, Black males somehow have lost a year of expectable life since 1960. One report to the Bryant Commission suggests that higher rates of Black suicides, homicides, drug abuse and imprisonment may account for the loss.
The problem I am trying to suggest was outlined recently by Representative Louis Stokes, of Ohio. Stokes is sponsoring a Minority Mental Health bill in the House, and last month he told the members that psychiatrists examining Blacks ""rarely have considered social, economic and environmental factors as primary contributors"" of Black mental health problems. He said traditional methods have neglected the fact that Blacks undergo tremendous stress as an element of routine existence, and that inner city concentration, slums, high unemployment rates, police brutality, underemployment, poverty level wages, menial employment, and broken families are all factors wich produce minority mental illness.
Now, there is a global phenomenon taking place which is sharply relevant to all this. I’m referring to the shrinking of natural resources relative to population. It has begun to reverse the economic and political dynamics which produced the industrial democracies… the Keynesian economics of perpetual growth.
We have entered, we are told, the age of scarcity. The effects already are being felt in this country. The energy crisis and rising inflation are but two examples. Another is that millions of Black Americans who have been standing in line, these many years, to get their piece of the American pie, now are being told, when they approach,
7
the counter, that the pie is already divided and all gone.
Richard Barnett, in a disturbing essay last month in the New York Times Sunday Magazine, discussed this new ""Age of Scarcity,"" and the growth of what has been called the lifeboat ethic . . . a metaphor that suggests humanity as the passengers on a kind of global Titanic, a sinking ship without enough lifeboats for everyone.
Naturally, those to be left out of the lifeboats constitute that increasing portion of the world’s population that is becoming irrelevant to the productive process…the chronically unemployed, predominantly people of color.
Barnett believes this is the heart of the global human rights problem. That, in an age of slowing growth brought on by shrinking resources, the cost of those resources is going up and the value placed on human life is going down.
The lifeboat ethic, and its consequences, are becoming increasingly visible in the United States: in the decay of the Center Cities, where most of the poor are concentrated: In the depressed rural areas no longer needed to produce the nation’s food: In the seven million Americans unemployed.
And it is visible in the striking similarities between Jimmy Carter’s budget proposals and those of Gerald Ford and Richard Nixon. All three have tended to write off the desperate needs of poor people in the name of a new brand of economic realism. Carter’s response to the plight of the cities is an urban plan that amounts to a band-aid for an ampu-
8
tation. The Humphrey Hawkins full employment bill has been so severely disembowelled by the White House that its passage into law will amount to little more than a legislative funeral. . .the remembrance of good intentions.
The code words and slogans are: ""austerity,"" ""conservation,"" ""limits to growth,"" and ""limits to what government can do."" Whatever validity they may have. they signal to minority groups that there is no more room in the boat for us.
There are other signals and shifts in mood and attitude that express the lifeboat ethic even more ominously. Samuel Huntington, and advisor to the National Security Council, warns against the ""excesses"" of democracy, and suggests that the problems of government are too complex to accommodate the conflicts inherent in democratic rule.
Interest in repairing the ravages of racism and deprivation has faded away as Americans increasingly look out for number one. And the growing volume of complaints about the cost of welfare, Medicaid, Social Security and other social programs, voices the fear that too many swimmers are hanging on to the sides of the boat, pulling it under with them.
That is the social and economic perspective of too many minority members today, and it should come as no surprise that the incidence of mental illness among them is growing. For them, life is an attenuated desperation. They are treading water, waiting for exhaustion. Dissapated by the sharks of ghetto life.
Last Sunday’s New York Times put forward the interesting proposition that more doctors may not mean a healthier population; indeed, if each
9
new physician creates between $150,000 and $350,000 in health care spending annually, we could be healthier and save money too if we could sharply limit the number of M.D.’s. Perhaps then one solution to the country’s mental health problem might be to curtail the number of mental health practioners; the fewer of you there are, the fewer the number of people who will see you, and the fewer, therefore who will be counted as needing your help.
That kind of Alice In Wonderland solution unfortunately won’t do.
Health problems - physical and mental - are epidemic in America’s minority community. The ordeal of daily life for Black Americans renders this population chronically susceptible to contagion, and chronically unable to seek a cure.
Mental health care professionals have been severely handicapped in trying to treat the psychological casualties of the American ordeal, because they have not appreciated the ordeal, and because their profession has been, in its own sphere, part of the problems.
Minorities still are pitifully underrepresented, especially in psychiatry. Fewer than 2% of America’s psychiatrists today are Black. The proportion is about the same among psychologists. I’m told there is no reliable racial count for psychiatric nurses, but only 7% of all employed registered nurses is Black. We do account for more than 11% of the social workers. But that is the only catagory matching the Black share of the population, or of the labor force.
The result is that, to many Blacks, psychiatry is just another
10
thing that white people do. Six years ago, Dr. Alvin Poussaint described the traditional Black experience with psychiatry, saying that ""usually, the only time a Black man saw a psychiatrist was when the police took him down to the hospital and a psychiatrist signed a paper saying they had to lock him up.""
Things have improved somewhat, but not radically. The face behind the desk is invariably white, and so is the prescription. Few white mental health care workers have been, or can be, trained by education to understnad Black culture and Black problems, and few Black people have been equipped by experience to trust white professionals. Most members of minority groups carry a heavy load of suspicion to any dealings with white institutions or authorities. It is a well earned suspicion, though the white professional frequently assumes ti to be evidence of irrational paranoia.
Mental health care professionals tend to relate best to young, verbal, attractive and successful patients. Those criteria, of course, exclude many poor Blacks. Some studies have shown that, as a result, Blacks tend to be underdiagnosed or overdiagnosed. Both extremes lead to the same result: Blacks tend, more than whites, to be treated with medication rather than individual or group therapy. At clinics, they tend to be shunted off to para-professionals instead of being seen by psychiatrists or psychologists.
And Blacks are institutionalized at more than twice the rate for whites. That fact alone should make it clear that something is very wrong with the delivery of mental health services to Black people.
11
The problem, of course, dictates the remedy. And the foremost remedy here must be Black mental health care workers in numbers at least proportionate to the numbers of Black people in this society. America must produce more Black pshchiatrists and psychologists.
But here, again, we run into the lifeboat ethic -- the growing resistance to remedial measures, such as the affirmative action programs--those programs to reverse the crippling effects of racism and poverty, and to compensate for the economic, psychological and educational deprivations which have prevented Black people from entering the medical profession except in token numbers.
It was relatively easy for much of white America to agree to Black demands for a seat at the lunch counter, but agreement to demands for an equal place in the factory or the office has come a lot harder. And the demand for a compensatory place in medical school has started a national backlash.
The need is clear.
It was not until 1968 - ten short years ago - that the numbers of minorities - Blacks, Native Americans, Mexican Americans, mainland Pureto Ricans - accepted into M.D. programs climbed past 200 a year. In all the years of medical education in the United States, never before had 200 students of color been admitted at any one time into American medical schools.
The slow realization spread from 1968 that is would take more than regular admissions policies to redress the imbalance caused by the 200 year-old racially and sexually motivated quota system that has guaranteed to this day that only the male and the pale will enjoy a
12
permanent monopoly on good jobs, on seats in colleges and universities, on all the benefits and rewards the United States promises the many and delivers only the few.
The problem is real. Black pwople are 13% of the national population but only 2.6% of the doctors. There are over five million Mexican Americans in America - only 250 of them are doctors. There are nearly a million Native Americans - only 72 are doctors. While there is one white physician for every 538 white people in America, for Blacks the ratio is one to every 13,888, to bring these figures into line with what they ought to be, the country would have to produce 29,000 additional Black doctors immediately. These are comforting statistics only if you believe that white people are sicker than Black people are.
The issue, dramatized by the case of Alan Bakke, has divided many old friends and allies in the civil rights movement, for some see in it an ethical contradiction. Bakke charged that the speical admissions program at the University of California’s Davis Campus amounted to a quota system, and that he had been the victim of reverse descrimination. But to admit Alan Bakke now to the first year class in medicine at the University of California at Davis would:

overturn the unanimous conclusion of 13 admissions committees at 13 medical schools which rejected him;
declare him the winner of a retroactive lottery among more than 22,000 unsuccessful applicants;
hold suspect the degrees of whites granted admission at Davis despite scores lower than Bakke’s.

13

and certify the admission to medical school of whites with low paper qualifications while denying such entry to similarly situated minorities.

But the furor created by this case, and the agonizing reappraisals it caused, revealed a philosophical and semantic trap in which many liberals found themselves caught. The trap is the concept of color-blindness.
You know, it’s curious. In days of yore, when Jim Crow still was king, color-blindness was gospel for reformers and anathema to racists. But when legal equality arrived, and economic justice also seemed to be in the offing, the racists adapted. They suddenly embraced color-blindness and used it as a shield of philosophical and constitutional respectability behind which they could hide. The reformers, however, were less adapative, or more consistent, depending on how you look at it. The result was a strange new coalition which today poses a serious threat to the hopes of minorities.
Given the bitterly unequal situations os white and non-white Americans, the idea of color-blindness is pernicious fraud. It denies reality, and sets a trap for many well-intentioned people. It is sprung by code words like ""quota"" and ""reverse discrimination.""
The former is an old associate of minority life in America; the latter, a fiction of the fearful minds of the beneficiaries of quotas that kept our best out while letting their worst in.
Reverse discrimination would exist if minorities were to brutilize, dehumanize and degrade white people, were to cause white people to take the worst jobs, to live in the least attractive sections of town, to send their children to the worst schools, and to face death at an
14
earlier age than Black people do.
What Bakke’s supporters call reverse discrimination is actually not a new notion in American education or American law.
Veterans in Georgia are given preferential treatment when they seek employment with the state. Georgia residents are given preferential treatment when they apply to our state’s medical school, even though non-residents may have better paper qualifications. In undergraduate education, such qualifications are athletic ability and genetics - that is, direct lineal descent from an alumni - are used to discriminate against some and in favor of others.
The real issue here is not the right of Alan Bakke, or any one else, white or Black, to a seat in medical school or to a medical degree. The issue is society’s pressing need for more Black psychiatrist, more Black psychologists, more Black general practitioners.
Additionally, the issue is the American unwillingness to pay the social costs of fulfilling the American dream, to insist that each of us has an equal chance at life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.
American history is the history of dreams deferred, the creation of a permanent underclass, too many of whom are Black.
No non-white American can escape the terrifying kalidescope he sees each day - a national policy devoted to keeping him always on the margin, educationally, economically, politically and mentally unwell.
The surprise is not that so many of us need your ministrations; the wonder is that all of us don’t, and quite probably, all of us victims and all of you in the victors role could equally profit from your skills.
15
You know, there is a myth of homogeniety in America that is applies even across racial and ethnic lines, where it is least supportable. It has caused a lot of trouble in the day of missed signals and misunderstandings, and it is an expecially important feature in any discussion of minorities and white staffed and oriented mental health care.
We use the same basic language. But, because our experiences and cultural foundations are so different, our assumption that we are communicating what we want to communicate and understanding what the other person is saying, often are woefully in error.
It reminds of something that once happened to Adlai Stevenson. He had given a speech to some group or other, and afterward a woman came up to him, gushing, ""Mr. Stevenson, your remarks today were just absolutely superfluous!"" Well, Governor Stevenson rose ot the occasion, and with a twinkle in his eye, he replied: ""In that case, Madam, perhaps I should have them published posthumously."" ""Oh, yes,"" she said. ""And soon, I hope.""
It was one of the few times in his live that Adlai Stevenson was left speechless. What more could he say? What more can I say. Thank you.

The Center also studied cross-sectional samples of the national white population in the fall of 1964, 1968, and 1970. The results of these studies was published in a monograph, White Attitudes toward Black People, issued in 1971.
It's author, Angus Campbell, discovered that there is no unified, ""white"" view of race relations in America, no single typical, representative, racial attitude.
Instead, white Americans generally agreed that laws ought to prohibit discrimination on the job, that urban disorder required more than a swift, police response, and that the white community should never take the law in its hands to enforce order in times of racial disturbance.
Only on the question of housing integration did Campbell find division among his white respondents.
The scholar's conclusions were that white Americans had largely abandoned their previously held contention — taught from pulpit and classroom and accepted as Holy Writ by most of white America — that Vlacks were inherently incapable of competing equally with whites. Instead, that discarded master race notion has been replaced with the assumption that low achievement levels in Black education and employment are due to a failure of will in Black America, and unwillingness to run

the race other, now successful Americans have run and won.
Campbell summed up the American racial picture today with the following truths:

White Americans are all racist in some degree;
resistance to change by the majority is the standard pattern in American race relations, although integration of the work situation is less likely to be resisted than integration of more private and personal areas of life;
social characteristics in the white population not associated with reatgional or ethnic divisions — age, sex, income, occupation — have little relationship to racial attitudes.Only college eudacation as a variable, according to Campbell, has any relationship to benign or malignant racial attittudes among whites.
white explanations for Black conditions have changed from ""the generic to motivational"", a retreat from white superiority and a gradual movement toward blaming Black America for failing to measure up to standards set for it by the majority.

The other more public statement on American race relations was issued by what was called the Kerner Commission. On July 27, 1967, this presidentially appointed commission declared that ""white racism"" was responsible for America's continuing dilemma, and that the country has headed toward two separate societies, one Black, one white.

I dwell at length at these summaries of white opinion and attitudes because they limit every discussion of the possibilities of racial progress. Like ants in an invisible bottle, Black Americans are held back by glass walls they cannot see, but feel as strongly as if they were made of steel.

In 1935, W.E.B DuBois described the situation we face today. He said then:
""The colored people of America are coming to face the fact quite calmly that most white Americans do not like them, and are planning neihther for their survival, nor for their definaite future if it involves free, self-assertive manhood. This does ntoot mean all Americans. A saving few are worried about the Negro problem; a still larger group are not ill-disposed, but they fear prevailing public opinion. The great mass of Americans are, however, merely representatives of average humanity. They muddle along with their own affairs and scarcely can be exepected to take seriously the affairs of strangers or people whom they partly fear and partly despise. For many years it was the theory of most Negro leaders that this attitude was the insensibility of ignorance and inexperience, that white America did not know or realize the continuing plight of the Negro. Accordingly, for the last two decades, we have stiriven by book and periodical, by speech and appeal, by various dramatic methods of agitation, to put the essential facts before the American people. Today there can be no doubt that most Americans know the facts; and yet they remain for the most part indifferent and un-moved.""*

After solid progress in every area of concern through much of the 1960's, one wonders how we have reverted to the racial status quo of today.
There are two reasons why we have slipped backward, two complimentary forces that have grown stronger over the last 10 years. They are conservative politics and the economy of scarcity.
Two years ago we celbrated the end of the first two hundred years of the American experiment with Democracy, and the beginning of four years of great promise.
The rejection that year of eight years of Nixon and Ford seemed to suggest that the American electorate was ready for radical change.
They were tired, they seemed to be saying, of callousness in the capitol, of carelessness with people's lives. They wanted a government as good as they thought they were, and elected as President a candidate who said he wanted the best.
About ten years ago, the noted sociologist Kenneth Clark tried to describe the ghetto where most Black people lived then as now. He said: ""...The ghetto is a social, political, educational, and -—above all economic colony. Their inhabitants are a subject people, victims of the greed, cruelty, insensitivity and fear of their masters.
The Nixon-Ford years reinforced that definition; the Carter year-and-a-half has done little to change it.
Today's tragedy is not just that things remain the same, or worse, but that the removal, over the decade of the 1960's of the more blatant forms of American apartheid, have made it too easy for too many to be-
5
lieve them to have been radically altered for the better.
Nothing, in fact, could be further from the truth. All the old sayings are still true. We are still last hired, first fired. We are still last in, first out. We are still poor all of of proportion to our numbers, powerless despite our ability to elect Presidents, hungry regardless of integrated lunch counters, and ignorant in spite of integrated schools.
A quick look at the first seventy-eight years of the twentieth century is instructive. When the 20th century began, Black people were slaves in every way but legally. Most of us could not vote. Nearly everyone who was educated at all, attended segregated schools, and in the South, for only a few months each year. Most could not hope to gain education beyond high school. Most worked as farmers or semi-skilled laborers. Few owned the land they farmed, or even their homes.
By 1970, much of this had changed, and changed for the better. Most of us had escaped the farm for the city. Most of us are now able to vote, even if we choose not to do so. Most of our children now go to schools that are integrated by law, if segregated by fact. We have become doctors, lawyers, teachers, office holders—have spread across the entire spectrum of American employment.
Yet, even this progress is deceptive. In 1971, we were ten per cent of the employed workers of America, but only one per cent of the engineers, only two percent of the physicians, only three percent of the managers and administrators, and only six percent of the craftsmen. In contrast, we were seventeen percent of the service workers, twenty percent of the laborers, and fifty percent of the women who earn their living in other women's homes. And, we have consistently constituted
6
twice as many of those who have had no job at all.
These statistics describe a people in permanent crisis, a crisis shown not just in figure and fact, but in the daily lives of millions, for whom life has never been a crystal stair.
In the one hundred and fifteen years since Abraham Lincoln freed the slaves, the lives of Black Americans continue to be colored by race. Since Reconstruction, our fortunes have risen, only to fall again, much like opposite ends of a sew-saw.
Just this weekend The Rand corporation recently released a study which demonstrates that despite impressive gains, it will take 30 years before wage rates for Black American males equal those for whites. That suggests a malignancy in the nation, a cancer no surgeon can excise. It is the central fact of life for non-white Americans, eclipsing sex, geography, education — everything.
For the last century and a quarter, Black Americans have repeated the immigrants progress undergone earlier by Europeans. Just as in 1921 it was believed that Italians, Poles and Jews were feeble minded, and therefore subject to restrictive immigration laws, Black Americans were thought mentally suspect too. An inferior people may be treated sub-humanly at worse, and differently, at best, and Black Americans have always been treated both ways.
Now that the formal trappings of racism are eliminated, a growing number of Americans of color discover themselves left out. They may sit on the front of the bus but have no where to go. They may eat in any restaurant, but can't afford the meal.
7
Twice as many Black Americans are jobless now as in 1968, ten years ago. 100,000 Black men have lost jobs in the short period of the Carter Presidency. We are 10% of the labor force, and 20% of the unemployed.
We are 27% of those who have been jobless for 15 weeks, 30% of those jobless for 27 weeks, and 34% of those who have had no job for a year.
Since the beginning of World War II, millions of Southern Blacks migrated to America's great cities. More than half of us live in central cities today , attracted originally by the promise of jobs and freedom from the reign of Jim Crow.
Shortly after we arrived, however, the jobs departed, lured to suburbs by tax incentives and subsidies; in effect a real unemployment tax paid by — not to — the urban Black.
As these cities become home for the wealthy of one race and the poverty-stricken of another, the phenomenon Dr. Harvey Brenner calls the ""doom factor"" comes to bear.
In Brenner's scheme, an increase in unemployment also increases suicide rates, homocide rates, and incidences of state mental hospitalizations among males.
A rise of 1.4 percentage points in unemployment in 1971, Brenner says, was directly responsible for 51,570 deaths, including 1,740 homicides and 1,540 suicides, and 5,520 additional state mental hospitalizations.
These depressing figures reflect and record the American unwillingness to pay the inconvenience costs of fulfilling the American dream.
They demonstrate why outr cities are in decay, our prisons overcrowded, our schools failing, and why more than 10% of our national population has been condemned to the status of a permanent underclass, doomed never to stand equal with their country women and men.

One must wonder, however, how things could bet better and worse at the same time, how a committment to total war on poverty could become a mere skirmish, and how the national mood which seemed to favor equality through most the '60s could become so perverted and mean.
The social planners of the Johnson era could not have forseen that the Vietnam war would force them to choose between guns and butter, or that guns would win and butter become scarce. They could not have predicted that their cut-backs in social service would be seized upon a decade later as proof that the poverty war was unwinnable, and that ""throwing money after problems"" was no solution at all, although the little money thrown was scattered so widely it is a wonder it had any effect at all.
They could not have predicted the global phenomenon now upon us, the shrinking of natural resources relative to the world's population, the reversal of the economic and political dynamics of the world's political democracies, the beginning of the age of scarcity.

Richard Barnett, in a disturbing essay last month in the New York Times sunday magazine, discussed this new ""age of Scarcity,"" and the growth of what has been called the lifeboat ethic... a metaphor that suggests humanity as the passengers on a kind of global titanic, a sinking ship without enough lifeboats for everyone.
Naturally, those to be left out of the lifeboats constitute that increasing portion of the world's population that is becoming irrelevant to the productive process... the chronically unemployed, predominantly people of color.
Barnett believes this is the heart of the global human rights problem. That, in an age of slowing growth brought on by shrinking resources, the cost of those resources is going up and the value placed on human life is going down.
The lifeboat ethic, and its consequences, are becoming increasingly visible in the United States: In the decay of the Center Cities, where most of the poor are concentrated: In the depressed rural areas no longer needed to produce the nation's food: In the seven million Americans unemployed.
And it is visible in the striking similarities between Jimmy Carter's budget proposals and those of Gerald Ford and Richard Nixon. All three have tended to write off the desperate needs of poor people in the name of a new brand of economic realism. Carter's response to the plight of the cities is an urban plan that amounts to a band-aid for an ampu-
10
tation. The Humphrey Hawkins full employment bill has been so severely disembowelled by the white house that its passage into law will amount to little more than a legislative funeral...the rememberance of good intentions.
The code words and slogans are: ""austerity,"" ""conservation,"" ""limits to growth,"" and ""limits to what government can do."" Whatever validity they may have. they signal to minority groups that there is no more room in the boat for us.
There are other signals and shifts in mood and attitude that express the lifeboat ethic even more ominously. Samuel Huntington, and advisor to the national security council, warns against the ""excesses"" of democracy, and suggests that the problems of government are too complex to accomodate the conflicts inherent in democratic rule.
Interest in repairing the ravages of racism and deprivation has faded away as Americans increasingly look out for number one. and the growing volume of complaints about the cost of welfare, medicaid, social security and other social programs, voices the fear that too many swimmers are hanging on to the sides of the boat, pulling it under with them.
11
At the same time, Many of the gains won on yesterday now seem suspect. The right to sit in the bus front seat loses meaning for a people whose longest trip is apt to be from the feudal system of the rural South to the mechanized, high-rise poverty of the North. The right to vote loses meaning for people forced to choose between Tweedledum ad Tweedledee. The right to an integrated education means little to children bussed from one ignorant academy to another.
The civil rights struggles of the 1960s were carried forward against rigid discrimination in housing, employment, education, and were successful because the victims soon became their own best champions and because they found a sympathetic ear in the national body politic. But, when the demands of the 1960s became more insistent, as a foreign war began to drain our treasury and young manhood, as our best and brightest were beaten down by bullets, a shift began to occur in the national consciousness.
That decade of the 1960s had seen the number of people
12
officially defined as poor, by government statistic, reduced by nearly one-third. But, beginning in 1968, the American poor became the unwilling victim of the illicit combination of the gratuitous gratification of the gross and the greedy, the naitonal nullification of the needs of the needy, and the victory of the politics of penuriousness, prevarication, of pious platitudes and self-righteous swinishness.
Swiftly, the Nixon administration, those cruel and callous castrators, moved with cold calculation to freeze, kill, and cut back urban renewal, model cities, community action, public service employment, student loans, public housing, federal impact funds for education—and to impose a 60% national pull-back in social services.
If we are to believe with Thomas Jefferson that ""the common man is the most precious portion of the state,"" we find that precious resource in real danger of economic extinction today.
Until January 1976, the federal government offered nothing
13
but a series of national disasters for Black people—with no emergency relief in sight. Now the pattern is being set for what the next years may bring.
Even now, another blow against progress is being has been successfully organized by the collection of some old friends, and some old enemies, who have joined to mount a legal challenge to the affirmative action and equal opportunity programs that all-too-slowly and cautiously are providing compensation for the victims of a 200 years of a sexually and racially motivated quota system which has guaranteed that only the male and the pale will hold a monopoly on good jobs, on college and university seats, on positions of power in government, and all the benefits and rewards American promises the many and delivers only to the few.
To admit Admitting Alan Bakke to medical school by order of the court would:

places a chilling burden on every equal opportunity plan in America, no matter how different from the one he objects to;
declares him the winner of retroactive lottery among more than 22,000 unsuccessful medical school applicants;
overturns the unanimous conclusions of 13 admissions committees at 13 medical schools which rejected him;
holds suspect the degrees of whites granted admission at the school he sued, despite lower scores than his;
and certifyies the admission to medical schools of whites with low paper qualifications while denying such entry to similarly qualified minorities."

The choice will be between the unproved promises of one candidate fallible man and the past performance of another.
If the polls by Gallup and Harris are to be believed, then the outcome as of today is not really in doubt.
One candidate, riding the crest of a wave of regional pride and the blind desire for victory at any costs, already commands the allegiance of the larger percentage of those who plan [Handwritten slash.] / to participate on the election day. But larger and larger numbers of Americans have apparently decided that the process gives them no choice, or that neither candidate promises to deliver the kinds of racial changes which must occur if the bicentennial rhetoric of thousands of speeches is to come tru.
For these Americans co constitute the uncounted and the uncommitted, the silent majority of American adults who have either withdrawn or beenc from the political process or have had it withheld from them.
Four years ago, a bare majority of the American adults who were able helped choose between Richard Nixon and George McGovern, and while those who refused to choose helped condemned those of us who did choose to choose to four more years of crime in the suites and official lawlessness.
And yet the dilemna persists. Political democracy, as practiced in the United States, guarantees the voters a series of declining choices . the traditional lesser For many of us, that choice is one we have difficulty making, and our subtraction from the political equation gives the final choice to people we believe to be less sensitive than we are. For Black American voters, the larger electoral contests seldom give clear-cut choices between absolute good and absolute evil.
And yet our participation in the political process is an absolute necessity if we are ever to be able to call ourselves free.
Over the past years, we have witnessed the ascendancy of a massive
2
coalition of the comfortable, the callous and the smug, who've closed their hea hearts, their minds and their ranks to the callaims and calls to conscience out forward by the forgotten and unpre unrepresented elements in society. This gang of legal and moral outlaws have conspired to erase the minimal gains won in the '60s at the cost of life and limb, and threatens now to tip the balance of the delicate see-saw make us members of a permanent underclass of the neglected, forgotten, living on the margin.
While there has been was a demonstrated rise in life chances for American Blacks at the end of the decade of the '60s, more recently we have behaved like a people on a see-saw, going up in one direction and down in another.
A quick look at all the statistics that measure how well - or how poorly a group of people are doing the kinds of figures that measure infant mortality, median income, life ex- will demonstrate rather clearly that group of people are doing - the kinds of figures that measure infant mortality, median family income, life [Handwritten slash.] / expectancy - will reveal that while our general condition has increased a great deal, our relative condition has actually worsened. It is almost as though we are climbing a mollasses mountain dressed in snowshoes, while everyone else rides a rather leasurly ski life to the top. Now the ski slopes are more treacherous, the molasses melting into mud, a sargasso sea of crime in high places, of joblessness for many and hopelessness for more.
Now yYesterday's gains have become seem suspect now. The bus front seat loses meaning for a people whose longest trip is likely to be from the feudal system of the rural South to the more mechanzied, high-rise poverty of the North.
The right to vote loses meaning for a people forced to chose between Tweedledum and Tweedledee. Th
The right to an integrated education can mean little to children bussed from one ignorant academy to another.
The classic struggles of the '60s were carried forward against discrimination in housing, employment, education and government, and won victories both because the victims became their own best champions, and because they found a sympathetic ear in the national body politic.
But as the demands became more strident, as a foreign ear drained our treasury and young manhood, as our best and brightest were beaten down by bullets, a shift began to occur in the national conscience. 
3
We've passed by our 200th birthday as an organized people, many of us afraid of what the future may bring, afraid to look too critically at our past, afraid to assign guilt and responsibility for our common condition. 200 years have passed since the first american revolution, an a revolution whose promises remain unfilled today. From its very beginnings, it automatically excluded great partions of the American population. It excluded all women; it excluded native americans, and it excluded african americans, a people kidnapped from their homelands, bought to this country as slaves, their families destroyed, their labor exploited, their religion suppressed. Now 200 years have gone by, years of great struggle, punctuated in half by civil war and more recently by a massive nonviolent movement.
Now as most of America basks in the reflected glow of those two hundred years, a large and growing American underclass still waits for its declaration of independence to be declared.
In recent years, the struggle of Black people has been largely a political one, as yesterday's dreams of our economic integration into the American system faded away.
In the political world, we have made great advances, but when compared with where we were when American prepared to celebrate its centennial, they seem less impressive.

[Typeset changes.]
There were thirty Blacks in the Mississippi legislature in 1870; today there are only four; there were 26 Blacks in the Georgia House in that period; today there are only 20; thirteen Blacks in the South Carolina legislature today is a great improvement over none in 1969, but during Reconstruction, we held 84 seats in the legislature there, not to mention the position of Lieutenant Governor, Secretary of State, State Treasurer, Associate Justice of the Supreme Court, and off and on, eight members of Congress. In a way, we are only struggling now to catch up with our political past. In short, Blacks in public office represent less than one percent of the more than 500,00 elected officials in the United States.
The demographic profile of Black Americans demonstrates where we are and where our political power can come from--from big cities and the non-urban South. Our profile also hints at our power-less-ness--the social indices most affiliated with Black people--low income, poor education, un- and under-employment--make for low levels of political participation.
What is so frightening to consider--in March the fading months of 1976--is that once again the nation is choosing a President, and we are less prepared than ever to participate in that choice.
5
The facts are real ones. While Black people in the Southern region have an admirable record of political performance, nationally we are in real danger of counting ourselves out of helping choose who will govern us over the next four years.
In 1960, in a close election between John F. Kennedy and Richard Nixon, 39 million eligible Americans chose not to choose.
In 1968, the figure rose to 47 million, and in 1972, 63 million Americans stayed at home and let the rest of us choose between Richard Nixon and George McGovern.
More frightening for us in 1972 is this--fewer than only one-half of the 14 million Blacks who could have voted in that election were even registered to vote.
For many of us, it is a point of pride to recall that no Black person--except the security guard who discovered the break-in--was involved at all in the entire scandal that grew to be called the Watergate affair.
For some of us, this was an indication that the Nixon administration was so racist that they didn't even want to
6
grant us equality in crime; for myself, I sadly know too many brothers who would have cut John Dean's throat if they could have taken his place at Nixon's right hand.
The point here is that Black Americans had it in our power years earlier to have prevented the entire scandal, to have erased this sorry episode from history.
In 1968, had we voted an additional 10 more Black voters per Black precinct across the United States:

Richard Nixon would not have been elected President of the United States;
Berger, Blackmon, Powell and Rhenguist would not now be on the United States Supreme Court;
Spiro Agnew might still be the Governor of Maryland;
John Mitchell would never have been Attorney General;
John Dean and Charles Colson would be practicing law in obscurity;
the world would never know--or care-- who Martha Mitchell is was,
and Gerald Ford would not now be President of the United States.

Without attempting to shoulder all of the blame for the last eight years of reactionary rule, we must share some of
7
the reponsibility, for in spite of restrictive law and social custom, in spite of shifts to the right among other sectors of the old Roosevelt coalition we belonged to, it is an undeniable fact--Black non-voters opened wide the door for the Nixon years in 1968, as surely as if we had carried him into office on our backs. It feels like we did.
Four years later, with less chance for success, our behavior was the same, and worse.
Now, despite a generally good record among Southern Blacks, the Voter Education Project estimates that a 12 to 15% point gap exists between Black and white voter registration in the eleven Southern states.
Nationally, the picture is worse. Proportionately, there are now more Black people registered to vote in Selma, Alabama, than there are in Brooklyn, or Chicao, or Detroit, or Philadelphia.
In 1976, regardless of which the candidates ultimately who come before us in November, the patterns of the poor participation in the past are likely to be repeated.
It provides little profit to discuss today why this is true if the discussion is limited to criticisms of the choices we may have then.
8
The point is that having little to do with the selection of the runners-up, we will be in poor position to blame the winners.
Critiques of the American political and economic system exist in great abundance, and need not be repeated here; to debate whether or not we ought to be in the ""system"" is like telling a drowning man he shouldn't be in the water; he is and so are we. We had better learn how to swim or build boats, and the water is rising every day.
The debate about whether or not we ought to participate in the bicentennial celebration is an artificial one; this country wouldn't have made the first 200 years without our toil and talent, and it cannot continue for another 200 days if it ignores the resource we have to offer.
We do the country-- and importantly ourselves-- a great disservice when we voluntarily stand back from the great decisions being made around us. 
[The page is cut here, at three-quarter length.]
[The first paragraph on the new page is typed on a slip of paper and stapled to the main page.] The expectation that our preferred choice may win, or will have any more effect than the power to defeat the next best candidate is slim, primarily because we have yet to build a national confederation of interest among ourselves that can be put into alliance with others who share our concerns.
What we need to be about in 1976-- and for many, many years to come-- is a version of politics which cannot be labeled by any of the old terms. To call our aspirations part of the ""new"" politics, or to label it ""radical"" or ""socialist"" is to merely put a title on a phenomenon still undergoing birth.
If there is an opening for an American era of politics different from the past, then it must be citizen's democracy, insurgent, but with its focus seriously aimed at power.
When I speak here of ""democratic"" and democracy"", I do not mean the political party presently out of power, or the system of selecting government leaders as presently practiced in America; I mean the system of equally distributing wealth and power in an organized society, through institutions based on the premise that we all have equal ability-- and equal right-- to make decisions about our lives and our future.
This will require the creation of a large cadre with the strategy, skill and vision to build a democratic movement in
11
the mainstream-- a reassertion of the plain truth that ordinary men and women have the common sense and ability to control their lives, given the knowledge and the means.
The instruments involved in building such a movement are more than electoral races, as important as they can be. The lesson we ought to have learned from the sixties is this--mass movement must have an organizational base; without organizations that are stable, continuous, and mass based, the movements that do emerge eventually flounder and decay; the sixties--in retrospect--were merely a series of mass mobilizations, winning impressive victories and inspiring great expectations, but ultimately unable to sustain a living democracy at the base of the society.
We must develop a political program broad enough to attract a large section of the population, real enough to have some expectation of implementation, and human enough to solve the problems which we have in abundance but which most Americans have in some measure.
As a beginning, let us agree on what we want:

to guarantee all Americans an equal opportunity to participate in the organization of this society, and in the shaping of public and private decisions which
12
	affect their lives;
to guarantee that none of us goes without the basic necessities--food, shelter, health care, a healthy environment, personal safety, and an adequate income;
to insure adequate national security against real threats from abroad, and
to meet our obligations to assist in the development of the world's lesser developed nations.
To meet these goals, we must move radically away from an economy where the top 1% of the population receives more income than the bottom 20% and the richest 10% of the population receives the same income as the bottom 50%.

That is a monumental task-- its conclusion, after two hundred years of struggle, is far from just around the corner. 
Let us reflect then on some words from the past, the great scholar W. E. B. DuBois:
""We are American Negroes. It is beside the point to ask whether we form a real race. Biologically we are mingled of all conceivable elements, but race is psychology, not biology, and psychologically we are a unified race with one history, one red memory, one revolt. It is not ours to argue whether we will be segregated or whether we ought to be a caste. We
13
are segregated; we are a caste. Our problem is: how far and in what way can we consciously and scientifically guide our future so as to insure our physical survival, our spiritual freedom and our social growth? Either we do this or we die. There is no alternative. If America proposed the murder of our group, its moral descent into imbecility and crime and its utter loss of manhood, self-assertion and courage, the sooner we realize this the better. By that great line of McKay, 'If we must die, let it not be like hogs.' But the alternative of not dying like hogs is not that of dying or killing like snarling dogs. It is rather conquering the world by thought and brain and plan; by expression and organized cultural ideals. Therefore, let us not beat futile wings in impotent frenzy; but carefully plan and guide our segregated life, organize in industry and politics to protect it and expand it. What will be, no one knows. It may be a great physical segregation of the world along the color line; it may be an economic rebirth which insures spiritual and group integrity and physical diversity. It may be utter annihilation of class and race and color barriers in one ultimate mankind, differentiated by talent, susceptibility and gift--but any of these ends are matters of long centuries and not years. We
14
live in years, swift, flying, transient years. We hold the possible future in our hands, but not by wish and will, only by thought, plan and organization.""*

The loudest sound to be heard in Atlanta as last night's long count came to a climax was not the cheers and happy tears of the victory celebration held to herald the success of the region's first native son to succeed in national politics in 100 years: it was rather the quiet click of thousands of suitcase locks as final packing for the great exodus for Washington begins.
Never have so many placed their faith--and risked their political fortunes--on a chance so obscure. Never before in my memory has a candidate for the White House so captured the attention and loyalty of so many in so fervent a fashion.
We have just completed the quadrennial occasion in which Americans express their preferences about what kind of
2
world they want to live in.
It has been a rather long time coming. For Jimmy Carter and his early supporters, it was the climax of more than two years of planning and work.
For those veterans of these contests of 1972 and 1968, it was a chance at power again, the creation of four years of breathing space in which to plot and plan the future.
For the loser, it is the end of a career that had already gone further than it should.
For the country, it was a chance to turn loose a government which had been warm toward special interests and tight with a helping hand toward those who needed it.
For the winner, it was the beginning of a chance to prove that faith was not misplaced, that hope could be born again, and that charity would begin at home.
What yesterday's election finally means is a subject to be debated for many, many months to come.
For some, it signifies a new South, a disappearance of yesterday's politics of race in this region, and the return of the Confederate states back into the union.
For others, the election will have no regional significance at all, but will serve only as a classic example
3
of an outsider's achievement against entrenched and established power.
For others, this will mark the first American election in which Black voters ""qualified"" a candidate, made it all right for suspicious voters to cast their votes for a white Southerner. For some, it simply means that the electorate had had too much crime in the suites, too much unemployment and inflation, too much of an administration that governed by veto, and that the Democrats' turn had come round again.
For whatever reason or combination of reasons, one man has triumphed and another lost. In the process, new political fortunes have been made.
That the choices we were offered this year did not appear to be universally popular or inspiring is not surprising. Yesterday's scandals have reinforced an old American suspicion of political figures. The contradictory rhetoric one heard from the candidates added to the inescapable conclusion that in order to be all things to everyone they were willing at times to be nothing at all. The federal election law guaranteed a monopoly and public subsidies for only two political parties, and a complicated series of state election laws insured that lesser candidates and smaller parties
4
would never really have a chance to place their option before the public.
In the end, for most voters, the choice was between the accidental president, slow minded and tongue-twisted, elevated to office only because two other men committed crimes which threw them out, and the arrogant, self-assured Georgian, riding a crest of regional pride and the outsider's image past all comers to his party's nomination.
The election held on yesterday was clearly several things to different people, but apparently for a number of Americans who chose not to choose, it was only a choice between the unproved promises of one fallible man and the poor past performance of another--nothing else, no single issue of massive importance, no single concern for ending any particular problem seemed to intrude on the public consciousness.
It was a dramatic election up to election day. The opposing candidates went from a 33 point spread in July, to 18 points in August, to an unpredictable margin too close to call on election eve.
The entire political year, beginning in New Hampshire's chill in January, has been an unusual one.
5
1976 was the year in which American voters in both major parties had more to say about who would win than ever before. Despite the real retreats the Democrat party made from its strong stand in favor of minorities in 1972, both parties offered a greater chance for the candidates to meet the voters, to be questioned and tested by them, and to submit their platforms, promises and past performance to the public jury.
What occurred then, was a record high number of primaries in which a large number of candidates offered themselves to a record small number of voters. Pluralities replaced majorities, and candidates won with margins that might have guaranteed oblivion in years before.
The American political process guarantees only a series of declining options--the primary season narrowed them down as the song goes, to a precious few.
The pre-election surveys showed the electorate in an unusual state of flux.
The reasons why a candidate slides from sure victory on Labor day to possible defeat the day before the election will be left for others to decide and debate--the lack of issues, or our lack of any perception of them, the candidates'
6
character or lack of it--all these will become chapters in the civics textbooks of tomorrow.
For many Americans, Tuesday's choice was unimportant, and any real differences between the candidates imperceptible. For Black Americans, the issue was a simple one--whether we would progress, run in place, or continue sliding backward as we have been doing since 1968.
The next President of the United States, we hoped, would name progressive new members of the United States Supreme Court, set humane policies and priorities for the various departments and agencies of our federal government which help decide what kinds of lives we all shall live.
He would, we hoped, bring a commitment to social and economic justice that could reverse our slow slide down into the depths from which we had begun to pull ourselves, at great cost and sacrifice, during the tumultuous decade of the 1960s. In foreign affairs, it was hoped he would preside over the speedy dismantling of the totalitarian regimes in Zimbabwe and throughout southern Africa, and would never again involve our armies in refereeing domestic quarrels on foreign soil.
7
He would, we hoped, restore the social welfare apparatus of the Johnson years, which saw one-third of the American poor lift themselves from poverty, and would begin to set right 200 years of wrongs done to us.
He would be empathetic to our problems, if not sympathetic toward them, and at the very least, would provide relief from the slow nightmare the last eight years have been.
Whether these dreams will now come true remains to be seen. One potential tragedy of any election year, and our participation in it, is that our standards have never been as strict as those applied by the Board of Deacons of the Plains Baptist Church--unlike them, we take candidates on faith, and do not inquire into their motives. Faith may move mountains, but it apparently won't its not guaranteed to get you into the church.
Black Americans have yet to learn the value of extracting hard promises for our votes, the traditional and time-honored means by which a group advances itself. This condition exists because we are essentially negative voters, casting our ballots against real evil and seldom in favor of an actual good. Whether that perception is real or not is a tale to be told in the years ahead.
8
A more proper subject for immediate consideration is the development of a year-round machinery in all the towns and cities where we live to insure that never again will we register and vote in such small numbers, or cast our votes with so little apparent knowledge of primises extracted, and pledges made, if any.
That in turn leads to another continuing problem in the Black political community. We have got to discover some way to institutionalize the registration process among us, so that it does not depend on panic and last minute appeals to turn itself out. Participation in the political process ought not be eleventh hour behavior stirred up by rallies and excitement, but ought to become firmly entrenched in our lives 364 days a year.
Additionally, there is an obvious need for increased political education in our community, to insure that our voters have an objective source of dependable information about candidates and issues.
Those of us who hold public office must admit some failures in this regard, but independent institutions must begin to do their part as well. The church, our press, our schools--all these must begin to see political participation
9
as part of their daily agenda as well.
Finally, we must begin now to plan and organize ourselves in such a way as to meet the expected challenges of the future. Whatever problems the next four years may hold, I believe that we must be prepared to present our alternatives as solutions to them, instead of reacting to proposals put forth by others as we so often do.
It is easy to argue in 1976 that despite our success in qualifying a president for acceptance by other voters, we remain essentially a powerless people, unable to exercise power in its truest definition--the ability to make others say yes when they want to say no. Until we have mastered that skill, then we are just whistling Dixie, a tune written and orchestrated by others.
That remains the single great challenge for Black people, regardless of the outcome of the contest held on yesterday, to construct a series of political machines, democratic with a small ""d"", powerful enough to enforce our will on an unwilling nation.
The problems which we face have slipped from whatever priority they may have held a decade ago. Like changes in fashion, the national consciousness that once created the national mood
10
which insisted on minimal equal treatment for Black Americans has receded into distant memory.
Until we are able to help shape our own destiny, and not allow it to be shaped and moulded by others, then we remain at the mercy of other interests, and our fortunes will rise and fall at their every whim.
The bicentennial year is now nearly over. Throughout its length so far, we heard speech after speech reminding us of the promises made by our Founding Fathers, promises yet unkept 200 years later.
If a new chronological era began on the Fourth of July, then we have a right to expect that a new political era will begin on January 21st. Let us pray it promises more than the last 200 years have given us. If not, we have only ourselves to blame.
The result of yesterday's election is to sweep from power the coalition of the comfortable, the callous and the smug which ran Washington--and shaped our lives--over the last eight years. The new ruling class which replaces it remains a mystery, as does the character and the nature of those who will compose it.
11
One thing is certain: the struggle which we began shortly after the first African came to these shores is far from over.
No election will ever guarantee that.
Let us reflect then on some words from the past, the great scholar W. E. B. DuBois:
""We are American Negroes. It is beside the point to ask whether we form a real race. Biologically we are mingled of all conceivable elements, but race is psychology, not biology, and psychologically we are a unified race with one history, one red memory, one revolt. It is not ours to argue whether we will be segregated or whether we ought to be a caste. We are segregated: we are a caste. Our problem is: how far and in what way can we consciously and scientifically guide our future so as to insure our physical survival, our spiritual freedom and our social growth.
12
[Typeset changes.]
Either we do this or we die. There is no alternative. If America proposed the murder of our group, its moral descent into imbecility and crime and its utter loss of manhood, self-assertion and courage, the sooner we realize this the better. By that great line of McKay, 'If we must die, let it not be like hogs.' But the alternative of not dying like hogs is not that of dying or killing like snarling dogs. It is rather conquering the world by thought and brain and plan; by expression and organized cultural ideas. Therefore, let us not beat futile wings in impotent frenzy; but carefully plan and guide our segregated life, organize in industry and politics to protect it and expand it. What will be, no one knows. It may be a great physical segregation of the world along the color line; it may be an economic rebirth which insures spiritual and group integrity and physical diversity. It may be utter annihilation of class and race and color barriers in our ultimate mankind, differentiated by talent, susceptibility and gift--but any of these ends are matters of long centuries and not years. We live in years, swift, flying, transient years. We hold the possible future in our hands, but not by wish and will, only by thought, plan and organization.""*

The loudest sound to be heard in Atlanta as last night's long count came to a climax was not the cheers and happy tears of the victory celebration held to herald the success of the fir region's first native son to suceed in national politics in 100 years; it was rather the quiet click of thousands of suitcase locks as final packing for the great exodus for washington begains.
Never who have so many placed their faith — and roisked their political fortunes — on a chance so obscure. Never before in memory has a candidate for the White House so captured the attention and loyalty of so many in so fervent a fashion.

We have just completed the quadrennial occasion in which Americans express their preferences about what kind of world they want to live in.
Despite all predictions to the contrary, the turnout was a respectible one, and the result not unexpected.

The pre-election surveys showed the electorate in an unusual state of flux.

Last November's rejection of eight years of Nixon and Ford showed that the electorate was ready for a change.
They were tired, they seemed to say, of callousness in the Capitol, of carelessness with people's lives.
They wanted a government that could be as good as they thought they were and elected a candidate who said he wanted the best.
2
Sixteen years ago, another Democrat administration came into office promising us the best and the brightest. This year's new faces in Washington's high places seem oddly reminiscent of those in 1961, as if they had been born again just for today. The new cabinet is hardly more radically or sexually integrated than the one it replaces, and appears to belong to at least as many private clubs.
The new government's initial composition is a surprise only in that it was expected to be different, it was expected to reflect--in greater measure--the composition of the victory that put it into office.
91% of the Black people who voted on November 2, 1976, voted for the Carter-Mondale team. These voters provided the margin of victory and more in 13 states, states whose electoral votes gave the winning side 216 of the 270 electoral votes they needed to win.
It is now entirely reasonable for these voters to expect their loyalty be repaid, not just in putting their faces in high places, but by developing plans to eliminate 200 years of imposed pathology from their lives.
Over ten years ago, the noted sociologist Kenneth Clark described the Black ghetto as: ""Social, political, educational, and--above all--economic colonies. Their
3
inhabitants are subject peoples, victims of the greed, cruelty, insensitivity, guilt and fear of their masters.""
That description is sadly still true today. No election has changed it. No riots in the street have shifted it. No cries of 'Freedom Now' or 'Black Power' have made the slightest difference in the relationship between the colony and its masters, between serf and lord, between have and have-not.
Today's tragedy is both that things remain the same, or worse, but also that many believe them to be have been radically altered.
The removal of the more blatant forms of American apartheid have made it easy for too many to believe today that Black people are really equal and free.
Nothing could be further from the truth.
The old sayings are still true. We are still last hired, first fired. We are still last in, first out. We are still poor out of proportion to our numbers, powerless despite our ability to elect presidents, ignorant in spite of integrated schools, hungry regardless of integrated lunch counters.
A look at the first 76 years of this century are instructive. When the twentieth century began, Black people
4
were slaves in every way but legally. Most of us could not vote. Nearly all of us went to segregated schools, and in the South, only a few months a year. Most could not hope to become educated beyond high school, and almost none at the graduate level. Most worked as semi-skilled laborers. Few owned their own homes.
Seventy years later, much of this had changed. Most of us had escaped the farm for the city. Most of us were able to vote, even it we chose not to do so. Most of our children went to schools that were integrated by law, if segregated by fact. We had become doctors, lawyers, teachers, office holders--had spread ourselves across the spectrum of American employment.
Yet even this progress is deceptive. In 1971, we were ten per cent of the employed workers of America, but only 1 per cent of the engineers, only 2 per cent of the physicians, only 3 per cent of the managers and administrators, 6 per cent of the craftsmen, as contrasted with 17 per cent of the service workers, 20 per cent of the laborers, and 50 per cent of the household workers.
And we have constantly constituted twice as many of those who have had no job at all.
5
These examples describe a people in permanent crisis, a crisis shown not just in figure and fact, but in the daily lives of millions for whom life has never been a crystal stair.
American Blacks have tried to escape this dilemma through prayer, protest and politics, and has found that none of these alone can guarantee salvation.
In the 114 years since Abraham Lincoln freed the slaves, the fortunes of Black Americans have risen only to fall again, like opposite ends of a see-saw.
From Reconstruction until today, the lives of Americans whose skins are dark have been colored by race.
Shortly after the beginning of this century, the late scholar W. E. B. DuBois set forth a method and goals for Black America. He said then:
""We must complain. Yes, plain blunt complaint. Ceaseless agitation, unfailing exposure of dishonesty and wrong — this is the ancient unerring way to liberty and we must follow it.….
""Next we propose to work. These are the things that Black men must try to do:

to press the matter for stopping the curltailment of our political rights;
6

to urge Negroes to vote intelligently and effectively;
to push the matter of civil rights;
to organize business cooperation;
to build school houses and increase the interest in education;
to bring Negroes and labor unions into mutual understanding;
to study Negro history;
to attack crime among us.….to do all in our power by word and deed to increase the efficiency of our race, the enjoyment of its manhood rights and the performance of its just duties.

""This is a large program. It cannot be realized in a short time.….this is the critical time.""

What was true for Dr. DuBois 72 years ago is sadly true for us today.
The first American Revolution which began on the 4th of July 200 years ago was a revolt against the British economic exploitation of the merchant class of the new colony.
They threw off that yoke, and with fine words and stirring phrases, began to construct what grew to be the
7
mightiest nation in the world.
But those builders rejected the darker stone--they used his toil and sweat to construct an international colossus which stands nearly unequaled as a power on this globe.
That first revolution automatically excluded large portions of the population from the vision of what the United States ought to be.
They excluded all women. They excluded Native Americans, whose lands were stolen, people slaughtered, rights trampled. And they excluded African Americans, a people kidnapped from their homelands, brought to this country as slaves, counted 3/5 of a white man in framing the Constitution, their families destroyed, their labor exploited, their humanity denied, their religion suppressed.
Now two hundred years have gone by, years of great struggle punctuated in half by civil war, and more recently by nonviolent movement.
While much of the nation paraded and celebrated this great anniversary, a large and growing American underclass still waited for its Declaration of Independence to be announced.
8
The struggle for racial equality has heightened over the past 60 years, years of legal struggles in the courts complimented by other struggles in the streets.
What had its origins as a movement for civil rights has now become a political and economic movement, and Black women and men are winning office and power in numbers only dreamed of before.
But despite an increase of over 150% in the number of Black people holding office, despite our ability to sit or ride or eat or vote in places that formerly lacked Black faces, in a real way we find our condition unchanged.
A quick look at every statistic that measures how well--or how poorly--a group of people are doing, the kinds of figures that measure infant mortality, median family income, life expectancy--these will show rather clearly that while our general condition has improved a great deal, our relative condition has actually managed to get worse.
It is almost as if we were climbing a molasses mountain dressed in snowshoes, while everyone else rides a rather rapid ski lift to the top. Now the ski slopes are more treacherous, the molasses melting into mud, a
9
Sargasso Sea of crime in high places, of joblessness for many, and hopelessness for many more.
Yesterday's gains become suspect. The bus front seat loses meaning for a people whose longest trip is likely to be from the feudal system of the rural South to the more mechanized, high-rise poverty of the North.
The right to vote loses meaning for a people forced to choose between Tweedledum and Tweedledee.
The right to an integrated education can mean little to children bussed from one ignorant academy to another.
The classic civil rights struggles of the sixties were successfully carried forward against discrimination in housing, employment, education and government, both because the victims became their own best champions and because they found a sympathetic ear in the national body politic.
But as the demands became more strident, as a foreign war drained our treasury and young manhood, as our best and brightest were beaten down by bullets, a shift occurred in the national consciousness.
Through New Year's Eve, 1976, the decade of the nineteen seventies has been disaster again for Black people.
10
The combination of the gratuitous gratification of the gross and the greedy, the national nullification of the needs of the needy, and the victory of the politics of penuriousness, prevarication, of pious platitudes and self-righteous swinishness signaled an end to the progress made in the nineteen sixties.
The ten years that went before had seen the number of people officially defined as poor--by government statistic--reduced by nearly one-third. Yet despite these successes, the cruel and callous castrators in Washington moved with cold calculation to freeze and cut back urban renewal, model cities, community action, public service employment, student loans, public housing, federal impact funds for education, and to impose a sixty percent pull-back in social services.
If we were to believe with Thomas Jefferson that the common man ""is the most precious portion of the state,"" we find that precious resource in real danger of economic extinction today.
Now the pattern is being set for what the next four--or eight--years will bring.
The battle must shift now toward achieving the economic democracy that so long has been denied most
11
Americans, and has relegated Black Americans to being a permanent underclass, half subsisting below the poverty line, while the rest work twice as hard to earn half as much as everyone else.
A proper program for the rest of the seventies would include:

income and wealth redistribution through a tax structure that reduces the disparity between the needy and the greedy;
the beginning of the end of poverty through a program of real full employment, supplemented by a negative income tax for workers earning on the margins;
a system of total, lifelong education that would dignify vocational as well as academic training, and permit each American to realize full potential;
free, adequate, cradle-to-grave health care for all Americans, financed through the national treasury and not by profit-making insurance companies;
effective social social control of monopoly, and
12

national, regional, or municipal ownership of vital services, operated for need, and not for profit.

These promise no perfect world, but do hold out the hope that we may create a system of laws and relationships between us that promise more than the present system of privilege for only a few.
To discuss the future at all is risky--none of us has any sure notion of what the next few moments may bring.
We know, or hope, however, that life will go on, that the slow slide from bening concern to malignant neglect can now be reversed.
Racial progress has been measured out in marginal doses to date. The next few years could be the years in which the home of the slave becomes the land of the free, but only if we can continue to insist--in word and deed--that the snail's pace becomes a race.
There can be no better prescription for relieving this crisis, and for reviving some interest in it, than by re-creating a non-partisan national coalition of need, with us as a base, of parents who want care, not warehousing for their children, of workers who want work at a decent
13
and protected wage, of people who work for their living and can't live on what they make as well as those who can't find work but can't live on what we so grudgingly give, of all those people who want an end to welfare and capitalism for the poor and subsidy and socialism for the wealthy and all who must learn that sufficiency for those at the bottom is compatible with stability for those in the middle.…. all those people now live in America, divided now by race and class, fearful of each other, contentious and impotent.
An entire political movement came to near maturity in America in the sixties. Fueled by the fire from the Southern civil rights and national anti-war movements, it threatened to challenge the foundations of the racial and economic arrogance that has created vast reservations of the unwanted on this country's soil.
That movement became the partial victim of its own success. It fought for and won the right to sit in front of the bus, to cast a vote, to sit at a lunch counter. It built the base of a Black political movement in the United States, but it failed to sustain and extend itself.
For too many, social concern began to be measured by the length of our hair, or the trickiness of our handshake.
14
For too many, picking up beer cans by the side of the highway became an acceptable substitute for winning jobs for Black people in the brewery.
We ought to be reminded of some words spoken by Dr. W. E. B. DuBois nearly half a century ago:
""We are American Negroes. It is beside the point to ask whether we form a real race. Biologically, we are mingled of all conceivable elements, but race is psychology, not biology, and psychologically we are a unified race with one history, one red memory, one revolt. It is not ours to argue whether we will be segregated or whether we ought to be a caste. We are segregated; we are a caste. Our problem is: How far and in what way can we consciously and scientifically guide our future so as to insure our physical survival, our spiritual freedom and our social growth? Either we do this or we die. There is no alternative. If America proposed the murder of our group, its moral descent into imbecility and crime and its utter loss of manhood, self-assertion and courage, the sooner we realize this the better. By that great line of McKay, 'If we must die, let it not be like hogs.' But the alternative of not dying like hogs is not that of dying or killing like snarling dogs. It is rather conquering
15
the world by thought and brain and plan; by expression and organized cultural ideals. Therefore, let us not beat futile wings in impotent frenzy; but carefully plan and guide our segregated life, organize in industry and politics to protect it and expand. What will be, no one knows. It may be a great physical segregation of the world along the color line; it may be an economic rebirth which insures spiritual and group integrity amid physical diversity. It may be utter annihilation by class and race and color barriers in one ultimate mankind, differentiated by talent, susceptibility and gift--but any of these ends are matters of long centuries and not years. We live in years, swift, flying, transient years. We hold the possible future in our hands, but not by wish and will, only by thought, plan and organization.""1

This was a third trip for me to what used to be called the dark continent. It was called that both because of the color of its people and also because it was mysterious and dark, populated by different tribes who speak in different tongues and who worship different gods.
Today its map is a crazy quilt of colors representing countries drawn by European hands, respecting no real boundary

The old saying was never more true: ""When the European came, he had the Bible and we had the land--then we had the Bible and he had the land.""
He also had cheap--If not free--labor and an unequaled storehouse of wealth--gold, oil, diamonds, food and fiber, minerals galore.
Today that map is changing fast. Portugal became the last European colony to surrender to the inevitable, and now only three parts of the continent remain under racist rule.
At their core is South Africa.
Three visits do not an expert make, but I would like to share some impressions--and conclusions--which result from this latest trip.
It is difficult to discuss South Africa with Americans who are used to living in a country where civil rights are guaranteed.
Imagine if you will, that in the United States: 

The Black population, 10 to 12% of the total, were the only citizens allowed to vote and own property;
That the majority, 90% of the population that was white, was forced to live on 13% of the land;
3

That Black children were educated freely, by the state, but that white children had to pay to go to public schools;
That no white worker could supervise a Black one;
That no white worker could belong to a labor union, although Black workers could;
That white wages--on the average--were one-sixteenth the wages Black workers received;
That no white person--except the occasional household servant living in a detached servant's home near his or her master's residence--could live in Atlanta, but instead had to commute daily, by train, from Athens to work here;
That white people who had lived in Georgia for three generations were suddenly resettled to an arid corner of New Mexico because their great-grandparents had lived there, even though the new immigrants never had, could not speak the language, and had no desire to move;
That every white citizen had to always carry a passport, granting him permission to be in Athens or Macon or Decatur or Atlanta, and that he could be sent to jail for not having it;
4

That any person, white or Black, could be sent to jail without notice or trial for 120 days, and for another 120 days beyond that, and 120 days more and more, and infinitum;
That any citizens could by government edict become a non-person, his friends forbidden to speak to or visit with him, newspapers forbidden to print his name or report his words;
That 10,000 white children, high school age and younger, had marched peacefully through Five Points, and the city police had opened fire on them, killing 353, wounding more than a thousand;
That a family of white mourners had been machine-gunned into their mourned one's grave;
That whites and Blacks who opposed the government's policy were forbidden to travel to Mexico or Canada;
That our President, Attorney General and other cabinet members had collaborated with the Nazis during the second world war--

If you can imagine that, then you have a mirror image of life in the Republic of South Africa today.
Imagine further that the minority population of the country enjoys the highest standard of living on the continent,
5
a standing built on the backs of the majority.
For those of us in this country who seldom pay much attention to what happens in the next country, let alone the next state, these facts may seem unfortunate, to be sure, but none of our business.
But it is precisely our businesses which keep them afloat, which prop up an economy and a society which constitutes an affront to all decent thinking people everywhere.
350 U.S. corporations have subsidiaries in the Republic of South Africa, including General Motors, Ford, Chrysler, Mobile Oil, Firestone, Goodyear, Union Carbide, Minnesota Mining and Manufacturing, and I.B.M.
By bolstering the South African Economy, and by adhering to its policies of Apartheid, these American businesses stand hand in hand with the most hateful political system on earth.
Having just returned from that section of the world, I can report that no effort for peaceful change will be successful. Only a combination of external and internal pressures, including violence, can hope to alter that situation from what it is today.
For we Americans, it is a situation fraught with danger. We already stand condemned by much of Black Africa for our
6
untimely and illicit entry into the Angolan civil war.
Because our foreign policy has always been dominated by the cold war, and because the Soviet Union and the people's Republic of China have generally supported the liberation movements while we always support the oppressors, our every move in Africa is suspect.
The election of Jimmy Carter and the participation of Black Americans in that victory, both as active early supporters as was Congressman Young, and as voters for Carter, as was nine of every ten Black voters on November 2nd, has raised expectations high in Africa.
Black Americans have long been chided by Africans for not becoming the kind of domestic lobby for them that Jews are for Israel.
The incoming Carter administration will be looked to for tough action against minority rule in Southern Africa, and if it does not develop, then our position as a moral leader will be further eroded.
A word about Secretary Kissinger's negotiations in Rhodesia--or Zimbabwe, as it is known by Africans and soon will be known by us all--is in order here.
During my stay in Africa, it was observed over and over that while Black Africa was pleased that the Secretary 
7
had finally learned there was a Black Africa, they were disturbed that he chose Rhodesia as a beginning point.
That country's economy is in shambles. The three liberation movements--who may argue in Geneva--were inunited in Africa, and were successfully prosecuting a war of attrition which would have caused the downfall of the Smith regime in short order in a few months.
Kissinger's initiatives hastened the negotiations, but the lesson here is that it was the armed struggle which brought Smith to the bargaining table, not the Secretary's silver tongue.
Additionally, the Africans are wary of any secret deals which may--or may not--have been made with Vorster in South Africa in return for his pressure on Ian Smith.
The cancer on that continent is South Africa; the sooner it is arrested and cured, the healthier we all will be. 
A minimal policy in Southern Africa would include the following:

The passage of legislation by Congress requiring American firms doing business in South Africa--and elsewhere--to obey pertinent American law on hiring and promotion and wage rates. Presently South African Blacks earn less than one-sixteenth the wages of their white counterparts, are
8
	forbidden to supervise or direct white workers, and are denied jobs officially reserved for whites.
Strong support for the United Nations arms embargo against South Africa and sanctions against those--including our allies--who break it.
The withholding of visa privileges to white South Africans until the Pretoria government grants the right of travel to all Americans, and not a selected few.
Repeal of the Byrd amendment which allows American business to violate the economic boycott against Rhodesia.
Increased educational aid to independent states bordering on South Africa so that student refugees and exiles can continue their training.
Immediate recognition of Angola and continued opposition to recognition of the South African Bantustans.
The immediate withdrawal of American military attaches from South Africa.

Flying from Johannesburg to Rio last Saturday on a jumbo jet, one by one South Africans approached the Americans who had attended the Lesotho conference.
""You do not understand,"" they said, almost to a man.
We understood enough to know that pitiable excuse was used by those who justified having Blacks sit in the back of
9
the bus, who justified Georgia's old twenty questions which kept Blacks from the franchise, who justified segregated drive-in movie theatres by telling those of us who wanted change that we did not understand.
South Africa is today's equivalent of Germany under Hitler, and ought to be dealt with in the same way by the rest of the world.

Flying from Johannesburg to Rio last Saturday on a jumbo jet, one by one South Africans approached the Americans who had attended the Lesotho conference. 
""You do not understand,"" they said, almost to a man.
We understood enough to know that pitiable excuse was used by those who justified having Blacks sit in the back of the B bus, who justified Georgia's old 20 questions which kept Blacks from the franchise, who justified segregated drive-in movie theaters by telling those of us who wanted change that we did not understand. 
South Africa is today's equivalent of Germany under Hitler, and ought be dealt with in the same way by the rest of the world.

""American Black people must make the struggle of Southern Africa our fight too,"" Georgia State Senator Julian Bond said this week.
Bond had spent a week in the kingdom of Lesotho, completely surrounded by South Africa, as one of 60 Americans attending a conference on African-American relations.
Sponsored by the African-American Institute, the meeting brought together American political, labor, business and civil rights figures who met with their African counterparts to discuss American policy toward Southern Africa.
Like many of the other Americans, Bond was denied a transit visa to pass through white-minority ruled South Africa.
Bond said the meeting arrived at no official conclusions, but that the Black American delegates returned ""with a greater determination to uproot the Nazi-like racist regime in South Africa.""
""Black young people in South Africa are struggling now with their lives,"" Bond said. ""The least we can do is to apply all available pressures on the new administration to act swiftly to insure majority rule in Southern Africa.""
""If Black Americans are to have an influence on both domestic and foreign policy over the next several years, then
2
a new policy toward Black africa ought to be first on the foreign policy agenda,"" Bond said.
At a minimum, Bond said, a new African policy should include the following:

the passage of legislation by Congress requiring American firms doing business in South Africa--and elsewhere--to obey pertinent American law on hiring and promotion and wage rates. Presently South African Blacks earn less than 1/16 the wages of their white counterparts, are forbidden to supervise or direct white workers, and are denied jobs officially reserved for whites.
strong support for the United Nations arms embargo against South Africa and sanctions against those--including our allies--who break it.
the withholding of visa privileges to white South Africans until the Pretoria government grants the right of travel to all Americans, and not a selected few.
repeal of the Byrd Amendment which allows American business to violate the economic boycott against Rhodesia.
increased educational aid to independent states bordering on South Africa so that student refugees and exiles can continue their training.
immediate recognition of Angola and continued opposition to recognition of the South African bantustans.
the immediate withdrawal of American military attaches from South Africa.

For ourselves, Bond said, we each returned with a renewed determination to do all we can to isolate South Africa and to prepare for the inevitable armed struggle which will come.

In the century since then, Meharry and Howard University's School of Medicine have graduated over one-half of the practicing Black physicians in the United States.
Begun as a one-room missionary-run school, Meharry now trains over one-third of all those Blacks who will be doctors. Nearly 80 per cent of her graduates work in urban or rural poverty areas. From the days when anatomy and physiology shared the
2
curriculum with reading and writing, the Meharry Medical College has nearly one thousand students from 49 states, over 300 faculty members, a 65-acre campus, and an annual budget of over $30 million. Even in the few--very, very few years--since I was born at Hubbard Hospital, delivered into life by a physician trained at Meharry, in a time when no Black woman could receive courteous treatment at any other hospital in Nashville, the school has grown by leaps and bounds.
Five years after I was born, the South where Meharry hoped to prosper was spending twice as much to educate white children as it spent on Black ones. It paid four times as much for white school plants, paid white teachers salaries 30 per cent higher, spent $42 million dollars busing white children to school and only $1 million for Black ones, the percentage of whites finishing high school was four times that for Blacks. The Southern states were spending $86 millions of tax dollars on white colleges and only $5 million on Black ones. There was not a single institution in the South where a Black student could receive a Ph.D.
That Meharry survived the national retreat following Reconstruction as well as the studied indifference of its region in its first 100 years is nothing less than a miracle.
3
It faces a different kind of challenge today. A diagnosis carefully done would suggest that while the Southern region has changed and prospered, and while the sorry statistics quoted a second before have been radically altered, schools like Meharry will now be called upon to meet not just the challenge of the past, but to fight new battles as well.
It was not until 1968 that the number of minorities-- Blacks, Native Americans, Mexican Americans, Mainland Puerto Ricans--accepted into M.D. programs climbed past 200 a year. In all the years of medical education in the United States, never before had more than 200 students of color been admitted at any one time to the country's medical schools. In 1968, the figure jumped to 292. A year later, in 1969, the number nearly doubled to 501. Between 1968 and 1976, the number of first-year minority medical school students had jumped from 200 to 1,391. These increases were due to the pressures of the federal government, the availability of foundation funds, and the general turmoil of Black students, who insisted, in the 60s, that a space--in medical school and in life--would have to be created for them.
But because Black Americans have always been a people on a see-saw--going up in one direction while going down in 
4
another--a regression has set in. Last school year showed a marked decline in medical school minority enrollment, and the figures for this year's classes are expected to be worse. Thus, between the '74-'75 school year and the '75-'76 school year, the number of minority students dropped from 1,473 to 1,391; the number of American Indians in that total decreased from 71 to 60; of Blacks, from 1,106 to 1,036. Only the number of Puerto Rican students increased, and that only by three, from 69 to 71.
Put another way, Black people are 12 per cent of the country's population but only 2.2 per cent of the doctors. There are over 5 million Mexican Americans in this country--only 250 of them are doctors. There are nearly a million Native Americans here; only 72 are doctors. While there is one white physician for every 536 white people, for Blacks the ratio is one to 13,888. To bring the figures in line with what they ought to be, the country would have to produce 29,000 additional Black doctors immediately. (These are comforting statistics only if you believe that white people are sicker than Black people are.) The overwhelming bulk of the support to make these figures more equitable has come from private foundations. Over the last ten years, more than
5
$179 million dollars has been contributed by private foundations to increase college and graduate school education for Blacks. But this amount has begun to slow down. Over the last four years, $478 million was granted by foundations to improve health education generally in America; of that total, $115 million was spent on medical education specifically, and less than $24 million--five per cent--was spent to help educate minorities.
What it all means is that schools like Meharry increasingly have to depend on their own resources, their friends and the alumni to help them make it through the night.
The pattern of neglect, of some small support, and then abandonment afflicts not just the Meharries of this world--it is a design all too familiar to us all.
If the problem of money itself weren't severe enough, it is complicated by a shrinking pool of students available to seek a medical education. These students suffer not just because their pockets are empty, but additionally because they represent the end product of a still too separate system of education which afflicts them as they begin to enter the first grade.
That in turn is a reflection of their whole lives, and that lived by their parents before them. It is a reflection
6
of being Black in the United States in the 200th year of our national history, 200 years after the beginning of the great debate, the national experiment called democracy.
That it was meant by many to be an experiment only is quite clear; not many of us have yet been allowed to try it out.
In a few short days we will enter year 201. For many of us, it will represent a sort of dream come true, and the bringing down of the cotton curtain that has separated this nation for so long. In a few weeks, the son of the South, elevated to the Presidency by the grandsons and daughters of slaves his forebears may have owned, will become the new President of the United States.
This then is as good a time as any to take our national pulse and temperature, to discover what maladies still plague us, to examine the body politic, and to determine whether radical surgery is yet needed to restore the patient to health.
There can be no denying that Black people are better off now than ever before in many ways.
We can sit in the front of busses. We can work, study, eat, sleep, vote and live in places where we once could not. We are able to help elect Presidents and decide the fate of this nation. But at the same time, we've moved from the back
7
of the bus to the front of the unemployment lines, from segregated schools run by us to ignorant academies and the yellow school bus, from the rural poverty of the South to high rise subsistence in the North.
Like the rest of the United States, we are the victims of the last eight years of government by veto and crime in the suites.
We have suffered the creation of a national coalition of the comfortable, the callous and the cruel, who've closed their minds, their hearts and their ranks to the claims and calls to conscience put forward by the forgotten and unrepresented elements in American society.
From the late sixties until today, their actions have resulted in the national nullification of the needs of the needy, the gratuitous gratification of the gross and the greedy, a triumph for the politics of prevarication, penuriousness, of pious platitudes and self-righteous swinishness. Now these forces have been upset, and another yet unknown force prepares to take power. In the years gone by, we've seen the rather narrow gains of the early sixties slip away.
A quick look at all the statistics that measure either how well or how poorly a group of people are doing--the kinds
8
of figures that measure infant morality, median family income, life expectancy--these will demonstrate rather clearly that while our general condition has improved, our relative condition has actually managed to get worse.
It is almost as though we were climbing a molasses mountain dressed in snowshoes, while everyone else rides a rather swift ski-lift to the top. Now the ski slopes are more treacherous, the molasses melting into mud, a Sargasso Sea of crime in high places, of joblessness for many and hopelessness for many more.
The struggles we fought in the 1960s were carried forward with some success against discrimination in housing, employment, and government, both because the victims became their own best champions, and because they found a sympathetic ear in the national consciousness.
But as the demands of the 1960s became more insistent, as a foreign war drained our treasury and young man-hood, as our best and out brightest were beaten down by bullets, a shift began to occur in the national mood.
This change was reflected in the elections of '68 and '72 when a fever ran rampant through America. The second of these contests was more a rout than an election, a rout which re-installed the fiscal facists, the merciless merchants of
9
the cost accounting school of social welfarism in the White House, and insured a four-year reign for men with an arrogant contempt for people and their problems.
An old blues singer once said: some men kill with bullets; others kill with the stroke of a pen.
The frightening governmental acts of the last eight years, fostered by an impotent Congress, a Congress unable to resist Presidential vetoes, impoundments, cut-backs, shifts in sharing and reverses in revenue--all these cut sharpest at the people at the bottom, those who traditionally look to their government for some help.
If the years that went before--the Kennedy and the Johnson years--had taught us any lesson at all, it ought to have been that government, under militant and concerted pressure, would move, slowly and rather ponderously, all too often with all deliberate lack of speed, to become a limited partner of sorts with the American underclass in their struggle to do better for themselves. The last few years have changed all that. The government's attitude toward the poor and powerless has changed from benign concern to malignant neglect.
In the ten years of the 1960s, the number of people living in poverty--as defined by government statistic--was
10
reduced by nearly one-third. It's not at all unusual to ascribe some of these gains to the Great Society and New Frontier programs of that era. Yet despite these successes, the cruel and callous castrators moved with cold calculation to kill, freeze, and wind down urban renewal, model cities, community action, public service employment, student loans, public housing, federal impact funds for education, and to impose a sixty per cent national pull-back in social services. If we are to believe with Thomas Jefferson that the common man ""is the most precious portion of the state,"" we find that precious resource in danger of economic extinction today.
Human problems are now placed on a balance sheet, forced to add up, to pay profit for themselves. The current crop of administrations in Washington run the programs they direct with all the solicitude of a hungry mortician at an old folks home.
While the nation waltzed into the '60s believing that its ""Black problem"" had either been burned or blown away, infant mortality rates for us remained twice as high as for everyone else; nearly half the Black families in the United States earned less that $5,000 a year; the average Black American male was still dying seven years earlier than his
11
white counterpart, we remained the last to be hired and the first to be fired. We have reached this particular and precarious position because of a series of events of the 1960s. The nonviolent--and in retrospect--lovable marchers of the first part of that decade began to be replaced, if not in fact then certainly in the public fancy, by the rapacious rioters of the latter part of the sixties. America's major cities were believed to be either in flames, under martial law, or sinking under the dead wight of a population of pensioners, the unemployed young, or their presumably unemployable parents. The middle mind of Americans was running away from social concerns in a crisis state all their own. They quite rightly perceived that their taxes--higher proportionately than those paid by their pernicious President in the past--were escalating to pay for barely maintaining what they were running away from, but they were wrongly taught, by their President and others, that their taxes were high because of the lazy poor, and not because of the corporate evader of the military glutton.
The rhetoric from Washington about sharing the wealth became a scandalous excuse for concentrating wealth and power where they always were, away from the cities, away from the
12
children, away from people for whom wealth is an extra meal and for whom power the ability to hide from the census taker.
The often repeated connection then between today's dilemma and the end of the Reconstruction era 100 years ago is more than frightening.
A national administration had concluded--then as now--that private profit and public arrogance could be pursued at the expense of the people living on the American margin.
Concurrently, many of the formerly liberal crusaders for social justice and democracy became tired, or involved in other, less traumatic concerns.
For many of them, picking up beer cans by the side of the public highway became an acceptable substitute to winning jobs in the brewery for Black people.
The aspirations of and movement by Black people began to be curtailed, not by organized violence and barbarity, but by a series of nationally choreographed legal and extra legal manuevers designed to make us less than political and economic equals.
The frenetic--and often frantic--activity of the 1960s had created a political climate characterized by selfishness and fear; a political constituency was recruited from the
13
frightened to form solid ranks against the forgotten.
Backlash is too hackneyed a term for a people confused by long hair and frightened by clenched fists, their politics misdirected by those who verbally oppose crime in the streets but secretly practice crime in the suites. This manipulation of the American mind has made the mundane magnificant, and placed government in the hands of men who believe in privilege for the powerful and neglect of the powerless.
There can be no better prescription for relieving this crisis, and for reviving some interest in it, than by re-creating a non-partisan national coalition of need, with us as base, of parents who want care, not warehousing for their children, of workers who want work for their living and can't live on what they make as well as those who can't find work but can't live on what we so grudgingly give, of all those people who want an end to welfare and capitalism for the poor and subsidy and socialism for the wealthy and all who must learn that sufficiency for those at the bottom is compatible with stability for those in the middle....all those people now live in America, divided now by race and class, fearful of each other, contentious and impotent.
14
An entire political movement came to near maturity in America in the sixties. Fueled by the fire from the Southern civil rights movement, it threatened to challenge the foundations of the racial arrogance that has created vast reservations of the unwanted on this country's soil.
That movement became the partial victim of its own success. It fought for and won the right to sit in front of the bus, to cast a vote, to sit at a lunch counter. It launched a Southern Black political movement, but it failed to sustain and extend itself, and instead saw itself dissipated by struggles on the edge.
For some of us, being Black became a rhetorical or sartorial accomplishment.
For many, social commitment began to be measured by the length of your hair, or the intricacy of your handshake.
Many of the young people who some years ago marched with us militantly in the streets are now found running nude on the college grounds, attempting to prove perhaps, that all man are not created equal.
The political process needs to be put to a constant test, not as an election day effort alone, but as another weapon in an arsenal that has always contained more pop guns than howitzers.
15
For our purposes this evening, that means mounting a never ending attack on the national illness that has left too many of us ill housed, ill educated, unemployed and sick in body and mind.
For the friends and supporters of Meharry Medical College, it means giving and giving even more. 80 per cent of the medical students at Meharry and 86 per cent of the dental students need--and received--financial aid.
If they are to go forward to heal others living in an unwell world, and if their numbers are to increase, then they need your help.
We are moving--not too swiftly--away from the days when we thought others' ice was colder, sugar sweeter, and medicine stronger.
We have some strong medicine of our own, at schools like Meharry and in the hearts and minds of their students and graduates.
You have helped to make them stronger.

Meharry Medical College (1876-)
Meharry Medical College originated in 1876 as the medical division of Central Tennessee College, an institution established by the Freedmen's Aid Society of the Methodist Episcopal Church. The founder and first president of Meharry Medical College was New Hampshire native George Whipple Hubbard (1841-1921), a former Union soldier who received his medical degree from the University of Nashville. While still in school, Hubbard began the work of building Meharry, with himself as sole instructor, religious advisor, and superintendent.
Meharry's dental and pharmaceutical departments were organized in 1866 and 1889, respectively. There was only one member in the first graduating class in 1890; he held the degree of Master of Arts. In 1910, the School of Nursing of Mercy Hospital was transferred to Meharry. The Hubbard Hospital was built in 1917. On October 13, 1915, Meharry Medical College was granted a charter separate from Central Tennessee College, which had changed its name to Walden University in 1900.
On February 1, 1921, John J. Mullowney, a 1908 graduate of the University of Pennsylvania and a form faculty member of Gerard College in Philadelphia, became the second president of Meharry. Under his leadership, admission requirements were rigorously administered; the number of faculty members increased; research and hospital facilities were expanded, increasing the bed capacity to 100; outpatient clinics were reorganized according to specialty; and a hospital superintendent was employed. In 1923, Meharry was given an ""A"" rating. With contributions from the General Education Board and the Rockefeller, Rosenwald, Eastman, and Carnegie foundations, together with assistance from the city of Nashville and Meharry alumnae, the college moved from South Nashville to its present location in North Nashville, adjacent to Fisk University. 
In 1938, the distinguished scholar Edward L. Turner assumed the post of press. Turner modified the curriculum of the medical school, insisting on a more scientific approach and stressing the importance of proper clinical procedures. During this time, Meharry began to experience financial difficulties, which plagued the institution throughout the 1940s. President Turner resigned in 1944. Dr. M.D. Clawson served as president of Meharry from 1945 to 1950.
An interim administrative committee directed affairs until 1952, when Dr. Harold D. West, the first black president of the school, began his term. Under West, fiscal expansion was planned and a twenty million dollar fund-raising drive was initiated. Land adjacent to the campus was purchased, and a new wing was added to the hospital. Under a re-definition of purpose, the School of Nursing and the Division of Dental Technology were terminated in the early 1960s, and significant improvements were made to the curriculum and facilities in the schools of medicine and dentistry.                                                                                                           
Page 2 of 2
From 1966 to 1968, Meharry was managed by an interim committee until the dean of the medical school, Lloyd Elam, was appointed president. Meharry then established a graduate school offering the Ph.D. degree in the basic sciences and a School of Allied Health Professions in conjunction with T. S. U. and Fisk University. New buildings for the schools of medicine and dentistry and a new hospital building were constructed in the 1970s. Elam provided Meharry with thirteen years of progressive leadership. He continued his service to the school as a distinguished member of the teaching faculty. 
In March of 1982, Richard Lester, chairman of the Department of Radiology of the University of Texas Science Center and a member of Meharry's board of trustees, assumed the duties of interim president for one year. In July of 1982, David Satcher became the third black man to hold the position of president. He served until 1993 and was followed by President John Maupin.
Meharry Medical College includes the School of Medicine, the School of Dentistry, the School of Graduate Studies and Research, the School of Allied Health Professions, the George Russell Towers of Hubbard Hospital, two health centers, and the Harold D. West Basic Sciences Center.

It began as a conservative time, the celebration of the status quo, when young men and women who called themselves ""Black"" invited the scorn of their elders still fighting to be called capital ""N"" Negroes. If our history was not familiar
2
to the nation, our status was painfully clear. A people whose passage to these shores had been described as ""one long line of blood, with tossing limbs and the echoing cries of death and pain,""1 we had been declared a problem--by the same group who created the ""problem"", then neglected to develop a solution.
It was a landmark year for young Blacks; the question ""Where were you during the sit-ins"" would become as much a part of the national Black litany as a recitation of one's whereabouts at the moment of the murders of John and Bobby Kennedy, or Martin Luther King.
To millions of Black teenagers today, the sit-ins, lie-ins and marches, the hoses, cattle prods and jails, the fractured skulls and shallow graves that marked the bloody sixties are already distant history, replete with revisionism and
3
fractured skulls and shallow graves that marked the bloody sixties are already distant history, replete with revisionism and indistinguishable from television docu-drama. To Black adults, the ""protests"" symbolized a passing of the torch, unorthodox extensions of the struggle long waged through traditional channels--the NAACP, churches, voter's leagues, and ""sitting up"" with the white folks. Predictably, some Blacks deplored the new activism as jeopardizing existing gains.
It was true that Black people had progressed since our arrival in 1620 on the inhospitable shores of the newly-stolen land. We were no longer bartered and used like plows and bags of seed. We were better off than the four million freed
4
at Emancipation who set about to raise families and make a living without, for the most part, skills, money, and land. We had survived Reconstruction, Jim Crow, Lynch Law, disenfranchisement, discrimination, and segregation. Survived several depressions, two great wars, and the witch hunts of the McCarthy era. We had survived--although some of us didn't recognize his symptoms in time to prevent a national disgrace--the ""Checkers"" speech of the man who this year proclaimed himself a ""paranoid for peace"" and claimed his prize of $600,000 on the television spectacle, ""Deface the Nation.""
Through it all, we had struggled to climb out of degradation, poverty, illiteracy; to get--and keep--a decent job,
5
and to insure a better life for our children. And in 1960, when a new President asked what we could do for our country, the answer was soon forthcoming.
Setting aside intellectual discussion in favor of organization, young Blacks tested political theory with their feet. Dialectic took a back seat to a lunch counter sit-in, to drinking from a certain water fountain; to riding the bus in the seat of our choice, and registering to vote for the candidate of our choosing. Lives were changed, and some were lost, along the way. Mrs. Fannie Lou Hamer, whose death earlier this year was not so much from disease as from living and fighting for human rights in rural Mississippi, summed it up: ""We didn't come for
6
no two seats 'cause all of us is tired!""
The nation was changed along the way, grudgingly, painfully. Not a sector has gone unaffected: federal money flows in new directions; Blacks hold office in formerly white enclaves; bureaucracies proliferate; lawsuits, rulings and legislation abound; quotas sprout at every hand; experts and scholars monitor, interpret and predict our activity.
Because our lives change so rapidly in some ways, yet remain so stagnant in others, it is imperative that we pause to review our condition. Federal figures provide a statistical measuring stick:2
We are eleven percent of the population, or 23.4 million
7
people. Our numbers have doubled since 1940; although our birth rate declines, we increase at faster rate than whites. 53% of Blacks live in the South, although nearly one-and-a-half million migrated since 1960. 76% live in metropolitan areas, with 13.7 million living in central cities. Our life expectancy has doubled since 1900, although a male child born in 1974 can expect to live only 62.9 years, while white men live six more. Our infant and maternal death rates continue to decline, although three Black women still die in childbirth for every white. We are more likely to be homicide or suicide victims. Illiteracy has dropped, but at a slower rate than whites.
Unemployment rates have soared for Blacks, but more than nine million of us held jobs in 1975, nearly fifty percent
8
more than in 1960. In that year, when the median income for Black families was $3233., 46.5% of us earned less than $3,000., and fewer than one percent earned more than $15,000. By 1975, the median income for Black families had risen to $9321., while 11.4% of us remained below the $3,000. level, and more than 26% earned over $15,000. While that median figure is only 65% of 1975 white earnings, we are ten percent closer to equality in wages than in 1960. Nearly one of two Black women are employed, but more than 54% of working Black mothers with children under 18 live below the poverty level, compared to 34% of white women so situated.
Unemployment among Black teenagers reached a shocking
9
forty percent during October 1976, twice the 1970 rate. 7.5 million, or one of every three Black people, continue to live below the poverty level, as compared with one of ten whites. 63% of poor Black families now are headed by women. Nearly four million Black children live in poverty, of whom one-third live with only one parent, on less than $3,000. a year, on welfare, and inadequate diets, and in substandard housing. Welfare dollars counted for one of every eight dollars of the Black woman's income, compared to one of every fifty dollars for white women.
The government survey notes that Blacks now own nearly as many television sets as whites, as many refrigerators -- and yet we put less in them -- the median Black eats 200 few calories
10
worth of food per day than does the median white.
Nearly all children, Black and white alike, are enrolled in elementary school, but only one of every 33 recipients of the doctorate degree in 1975 was Black. Despite the shockingly high drop-out rate for Black high school youths, some one million now attend college, four times the number in 1964. One out of four white college age youth are enrolled, but only little more than one of six Blacks, while enrollment in professional schools remains at less than five percent.
The Federal government claims to have increased its 1964 outlay of $7.9 billion to enefit persons below the poverty level, by nearly 400%. In 1974, they say, $27.0 billion went for
11
direct-dollar and non-income benefits; the cost, they say, of maintaining cash payments, food and housing, health, education, manpower, community action and social service programs. That amount, enormous as it may seen, was ten billion dollars less than the annual receipts from corporation income taxes, ten billion dollars less than the federal payroll, and slightly more than the interest paid on the public debt -- all in that same year.
This is not to suggest that $27. billon went to benefit 7.5 million poor Blacks: 23.4 million Americans lived somewhere below that arbitrary level, and 15.7 million of them were white.
Meanwhile, Black people, lulled by the unfamiliar sound
12
of federal dollars -- our tax dollars -- flowing into pockets and programs, may be tempted to relax in our comparative affluence and anticipate a golden age. Self-congratulation is premature and complacency is self-delusion. While we struggle to raise ourselves over the ""mudsill level,"" the nation's economy turned from the industrial to the post-industrial stage, from lavish affluence launched on largely borrowed capital, to a floundering, debt-ridden post-affluent society.
The present economic system, based on traditional assumptions, steeped in the Keynesian theories of the thirties, defies analysis in any but the narrowest terms. Social policies, modeled on the thumb-in-the-dike method of flood control, fluctuate
13
from paternalistic to genocidal in theory and in practice. Public and private sector advisers, possessing that uniquely American cashbox mentality, exhibit a knee-jerk rejection of new ideas. The ""radical liberals"" in pursuit of social equality are deadlocked with the ""America First"" contingent, as public policy is debated in either/or, win/lose terms: jobs or inflation, jobs or clean environment, freedom or law-and-order. Persons with common sense are beginning to ask if it is not possible to have both, while the Joint Economic Committee of the Congress issued a study, ""Prospects, Problems and Patterns in U.S. Economic Growth through 1986.""3
Economics, demographers, and futurists, committed to
14
the conservation of our basic resources of land, labor, capital, and knowledge, addressed the problems of inflation, unemployment, capital shortages, fiscal crises, decaying transportation systems, human crises, nuclear hazards, and global interdependence. I would add to that list what Dr. W.E.B. DuBois called ""The greater problem, which obscures the basic one--the problem of the color line--is the fact that so many civilized persons are willing to live in comfort even if the price of this is poverty, ignorance and disease of the majority of their fellow man; that to maintain this privilege men have have waged war--and the excuse for this war continues largely to be color and race.""4
Blacks who have long placed their ""Faith in education as
15
the lever of racial progress""5 received scant encouragement from the prediction of demographer Stephen P. Dresch:* ""Will the historical relationship between education and individual income continue to be observed in the future?"" he asks. ""The general conclusion (is) fundamentally negative..."" Dresch foresees that ""as a result of the reduced rate of population growth a pervasive process of aging will occur, affecting... those occupations in which the highly educated are disproportionately represented... (the change) will displace significant numbers of workers, especially the highly educated, for whom displacement will be most traumatic... saturation of the highly educated labor market and career disruptions will lead to major changes in
16
patterns of schooling behavior; schooling will cease to provide a mechanism for inter-generational vertical mobility and improvement in material welfare, and in fact, for a significant fraction of the population, children may well achieve significantly lesser material welfare than their parents.""6
The prospect of even a temporary interruption in upward mobility is chilling to Blacks who less than seventy-five years ago saw men ""studying alphabets in the field, holding the 'blue-back speller' with one hand while they guided the plow with the other.""7 Our harsh experience anticipated Dresch's observation that ""the most significant transfer of wealth from parent to child is the investment in education--human capital--of the child...as a critical determinant of earnings, education
17
constitutes one of the primary bases of social status and class identification... a mechanism by which an avowed national commitment to equality could be served.""8
Those who hold with Dr. DuBois that ""the object of all true education is not to make men carpenters, but to make carpenters men""9 may find reassurance in the forecasts of professor and author James O'Toole.** Calling for better use of human resources-- not harder work, but smarter work -- he outlines a future state, the quality society: ""By keeping work as the central activity of society, it is possible to create policies to achieve... the fullest development of human resources, the careful use of natural resources, a clean and healthy environment, safe and high quality
 
18
goods, economic efficiency, individual liberty, and full participation in democratic decision-making processes...""10
For most of us, involvement in the democratic decision-making process is limited to domestic policy in the home: shall we pay the fuel bill or the rent, buy a pound of coffee or a tank of gas. Our association with national policy makers is limited to encounters at the television set. We are vaguely aware that ""power"" is acquired through winning a seat in Congress or wangling a Presidential appointment, but seldom realize the pervasive influence of the federal role. The men who divide the federal dollar establish priorities that order our lives. Federal dollars create jobs. O'Toole12 shows that the number of jobs resulting from each $1 billion spent by the federal government can go as high
19
as 90,000 when allocated to educational programs. For every billion designated for highway construction, 51,000 new jobs are created, while the same dollars used for public housing construction make opportunities for 76,000 workers.12
The task of creating alternatives for the future of all Americans demands the talents of our finest men and women. Able -- as O'Toole puts it--to liberate policy analysis from the crippling constraints of the anachronistic economic paradigm to which it is currently tied.""13 We are not so credulous as to entrust the job to those who have long abused us, and in whose councils we remain under-represented.
Black people who voted for Jimmy Carter last November believed we had finally helped elect a man openly commited to ending the
20
old policies of callousness, contempt and containment. We gave Carter 91% of our vote, and made the difference in thirteen states, states in which he received 216 of the 270 electoral votes needed to win. We constituted twenty precent of the votes cast for the Democrat ticket. A vote implies a promissory note; it is becoming painfully clear, now the dust of the first hundred days has drifted away, that note is not being honored. It was written on the wind, by those who naively negotiated blocs of our votes. No list of demands was presented in the transaction, surely, no commitments are forthcoming.
With DuBois, ""I do not for a moment argue that political power will immediately abolish color caste, make
21
ignorant men intelligent or bad men good... I maintain that political power is the beginning of all permanent reform and the only hope for maintaining gains.""14 ""... There is progress, and clear progress, but it is slow and gradual, and difficult to measure exactly... (but) all this will not settle the real problem of American Negroes, because that problem will still be what we do with the increased wage, extension of education, better home surroundings, and the right to vote. What are these privileges for?
"" Are we going to try to increase the wealth of the richest by climbing on the faces of the poorest among us? Are we going to use our education for enjoyment or for service? Are our homes
22
going to be centers of gorging and gambling entertainment or for civilization? With the right to vote, what are we going to vote for? Why are we going to vote? What kind of social organization are we going to build?
""...The core of the problem of American Negroes is not discrimination but a question of ideal and ability. Discrimination hinders the formation of ideals and the emerging of ability. But the doing away with discrimination will never settle these matters-- rather it opens the way for us to face the real problems of life.
The discovery and recognition of unusual ability among Americans of Negro descent... had put an end to the question as to whether Negroes can accomplish results in the higher fields of human endeavor... (but) they may think of their preferment chiefly as their personal accomplishment... they may look upon
23
their careers as American, not Negro; withdrawing themselves from the Negro group as far as possible.
""If they do this, they will fail to recognize how much that cultural group has meant to them, how tremendously it has inspired them to effort, and how a large sum has been given by poor unlettered Black folk to education and training.… Repayment for this cannot be made to persons and organizations, but it can be made by extending opportunities for other persons within the Negro group to .. gain recognition for unborn talent. CConsiderable as is the number of Negroes who have reached recognized accomplishment, the great mass of talent among us is still hidden and buried by the lack of education, encouragement, and opportunity.""15

From every corner of the Peach State, we are gathered here in Macon to discuss the future of Black Georgians, and to determine whether we will go forward, stand stagnant, or continue sliding backward into a past no one wants to relive again.
It is difficult now to tell exactly how we are doing in 1977. Politically, we can claim credit for some impressive victories. We are roughly 29% of the state's population, and roughly 25.9% of the state's registered voters.
We have voted into office 259 Blacksinto elected officials office across the state, but we must remember that those they constitute only 3.5% of the more than 7,000 elected officials in the state.
We are proud of the Black men and women who serve in our state legislature, but we must remember that they make up less than 10% of the legislative total.
We know that there are 23 counties in this state where we are the majority of the population but in only one - Hancock - where do we control the reins of government.
We know that the Governor of the state of Georgia sits where he does because large numbers of us turned out to vote for him in 1974, but we wonder almost daily if he knows that the Black hands that pulled the levers that put him into power and now would like to pull some wages from the state into their pockets.
Most importantly for us as Georgians - and as Americans - we know that there sits in the White house today a son of our native soil who was , a man raised from the obscurity of rural Georgia to the ] 3 highest office in the land because Black Georgians placed their reputations on the line.
When he made cruel cracks were made about ethnic purity, Blacks from Georgia laid on healing hands, and the illness passed away.
When white Southerners turned their back on their regional brother, Black Southerners responded last November and give him the margin of victory in 13 states whose electoral votes gave the winning side him 216 of the 270 votes they he needed to win.
Now we hope we haven't voted for a man who knew the words to our hymns, but not the numbers on our paychecks.
In the twelve months since we voted in such record numbers, nearly 100,000 Black Americans have lost jobs they had before.
Nationally, the unemployment rate for Blacks has climbed to higher than twice that for whites. For some young Black men, it has reached as high as 50%. ] 4
The new administration has won many friends for its forthright stand in favor of human rights across the globe.
But increasingly Black Georgians - and other Americans as well - are asking for some attention to human rights here at home.
If the rights of Jews in Russia are important - and they are - then surely too the rights of Blacks in America are too.
If the rights of the citizens of Chile, suffering under a dictatorship a previous American administration purchased into power are important, then the rights of the poor in Chicago are important too.
If we are to worry about political freedom for enslaved Blacks in South Africa - and we do - then we must worry about economic freedom for Black people in South Carolina.
Let me read something to you from another Georgian, a Black man, born in a public housing project on Atlanta's West Side, had to say about this administration in July of this year. His name is Vernon Jordan, and he said then: He said:
""The Administration has formulated a new foreign policy, a new defense policy, and a new energy policy. But it has not adequately addressed itself to a new domestic policy. We have no full employment ] 5 policy .............. We have no national health policy. We have no agressive affrimative action policy. We have no national solutions to the grinding problems of poverty and discrimination.""
""To paraphrase Winston Churchill. 'Never have so many expected so much and received so little.'""
""A limited jobs program is not enough. An enlightened jobs policy is not enough. An expanded housing policy is not enough. A handful of to Black appointments is not enough. An open style without substantive change is not enough. It is not enough to do better than Nixon and Ford. Black people didn't vote for Nixon and Ford, they voted for Carter, and it is not enough to be just a little better than his predecessors.""
""Black people, having tasted the sweetness of victory in November, resent the sour taste of disappointment in July. Black people and poor people resent the stress on balanced budgets instead of balanced lives. We resent unfulfilled promises of jobs, ] 6 compromises to win conservative support, and the continued acceptance of high unemployment."" 1
What Vernon Jordan said then - and others said before and since - demonstrates that we may have learned a lot about elections, but haven't yet learned much about governing.
Over the long years that the NAACP has labored in the fields to win the right to equal pay for teachers, the right to vote and sit at lunch counters, the right to an equal education in the state system our tax dollars help pay for, the right to work at jobs where no Black man or woman had worked before, we have seen some marvelous changes come into our lives.
When the 20th Century began, Black Georgians were slaves in every way but legally. Almost none of us could vote. Few of us enjoyed any public education, and those who did studied for only a few short months each year. We were a rural population, tied to land we did not own by others who nearly owned us. ] 7
77 years later, much of this has changed, and changed for the better. Most of us have escaped the farm for the city. Most of us are now able to vote, even if many choose not to do so. Most of our children now go to schools that are integrated by law, if segregated by fact. We have now become doctors, lawyers, teachers, politicians - have spread ourselves across the entire spectrum of employment.
Yet even this progress, as impressive as it is, serves to hide the discouraging facts of Black life in American in 1977. A quick look at every statistic that measures either how well - or how poorly a group of people are doing - the kinds of figures that measure infant mortality, median family income, life expectancy - will demonstrate that while our general condition has improved a great, great deal, our relative condition has actually managed to get worse. ] 8
It is almost as though we were climbing a molasses mountain dressed in snowshoes, while everyone else rides in rather rapid ski lift to the top.
The most recent census study tells the story starkly. When it was taken, there were 400,000 Black men and women working employed in Georgia. Of that number 24,000 were professional or technical workers, fewer than 7,000 were managers and administrators, while more than half of all of us in Georgia who work at all are were employed as laborers, farm workers, and domestic servants.
And of course, we have always been twice as many of those who haven't any job at all.
Obviously, we have yet to transalate our growing political power any any kind of economic power at all, and despite the fact that 68% of us are registered to vote, have yet to make that mean more than a few Black faces in the state's high places.
In addition to registereing more Black voters, and teaching ] 9 those already registered how important the vote can be, we have a major job to do in influencing those white office holders who come to our churches the Sunday before election day and then won't ever be seen with us again.
The one hundred and thirty-fifth session of the Georgia General Assembly will convene in Atlanta on January 9, 1978. One of the more than 2,000 bills and regulations these men and women elected by you will consider is a modest proposal to raise the average award to families with dependent children by two dollars and eight cents.
This will raise the average monthly award from $37.16 to $39.24 for 238,266 Black and white mothers of dependent children.
Since Georgia pays only 65% of the formula called the 'standard of need,' this means that a Georgia family of four can hope to receive as much as $156.95 a month. ] 10

While we sympathiyze
These men and women are where they are for reasons
These men and women are in jail or on parole because they broke the law, but many do time because they could not hire a lawyer or because the judge dislikes Black people, or the prosecutor was running for re- election. We will never know how many stole to feed a family, or cheated to fill hungry stomachs, but we do know that crime and poverty go hand in hand.

Where drugs and alcohol flow like water, where welfare policies force fathers from their homes, where the doors to jobs and promotions are closed, and where an education system turns out high school graduates who cannot read and write, then the citizens have ] 11 a right to be afraid for their lives.
That These problems too are the responsibility of our local, state and national governments, but they will be solved only to the extent you become a potent enough political force to require their solution or to remove from office those lawmakers who refuse to share the state's resources with those whose need is greatest.
If you do nothing more when you leave here and return to your homes across the state, visit your legislators and urge them to increase these benefits so that the poorest among us can at least manage to exist.
In fact, you who represent NAACP Branches in all of the towns and cities and counties of Georgia ought to see yourselves as a potent lobbying force for the poor, the disadvantaged, and the forgotten.
The NAACP is not a partisan organization, and never should ] 12 become one. It is, however, a [political] people's organization, and it needs now to apply its [abilities] strength state-wide, to tell those who represent you in the Capitol that they can't vote for poverty up there and get your votes at home too.
Georgia's ten members of Congress, one of our Senators, and Every constitutional officer in this state, from governor on down, will be elected next year.
Your political action committees ought to begin now to monitor their activities, to strengthen tighten them up when they're wrong and pat them on the back when there're right, and finally, to keep them at down home if they won't learn how to represent you.
The political process has given us the mayor of our capitol city, state legislators from across the state, and a member of congress we would still have today if some people in Atlanta hadn't learned that any fool can run, and then several did.
It can deliver much more to us, but only if we can learn to use it as others ] 13 have done.
In addition to the other problems we face, some other dangers are rising on our right.
Some old friends, and some old enemies, have joined together to mount a legal challenge to the equal opportunity and affirmative action programs that are finally beginning to provide some small compensation to the victims of a 200-year-old quota system that has guaranteed that white, Anglo-Saxon males will enjoy a monopoly on' good jobs, on class room seats in our best schools, on positions of power and prestige in government and industry - a quota system that has reserved all the good things America has to offer to those who are male and pale.
If the United States Suprse Court upholds the California court in the Bakke case, the first effect will be to lower the standard of health care available to residentsof the state of California. After all, Alan Bakke applied to 13 medical ] 14 schools, and 13 medical schools turned him down, one of them twice, and one included his alma mater which presumably knew more about his qualifications - or lack of them - to be a doctor than anyone else.
After all, t The school he Bakke sued admitted 32 white students with grade point averages lower than Alan Bakke's his, but he raised no objection at all.
After all, t The schoo the dean of the school he sued had set aside five seats for the sons and daughters of alumni, for the children of big contributors and politically important people in California, bit Alan Bakker made no objection.
Remember that Then under a special admissions program, six Blacks, eight Chicanos and 2 Asain American students were admitted, and then and only then Alan Bakke said no.
The Supreme Court of the United States that heard this argument is a perfect example of the necessity for the kinds of ] 15 programs Alan Bakke wants to destroy.
Following After 200 years of legal education in America, after 200 years of free and unfettered competition, 200 years of strict standards applied by a distinguished profession, not a single woman and only a solitary Black man have been found ""qualified"" to sit on the Supreme Court.

When your local television advertises sales of South Africa's Krugerand, let them know in no uncertain terms that you will not tolerate an advertisement for financial support for this evil system anymore than Jews would tolerate and advertisement for Hitler savings bonds. to support Nazi Germany.
We owe a real debyt to our Ambassador, Andrew Young, if only that because he is the first American Ambassador to the United Nations who knows that there is a racist dictatorship in South Agfrica. He ] 18 deserves our support, but more importantly, he deserves to know have us demand that our government stand up as strong for human rights there as it says it will anywhere else.
Finally, as the Thanksgiving season approaches, we can be thankful that we Are here, alive and able to do another' day's work.
We can be thankful too for the NAACP and for the service it has given us over these long, dark years.
The shame is that we give so little back. In spite of the sorry statistics I recited a few minutes ago, we have reached as far as we have only because of the Association.
It deserves much better from us. We have seen a lot of organizations come and go over the years. (In Atlanta, we start a new one every week.) This one was here before most of us were born, and if it takes that long, it will be here long after we are gone.
We could do ourselves a favor by having each branch increase ] 19 its membership by one-half, because that strength is our strength, and a strong people must succeed.
Let me leave you with some words from the past, from the late W. E. B. DuBois, whosaid:
""I believe in God who made of one blood all races that dwell on Earth. I believe that all men, Black and brown, and white, are brothers, varying through time and opportunity, in form and gift and feature, but differing in no essential particular, and alike in soul and in the possibility of infinite development.
Especially do I believe in the Negro race; in the beauty of its genius, the sweetness of its soul, and its strength in that meekness which shall inherit this turbulent Earth.
I believe in pride of race and lineage itself, in pride of self so deep as to scorn injustice to other selves; in pride of lineage so great as to despise no man's father, in pride of race so chivalrous as neither to offer bastardy to the weak nor beg wedlock of the strong, knowing that 
12
men many be brothers ] 20 in Christ, even though he they be no brothers-in-law.
I believe in service: humble reverent service, from the blackening of boots to the whitening of souls; for work in heaven, idleness hell, and wages is the ""well done"" of the master who summoned all them that labor and are heavy laden, making no distinction between the Black sweating cotton-hands of Georgia and the first families of Virginia, since all distinction not based on deed is devilish and not divine.
I believe in the Devil and his angels, who wantonly work to narrow the opportunity of struggling human beings, especially if they be Black; who spit in the faces of the fallen, strike them that cannot strike again, believe the wors and work to prove it, hating the image which their maker stamped on a brother's soul.
I believe in the Prince of Peace. I believe that war is murder. I believe that armies and navies are at bottom the tinsel ] 21 and braggadocio of oppression and wrong; and I believe that the wicked conquest of weaker and darker nations by nations a white and stronger but foreshadows the death of that strength.
13
I believe in liberty for all men; the space to stretch their arms and their souls: the right to breathe and the right to vote: the freedom to choose their friends, enjoy the sunshine and ride on the railroads, uncursed by color: thinking, dreaming, working as they will in the kingdom of God and love.
I believe in the training of children Black even as white; the leading out of little souls into the green pastures and beside the still waters not for pelf truth; lest we forget, and the sons of the father like Esau, for mere meat barter their birthright in a mighty nation.
Finally, I believe in patience: patience with the weakness of the weak and the strength of the strong, the prejudice of the ignorant and the ignorance of the blind; patience with the tardy triumph of joy and the chastening of sorrow: patience with God.

In 1975, 26,367 potential doctors were turned down by American medical schools. One of them was named Alan Bakke.
In a suit that has reached the United States Supreme Court, Bakke charges that he was denied admission at the University of California at Davis solely because of his race.
He charges that a special program for disadvantaged students--begun in 1970--caused the admission of sixteen minority students whose academic qualifications were less than his, and that denial violated his rights under the equal protection clause of the United States Constitution.
The University has answered this charge by arguing that only a race-conscious admissions policy can help overcome the
2
imbalance between white and non-white physicians in California and the United States.
Because non-white students, as a class, do less well on standardized tests than white students do, any admissions policy which does not consider race will result in nearly all-white student bodies in American medical schools.
When the special admissions program was begun at UC Davis in 1970, Blacks were 2. 6 of all medical school enrollments, the same proportion as in 19650, twenty years earlier, In fact, since the Black population has increased faster than the number of Black physicians, there were actually fewer Black doctors per thousand in 1970 than there were in 1948.
At the end of the 1960s, most American medical schools began special efforts to attract minority students. The need for such programs was evident.
In 1945, five years after Alan Bakke was born, the Southern
3
states where most Black people lived then were spending twice as much to educate white children as they spent for Black ones. They paid four times as much for white school plants, paid white teacher salaries 30% higher, spent $42 million dollars bussing white children to school and only $1 million for Black ones. The percentage of whites finishing high school was four times that for Blacks. The Southern states were spending $86 millions of tax dollars on white colleges and only $5 million on Black ones. There was not a single institution in the South where a Black student could receive a Ph.D.
It was not until 1968 that the number of minorities--Blacks, Native Americans, Mexican Americans, mainland Puerto Ricans--accepted into M.D. programs climbed past 200 a year. In all the years of medical education in the United States, never before had 200 students of color been admitted at any one time into the country's medical schools.
4
The increases were due to the pressures of the federal government, the availability of private funds, and the general recognition by medical school facilities--like that at Davis--that it would take more than regular admissions policies and procedures to redress the imbalance caused by 200 years of separate and unequal education in America.
Put another way, the figures become more stark. Black people are 13% of the population, but only 2.6% of the doctors. There are over five million Mexican Americans in America--only 250 of them are doctors. There are nearly a million Native Americans--only 72 are doctors. While there is one white physician for every 538 white people, for Blacks the ratio is one to every 13,888. To bring these figures in line with what they ought to be, the country would have to produce 29,000 additional Black doctors immediately. (These are comforting statistics only if you believe that white people are sicker than Black people are.)
5
It was this sorry picture--and the mounting pressure from Blacks--which led schools like Davis to set up their special programs.
The problem was to construct a program which would lead to a reversal of the discrimination that has burdened non-whites since before the Mayflower arrived, to reverse the 200-year-old quota system that has guaranteed that pale males would enjoy a monopoly on good jobs, on seats in colleges and universities, on all of the benefits the United States promises the many and delivers only to the few.
Even the golden state of California was implicated in this bigotry. Between 1866 and World War I, only one Black student graduated from the University's medical school in San Francisco. Blacks were once not even permitted to live on the campus at Davis. In other cases, the California Supreme Court which affirmed Bakke has held that the state unconstituttionally deprived minorities of an equal education. It is difficult to understand how the state, having handicapped minorities early on in their education, can
6
legally disclaim responsibility for their difficulties at a later point in their schooling.
By the time Alan Bakke was 32, he had applied to thirteen medical schools, and thirteen medical schools had turned him down. In 1972, he applied to the medical schools at the University of Southern California and Northwestern University. In 1973, he applied to the medical schools at the University of California at Los Angeles, the University of California at San Francisco, Stanford University, the University of Minnesota, Mayo, Wayne State University, Georgetown University, the University of Cincinnati, Bowman-Gray, the University of South Dakota and the University of California at Davis.
One hundred students were admitted to the first year medical class at Davis in 1973. 79 were admitted as a result of regular admissions policies. They included no Blacks, 2 Chicanos, and 13 Asian-Americans. Five white students were admitted under a
7
secret quota maintained by the Dean, and reserved for the sons and daughters of alumni and the children of big contributors and politically important people in California.
Eight of the white students admitted as part of the regular admissions program had benchmark scores lower than Alan Bakke's; 36 whites admitted that same year had lower undergraduate scores, 15 whites with higher scores than Bakke's, and 20 whites with equal benchmark scores were refused.
Minority applicants are screened to determine if they are disadvantaged by examining their means, need to work during their undergraduate career, and their parents' economic and educational background. Minority applicants with no general history of disadvantage--for example, the child of a Black Physician--are placed in the regular admissions program. The special admissions program resulted in the admission of six Blacks, eight Chicanos, and two Asians.
8
(In the first year of the special program, 1970, it admitted five Blacks and three Chicanos; the regular program admitted no Blacks and no Chicanos. In 1971, the special program admitted 15 minority students; the regular program admitted nine. In its third year, the special program admitted 16 minority students; the regular program admitted eleven. In its fourth year, the special program admitted sixteen minority students; the regular program admitted 15; in the fifth year of the program, fifteen minority students were admitted, while the regular program admitted only nine.)
Alan Bakke charges that this process is reverse discrimination, that he is the victim of an illegal quota system, and that he was discriminated against because of his race.
Reverse discrimination would exist if minorities were to brutalize, dehumanize, degrade and enslave white people, were to cause white people to take the worst jobs, to live in the least
9
attractive sections of town, to send their children to the worst schools, and to face death at an earlier age than Black people do. What Mr. Bakke calls reverse discrimination is compensatory treatment, surely not a new concept in either American education or American law.
Veterans in Georgia are given preferential treatment when they seek employment with the state. Georgia residents are given preferential treatment when they apply to our own state's medical school, even though non-residents may have better paper qualifications. In undergraduate education, such qualifications as athletic ability are used to favor some and deny others.
Additionally, the system at Davis did not constitute a quota, or according to the New Heritage Dictionary, ""the maximum number or proportion of persons who may be admitted, as to a nation, group, or institution."" In the years cited by Bakke, 1970 through 1974, only twice did the special admissions program reach its goal
10
of filling the sixteen seats it had set aside. If the special program had been a quota system, sixteen minorities would have been admitted under it each year. Further, since the special and regular program each year admitted more and less than sixteen minority students—a low of twelve in 1970 to a high of 31 in 1973—it is clear there was no ceiling on minority admissions at Davis.
Finally, there is ample Supereme Court precedent for remedial efforts taking race into consideration. The courts have long recognized that simple elimination of future discrimination is not enough to rectify what has happened in the past.
The Supreme Court held in North Carolina State Board of Education vs. Swann: ""Just as the race of the student must be considered in determing whether a constitutional violation has occurred, so also must race be considered in formulating a remedy. To forbid, at this stage, all assignments made on the basis of race would deprive school authorities of the one tool absolutely
11
essential to fulfillment of their constitutional obligation.""
It is graphically illustrated in B. Waldman, Economic and Racial Disadvantage as Reflected in Traditional Medical School Selection Factors: A Study of 1976 Applicants to U.S. Medical Schools, Association of American Medical Colleges, (1977), the GPA and MCAT (Medical College Admission Test) scores of racial/ethnic minroites as a class reflect a disadvantage which cannot be attributed to econimc status. Lower income whites do not share his disadvantage as a class. Rather, this disadvantage results from generations of slavery, segregation, and purposeful discrimination, the effects of which permeate the environment in which minority students are raised. This educational disadvantage is attributable to the poorer quality of public schools where minority students have traditionally begun their education; to the shortage of professional role models with whom aspiring minority students can identify; to a home life in which parents who have been denied opportunity
12
for education and advancement feel the hopelessness of their situation and may fail to encourage their children to prepare for higher education; and to the general lack of expectation that the minority student will attain professional status.
The same study demonstrated that MCAT and GPA scores vary only slightly according to parental income, within the same racial/ ethnic grouping. But they vary significantly according to race within the same income grouping. The study concludes that the variety of factors associated with race confers a far greater level of educational disadvantage than does lower economic status alone.1
Therefore, minority applicants to medical schools cannot failry compete with white applicants when prior educational achievement is the predominate criterion for admission.
If the 1954 Brown decision ordering an end to segregated schools had been enforced over the last 23 years, and if racial
13
discrimination in American education and employment had been eliminated, then perhaps the special admissions program at UC Davis would not be needed. But while race remains the central factor in determining life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness for 13% of the nation's population, programs like the one at Davis are not only permissible, they are in fact mandatory.
The California court's assumption that special, non-racial treatment of all disadvantaged students would remedy the disparity between the numbers of white and non-white physicians is simply not correct. Since the educational disadvantage is rooted in race, cognizance of race in the admissions process is a legitimate duty of an admissions officer or committee, is necessary to address compelling state and national interests, and is constitutional under the Equal Protection Clause.
14
The court may well ask: was Alan Bakke excluded because sixteen minority students were included? The answer is a resounding ""NO.""
In 1973, Alan Bakke was one of 26,367 unsuccessful applicants to American medical schools. That same year, the same schools admitted 1,297 minorities. If all the minority students had been rejected, there is no way Alan Bakke can insist he would not have been among the 24,070 whites still refused.
In this case, Alan Bakke has argued that he was first in a long line of candidates, ordered by merit, and suddenly 16 persons were moved ahead of him because of his color, and when he came to the front of this line again, the door was slammed shut in his face.
Should the white students admitted in 1973 whose scores were lower than Bakke's be expelled? If not, does the California court's ruling mean that whites with low paper qualifications may be
15
admitted while similary situated minorities may not?
Should the special program students whose grade point averages were higher than Bakke's be expelled, or may we agree with the Davis admissions committee that "". . . grades have not been the only concern of admissions committees in selecting students (otherwise a computer could be used to select the class), and Bakke is not necessarily more qualified for the study of medicine (or the eventual practice of medicine) merely because he has the higher undergraduate grades. . .""
To admit Alan Bakke now would overturn the unanimous conclusion of 13 admissions committees, and declare him the winner of a retroactive lottery among more than 22,000 unsuccessful applicants.
But, medical schools are not established for the purpose of giving a benefit to those lucky enough to have won a chance. They are organized to serve society by producing people trained to heal
16
the sick, care for the dying, and to promote the general health. The unspoken argument in this case is that the lower GPA and MCAT scores of some of the special admissions Students at Davis permitted unqualified students to enter the school, students who, if they graduated at all, would be medical dumbbells or butchers.
The facts do not support this argument.
The special students at Davis had MCAT scores that equal the national average in 1950. If today's student is unqualified, then surely so is every practicing physician who received his education before then.
But to suggest that the special students are unqualified to become medical students is to suggest criminal behavior on the part of admissions committees, or to suggest that minorities are racially unable to qualify for a medical school education in the United States.
One important point to remember -- there is little correlation
17
between applicant's test scores and their subsequent performance as medical students. A study of 1,088 students in fourteen classes at the University of California School of Medicine at San Francisco concluded that there is virtually no relationship between these scores and medical school grades. Other studies, moreover, have concluded that high MCAT scores do not always accurately indicate which students will be most effective in clinical situations. Comparisons between student test scores and their subsequent performance as physicians have yielded similar findings.
If test scores mean relatively little among otherwise qualified applicants, then the determining factors of acceptance must be based on the applicant's potential for fulfilling the goals of the school and society at large. Logically, minority applicants are probably better qualified to fulfill one of the most important of these goals: providing medical service to minority communities.
If minority admissions programs are characterized as giving
18
the advantage to underqualified minority applicants because of their skin color, the programs do seem to reek of ""reverse discrimination."" But try this description: ""A certain number of minority students are admitted each year because their life experience as members of minorities in this country makes them better qualified than white applicants to meet the important university goal of training doctors to work in minority neighborhoods.""2
The principle of goals and preferential treatment is well established. In Carter v. Gallagher, (452 F. 2nd, 315 8th Cin. 1971)), a federal court, finding the Minneapolis Fire Department had discriminated against minorities, ordered the department to hire one minority person of every three who qualified until at least twenty minority workers had been hired.
Similar goals have been ordered in numerous other cases, and in Rios v. Steamfitters Local 638 (501 F.2d at 631-32), the Court states: ""Affirmative action is essential . . . to place
19
eligible minority members in the position which the minority would have enjoyed if it had not been the victim of discriminaiton.""
The courts have given sanction to affirmative action based on race.

Not everyone who wants to can become a doctor in the United States today. In 1975, 26,367 potential doctors were turned down by American medical schools. One of them was named Alan Bakke.
In a suit that has reached the United States Supreme Court, Bakke charges that he was denied admission at the University of California at Davis solely because of his race. He Bakke charges that a special program for disadvantaged students--begun in 1970--caused the admission of sixteen minority students whose academic qualifications were less than his, and that denial violated his rights under the Equal Protection Clause of the United States constitution.
The University has answered this charge by arguing that only a race-conscious admissions policy can help overcome the
2
imbalance between white and non-white physicians in California and the United States.
Because non-white students, as a class, do less well on standardized tests than white students do, any admissions policy which does not consider race will result in nearly all-white student bodies in American medical schools.
When the special admissions program was begun at UC Davis in 1970, Blacks were 2. 6 of all medical school enrollments, the same proportion as in 19650, twenty years earlier, In fact, since the Black population has increased faster than the number of Black physicians, there were actually fewer Black doctors per thousand in 1970 than there were in 1948.
At the end of the 1960s, most American medical schools began special efforts to attract minority students. The need for such programs was evident.
In 1945, five years after Alan Bakke was born, the Southern
3
states where most Black people lived then were spending twice as much to educate white children as they spent for Black ones. They paid four times as much for white school plants, paid white teacher salaries 30% higher, spent $42 million dollars bussing white children to school and only $1 million for Black ones. The percentage of whites finishing high school was four times that for Blacks. The Southern states were spending $86 millions of tax dollars on white colleges and only $5 million on Black ones. There was not a single institution in the South where a Black student could receive a Ph.D.
It was not until 1968 that the number of minorities--Blacks, Native Americans, Mexican Americans, mainland Puerto Ricans-- accepted into D.D. programs climbed past 200 a year. In all the years of medical education in the United States, never before had 200 students of color been admitted at any one time into the country's medical schools.
4
The increases were due to the pressures of the federal government, the availablity of private funds, and the general recognition by medical school faculties--like that at Davis--that it would take more than regular admissions policies and procedures to redress the imbalance caused by 200 years of separate and unequal education in America.
Put another way, the figures become more stark. Black people are 13% of the population, but only 2.6% of doctors. There are over five million Mexican Americans in America--only 250 of them are doctors. There are nearly a million Native Americans--only 72 are doctors. While there is one white physician for every 538 white people, for Blacks the ratio is one to every 13,888. To bring these figures in line with what they ought to be, the country would have to produce 29,000 additional Black doctors immediately. (These are comforting statistics only if you belief that white people are sicker than Black people are.)
5
It was this sorry picture--and the mounting pressure from Blacks--which led schools like Davis to set up their special programs.
The problem at Davis was to construct a program which would lead to a reversal of the discrimination that has burdened non-whites since before the Mayflower arrived, to reverse the 200-year-old quota system that has guaranteed that pale males would enjoy a monopoly on good jobs, on seats in colleges and universities, on all of the benefits the United States promises the many and delivers only to the few.
Even the golden state of California was implicated in this bigotry. Between 1866 and World War I, only one Black student graduated from the University's medical school in San Francisco. Blacks were once not even permitted to live on the campus at Davis. In other cases, the California Supreme Court which affirmed Bakke has held that the state unconstitutionally deprived minorities of an equal education. It is difficult to understand how the state, having handicapped minorities early on in their education, can
6
legally disclaim responsibility for their difficulties at a later point in their schooling.
By the time Alan Bakke was 32, he had applied to thirteen medical schools, and thirteen medical had turned him down. In 1972, he applied to the medical school at the University of Southern California and Northwestern University. In 1973, he applied to medical schools at the University of California at Los Angeles, the University of California at San Francisco, Stanford University, the University of Minnesota, Mayo Wayne State University, Georgetown University, the University of Cincinnati, Bowman-Gray, University of South Dakota and the University of California at Davis.
One hundred students were admitted to the first year medical class at Davis in 1973. 79 were admitted as a result of regular admissions policies. They included no Blacks, 2 Chicanos, and 13 Asian-Americans. Five white students were admitted under a
7
secret quota maintained by the Dean, and reserved for the sons and daughters of alumni and the children of big contributors and politically important people in California.
Eight of the white students admitted as part of the regular admissions program had benchmark scores lower than Alan Bakke's; 36 whites admitted that same year had lower undergraduate scores, 15 whites with higher scores than Bakke's, and 20 whites with equal benchmark scores were refused.
Minority applicants are screened to determine if they are disadvantaged by examining their means, need to work during their undergraduate career, and their parents' economic and educational background. Minority applicants with no general history of disadvantage--for example, the child of a Black physican--are placed in the regular admissions program. The special admissions program resulted in the admission of six Blacks, eight Chicanos, and two Asians.
8
(In the first year of the special program, 1970, it admitted five Blacks and three Chicanos; the regular program admitted no Blacks and no Chicanos. In 1971, the special program admitted 15 minority students; the regular program admitted nine. In its third year, the special program admitted 16 minority students; the regular program admitted eleven. In its fourth year, the special program admitted sixteen minority students; the regular program admitted 15; in the fifth year of the program, fifteen minority students were admitted, while the regular program admitted only nine.)
Alan Bakke charges that this process is reverse discrimination, that he is the victim of an illegal quota system, and that he was discriminated against because of his race.
Reverse discrimination would exist if minorities were to brutalize, dehumanize, degrade and enslave white people, were to cause white people to take the worst jobs, to live in the least
9
attractive sections of town, to send their children to the worst schools, and to face death at an earlier age than Black people do. What Mr. Bakke calls reverse discrimination is compensatory treatment, surely not a new concept in either American education or American law.
Veterans in Georgia are given preferential treatment when they seek employment with the state. Georgia residents are given preferential treatment when they apply to our own state's medical school, even though non-residents may have better paper qualifications. In undergraduate education, such qualifications as athletic ability are used to favor some and deny others.
Additionally, the system at Davis did not constitute a quota, or according to the New Heritage Dictionary, ""the maximum number or proportion of persons who may be admitted, as to a nation, group, or institution."" In the years cited by Bakke, 1970 through 1974, only twice did the special admissions program reach its goal
10
of filling the sixteen seats it had set aside. If the special program had been a quota system, sixteen minorities would have been admitted under it each year. Further, since the special and regular program each year admitted more and less than sixteen minority students--a low of twelve in 1970 to a high of 31 in 1973--it is clear there was no ceiling on minority admissions at Davis.
Finally, there is ample Supereme Court precedent for remedial efforts taking race into consideration. The courts have long recognized that simple elimination of future discrimination is not enough to rectify what has happened in the past.
The Supreme Court held in North Carolina State Board of Education vs. Swann: ""Just as the race of the student must be considered in determing whether a constitutional violation has occurred, so also must race be considered in formulating a remedy. To forbid, at this stage, all assignments made on the basis of race would deprive school authorities of the one tool absolutely
11
essential to fulfillment of their constitutional obligation.""
It is graphically illustrated in B. Waldman, Ecomonic and Racial Disadvantage as Reflected in Traditional Medical School Selection Factors: A Study of 1976 Applicants to U.S. Medical Schools, Association of American Medical Colleges, (1977), the GPA and MCAT (Medical College Admission Test) scores of racial/ ethnic minroites as a class reflect a disadvantage which cannot be attributed to econimc status. Lower income whites do not share this disadvantage as a class. Rather, this disadvantage results from generations of slavery, segregation, and purposeful discrimination, the effects of which permeate the environment in which minority students are raised. This educational disadvantage is attributable to the poorer quality of public schools where minority students have traditionally begun their education to the shortage of professional role models with whom aspiring minority students can identify; to a home life in which parents who have been denied opportunity
12
for education and advancement feel the hopelessness of their situation and may fail to encourage their children to prepare for higher education; and to the general lack of expectation that the minority student will attain professional status.
The same study demonstrated that MCAT and GPA scores vary only slightly according to parental income, within the same racial/ ethnic grouping. But they vary significantly according to race within the same income grouping. The study concludes that the variety of factors associated with race confers a far greater level of educational disadvantage than does lower economic status alone.1
Therefore, minority applicants to medical schools cannot failry compete with white applicants when prior educational achievement is the predominate criterion for admission.
If the 1954 Brown decision ordering an end to segregated schools had been enforced over the last 23 years, and if racial
13
discrimination in American education and employment had been eliminated, then perhaps the special admissions program at UC Davis would not be needed. But while race remains the central factor in determining life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness for 13% of the nation's population, programs like the one at Davis are not only permissible, they are in fact mandatory.
The California court's assumption that special, non-racial treatment of all disadvantaged students would remedy the disparity between the numbers of white and non-white physicians is simply not correct. Since the educational disadvantage is rooted in race, cognizance of race in the admissions process is a legitimate duty of an admissions officer or committee, is necessary to address compelling state and national interests, and is constitutional under the Equal Protection Clause.
14
The court may well ask: was Alan Bakke excluded because sixteen minority students were included? The answer is a resounding ""No.""
In 1973, Alan Bakke was one of 26,367 unsuccessful applicants to American medical schools. That same year, the same schools admitted 1,297 minorities. If all the minority students had been rejected, there is no way Alan Bakke can insist he would not have been among the 24,070 still refused.
In this case, Alan Bakke has argued that he was first in a long line of candidates, ordered by merit, and suddenly 16 persons were moved ahead of him because of his color, and when he came to the front of this line again, the door was slammed shut in his face.
Should the white students admitted in 1973 whose scores were lower than Bakke's be expelled? If not, does the California court's ruling mean that whites with low paper qualifications may be
15
admitted while similary situated minorities may not?
Should the special program students whose grade point averages were higher than Bakke's be expelled, or may we agree with the Davis admissions committee that ""... grades have not been the only concern of admissions committees in selecting students (otherwise a computer could be used to select the class), and Bakke is not necessarily more qualified for the study of medicine (or the eventual practice of medicine) merely because he has the higher undergraduate grades...""
To admit Alan Bakke now would overturn unanimous conclusion of 13 admissions committees, and declare him the winner of a retroactive lottery among more than 22,000 unsuccessful applicants.
But, medical schools are not established for the purpose of giving a benefit to those lucky enough to have won a chance. They are organized to serve society by producing people trained to heal
16
the sick, care for the dying, and to promote the general health. The unspoken argument in this case is that the lower GPA and MCAT scores of some of the special admissions students at Davis permitted unqualified students to enter the school, students who, if they graduated at all, would be medical dumbbells or butchers.
The facts do not support this argument.
The special students at Davis had MCAT scores that equal the national average in 1950. If today's student is unqualified, then surely so is every practicing physician who received his education before then.
But to suggest that the special students are unqualified to become medical students is to suggest criminal behavior on the part of admissions committees, or to suggest that minorities are racially unable to qualify for a medical school education in the United States.
One important point to remember--there is little correlation
17
between applicant's test scores and their subsequent performance as medical students. A study of 1,088 students in fourteen classes at the University of California School of Medicine at San Francisco concluded that there is virtually no relationship between these scores and medical school grades. Other studies, moreover, have concluded that high MCAT scores do not always accurately indicate which students will be most effective in clinical situations. Comparison between student test scores and their subsequent performance as physicians have yielded similar findings.
If test scores mean relatively little among otherwise qualified applicants, then the determining factors of acceptance must be based on the applicant's potential for fulfilling the goals of the school and society at large. Logically, minority applicants are probably better qualified to fulfill one of the most important of these goals: providing medical service to minority communities,
If minority admissions programs are characterized as giving
18
the advantage to underqualified minority applicants because of their skin color, the programs do seem to reek of ""reverse discrimination."" But, try this description: ""A certain number of minority students are admitted each year because their life experience as members of minorities in this country makes them better qualified than white applicants to meet the important university goal of training doctors to work in minority neighborhoods.""2
The principal of goals and preferential treatment is well established. In Carter v. Gallagher, (452 F.2nd, 315 8th Cin.1971)), a federal court, finding the Minneapolis Fire Department had discriminated against minorities, ordered the department to hire one minority person of every three who qualified until at least twenty minority workers had been hired.
Similar goals have been ordered in numerous other cases, and in Rios v. Steamfitters Local 638 (501 F.2d at 631-32), the Court states: ""Affirmative action is essential ... to place
19
eligible minority members in the position which the minority would have enjoyed if it had not been the victim of discrimination.""
The courts have given sanction to affirmative action based on race. Society demands that the differences in education, income, and life chances between the majority and the minority be diminished and eliminated, and where these inequities are created by race, the courts permit race to be used as a standard in developing the remedy.
To ask that these programs be destroyed is to ask minority Americans to voluntarily accept a position as a permanent underclass, never able to stand equally with their fellow Americans.
The legacy of 300 years of slavery, segregation and then discrimination is not ended overnight.
Affirmative action must be pursued if we are ever to be a nation with liberty and justice for all.

In 1975, 26,367 potential doctors were turned down by American medical schools. One of them was named Alan Bakke.
In a suit that has reached the United States Supreme Court, Bakke charges that he was denied admission at the University of California at Davis solely because of his race.
He charges that a special program for disadvantaged students--begun in 1970--caused the admission of sixteen minority students whose academic qualifications were less than his, and that denial violated his rights under the Equal Protection Clause of the United States Constitution.
The University has answered this charge by arguing that only a race-conscious admissions policy can help overcome the
2
imbalance between white and non-white physicians in California and the United States.
Because non-white students, as a class, do less well on standardized tests than white students do, any admissions which does not consider race will result in nearly all-white student bodies in American medical schools.
When the special admissions program was begun at UC Davis in 1970, Blacks were 2. 6 of all medical school enrollments, the same proportion as in 19650, twenty years earlier, In fact, since the Black population has increased faster than the number of Black physicians, there were actually fewer Black doctors per thousand in 1970 than there were in 1948.
At the end of the 1960s, most American medical schools began special efforts to attract minority students. The need for such programs was evident.
In 1945, five years after Alan Bakke was born, the Southern
3
states where most Black people lived were spending twice as much to educate white children as they spent for Black ones. They paid four times as much for white school plants, paid white teacher salaries 30% higher, spent $43 million dollars bussing white children to school and only $1 million for Black ones. The percentage of whites finishing high school was four times that for Blacks. The Southern states were spending $86 millions of tax dollars on white colleges and only $5 million on Black ones. There was not a single institution in the South where a Black student could receive a Ph.D.
It was not until 1968 that the number of minorities--Blacks, Native American, Mexican Americans, mainland Puerto Ricans-- accepted into M.D. programs climbed past 200 a year. In all the years of medical education in the United States, never before had 200 students of color been admitted at any one time into the country's medical schools.
[Three lines of correction tape appear at the bottom of this page.]
4
The increases were due to the pressures of the federal government, the availability of private funds, and the general recognition by medical school faculties--like that at Davis--that it would take more than regular admissions policies and procedures to redress the imbalance caused by 200 years of separate and unequal education in America.
Put another way, the figures become more stark. Black people are 13% of the population, but only 2.6% of the doctors. There are over five million Mexican Americans in America--only 250 of them are doctors. There are nearly a million Native Americans-only 72 are doctors. While there is one white physician for every 538 white people, for Blacks the ratio is one to every 13,888. To bring these figures in line with what they ought to be, the country would have to produce 29,000 additional Black doctors immediately. (These are comforting statistics only if you believe that white people are sicker than Black people are.)
5
It was this sorry picture--and the mounting pressure from Blacks--which led schools like Davis to set up their special programs.
The problem was to construct a program which would lead to a reversal of the discrimination that has burdened non-whites since before the Mayflower arrived, to reverse the 200-year-old quota system that has guaranteed that pale males would enjoy a monopoly of good jobs, on seats in colleges and universities, on all of the benefits the United States promises the many and delivers only to the few.
Even the golden state of California was implicated in this history. Between 1866 and World War I, only one Black student graduated from the University's medical school in San Francisco. Blacks were once not even permitted to live on the campus at Davis. In other cases, the California Supreme Court which affirmed Bakke has held that the state unconstitutionally deprived minorities of an equal education. It is difficult to understand how the state, having handicapped minorities early on in their education, can
6
legally disclaim responsibility for their difficulties at a later point in their schooling.
By the time Alan Bakke was 32, he had appled to thirteen medical schools, and thirteen medical schools had turned him down. In 1972, he applied to the medical schools at the University of Southern California and Northwestern University. In 1973, he applied to the medical schools at the University of California at Los Angeles, the University of California at San Francisco, Stanford University, the University of Minnesota, Mayo, Wayne State University, Georgetown University, the University of Cincinnati, Bowan-Gray, the University of South Dakota and the University of California at Davis.
One hundred students were admitted to the first year medical class at Davis in 1973. 79 were admitted as result of regular admission policies. They included no Blacks, 2 Chicanos and 12 Asian-American. Five students were admitted under a
7
secret quota maintained by the Dean, and reserved for the sons and daughters of alumni and the children of big contributors and politically important people in California.
Eight of the white students admitted as part of the regular admissions program had benchmark scores lower than Alan Bakke's; 36 whites admitted that same year had lower undergraduate scores. 15 whites with higher scores than Bakke's, and 20 whites with equal benchmark scores were refused.
Minority applicants are screened to determine if they are disadvantaged by examining their means, need to work during their undergraduate career, and their parents' economic and educational background. Minority applicants with no general history of disadvantage--for example, the child of a Black physician--are placed in the regular admissions program. The special admissions program resulted in the admission of six Blacks, eight Chicanos, and two Asians.
8
(In the first year of the special program, 1970, it admitted five Blacks and three Chicanos; the regular program admitted no Blacks and no Chicanos. In 1971, the special program admitted 15 minority students; the regular program admitted nine. In its third year, the special program admitted 16 minority students; the regular program admitted eleven. In its fourth year, the special program admitted sixteen minority students; the regular program admitted 15; in the fifth year of the program, fifteen minority student were admitted, while the regular program admitted only nine.)
Alan Bakke charges that this process is reverse discrimination, that he is the victim of an illegal quota system, and that he was discriminated against because of his race.
Reverse discrimination would exist if minorities were to brutalize, dehumanize, degrade and enslave white people, were to cause white people to take the worst jobs, to live in the least
9
attractive sections of town, to send their children to the worst schools, and to face death at an earlier age than Black people do. What Mr. Bakke calls reverse discrimination is compensatory treatment, surely not a new concept in either American education or American law.
Veterans in Georgia are given preferential treatment when they seek employment with the state. Georgia residents are given preferential treatment when they apply to our own state's medical school, even though non-residents may have better paper qualifications. In undergraduate education, such qualifications as athletic ability are used to favor some and deny others.
Additionally, the system at Davis did not constitute a quota, or according to the New Heritage Dictionary, ""the maximum number or proportion of persons who may be admitted, as to a nation, group, or institution."" In the years cited by Bakke, 1970 through 1974, only twice did the special admissions program reach its goal
10
of filling the sixteen seats it had set aside. If the special program had been a quota system, sixteen minorities would have been admitted under it each year. Further, since the special and regular program each year admitted more and less than sixteen minority students--a low of twelve in 1970 to a high of 31 in 1973--it is clear there was no ceiling on minority admissions at Davis.
Finally, there is ample Superme Court precedent for remedial efforts taking race into consideration. The courts have long recognized that simple elimination of future discrimination is not enough to rectify what has happened in the past.
The Supreme Court held in North Carolina State Board of Education vs. Swann: ""just as the race of the student must be considered in determing whether a constitutional violation has occurred, so also must race be considered in formulating a remedy. To forbid, at this stage, all assignments made on the basis of race would deprive school authorities of the one tool absolutely
11
essential to fulfillment of their constitutional obligation.""
It is graphically illustrated in B. Waldman, Economic and Racial Disadvantage as Reflected in Traditional Medical School Selection Factors: A Study of 1976 Applicants to U.S. Medical Schools, Association of American Medical Colleges, (1977), the GPA and MCAT (Medical College Admission Test) scores of racial/ ethnic minroites as a class reflect a disadvantage which cannot be attributed to econimc status. Lower income whites do not share his disadvantage as a class. Rather, this disadvantage results from generations of slavery, segregation, and purposeful discrimination, the effects of which permeate the environment in which minority students are raised. This educational disadvantage is attributable to the poorer quality of public schools where minority students have traditionally begun their education; to the shortage of professional role models with whom aspiring minority students can identify; to a home life in which parents who have been denied opportunity
12
for education and advancement feel the hopelessness of their situation and may fail to encourage their children to prepare for higher education; and to the general lack of expectation that the minority student will attain professional status.
The same study demonstrated that MCAT and GPA scores vary only slightly according to parental income, within the same racial/ ethnic grouping. But they vary significantly according to race within the same income grouping. The study concludes that the variety of factors associated with race confers a far greater level of educational disadvantage than does lower economic status alone.1
Therefore, minority applicants to medical school cannot failry compete with white applicants when prior educational achievement is the predominate criterion for admission.
If the 1954 Brown decision ordering an end to segregated schools had been enforced over the last 23 years, and if racial
13
discrimination in American education and employment had been eliminated, then perhaps the special admissions program at UC Davis would not be needed. But while race remains the central factor in determining life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness for 13% of the nation's population, programs like the one at Davis are not only permissible, they are in fact mandatory.
The California court's assumption that special, non-racial treatment of all disadvantaged students woud remedy the disparity between the numbers of white and non-white physicians is simply not correct. Since the educational disadvantage is rooted in race, cognizance of race in the admissions process is a legitimate duty of an admissions officer or committee, is necessary to address compelling state and national interests, and is constitutional under the Equal Protection Clause.
[One line at the bottom of this page is covered in correction fluid.]
14
The court may well ask: was Alan Bakke excluded because sixteen minority students were included? The answer is a resounding ""No.""
In 1973, Alan Bakke was one of 26,367 unsuccessful applicants to American medical schools. That same year, the same schools admitted 1,297 minorities. If all the minority students had been rejected, there is no way Alan Bakke can insist he would not have been among the 24,070 whites still refused.
In this case, Alan Bakke has argued that he was first in a long line of candidates, ordered by merit, and suddenly 16 persons were moved ahead of him because of his color, and when he came to the front of this line again, the door was slammed shut in his face.
Should the white students admitted in 1973 whose scores were lower than Bakke's be expelled? If not, does the California court's ruling mean that whites with low paper qualifications may be
15
admitted while similary situated minorities may not?
Should the special program students whose grade point averages were higher than Bakke's be expelled, or may we agree with the Davis admissions committee that ""...grades have not been the only concern of admissions committees in selecting students (otherwise a computer could be used to select the class), and Bakke is not necessarily more qualified for the study of medicine (or the eventual practice of medicine) merely because he has the higher undergraduate grades...""
To admit Alan Bakke now would overturn the unanimous conclusion of 13 admissions committees, and declare him the winner of a retroactive lottery among more than 22,000 unsuccessful applicants.
But, medical schools are not established for the purpose of giving a benefit to those lucky enough to have won a chance. They are organized to serve society by producing people trained to heal
16
the sick, care for the dying, and to promote the general health. The unspoken argument in this case is that the lower GPA and MCAT scores of some of the special admissions students at Davis permitted unqualified students to enter the school, students who, if they graduated at all, would be medical dumbbells or butchers.
The facts do not support this argument.
The special students at Davis had MCAT scores that equal the national average in 1950. If today's student is unqualified, then surely so is every practicing physician who received his education before then.
But to suggest that the special students are unqualified to become medical students is to suggest criminal behavior on the part of admissions committees, or to suggest that minorities are racially unable to qualify for a medical school education in the United States.
One important point to remember--there is little correlation
17
between applicant's test scores and their subsequent performance as medical students. A study of 1,088 students in fourteen classes at the University of California School of Medicine at San Francisco concluded that there is virtually no relationship between these scores and medical school grades. Other studies, moreover, have concluded that high MCAT scores do not always accurately indicate which students will be most effective in clinical situations. Comparisons between student test scores and their subsequent performance as physicians have yielded similar findings.
If test scores mean relatively little among otherwise qualified applicants, then the determining factors of acceptance must be based on the applicant's potential for fulfilling the goals of the school and society at large. Logically, minority applicants are probably better qualified to fulfill one of the most important of these goals: providing medical service to minority communities.
If minority admissions programs are characterized as giving
18
the advantage to underqualified minority applicants because of their skin color, the programs do seem to reek of ""reverse discrimination."" But, try this description: ""A certain number of minority students are admitted each year because their life experience as members of minorities in this country makes them better qualified than white applicants to meet the important university goal of training doctors to work in minority neighborhoods.""2
The principle of goals and preferential treatment is well established. In Carter v. Gallagher (452 F.2nd, 315 8th Cin.1971)), a federal court, finding the Minneapolis Fire Department had discriminated against minorities, ordered the department to hire one minority person of every three who qualified until at least twenty minority workers had been hired. [The last sentence is typed over three lines of correction tape.]
Similar goals have been ordered in numerous other cases, and in Rios v. Steamfitters Local 638 (501 F.2d at 631-32), the Court states: ""Affirmative action is essential...to place
19
eligible minority members in the position which the minority would have enjoyed if it had not been the victim of discrimination.""
The courts have given sanction to affirmative action based on race. Society demands that the difference in education, income, and life chances between the majority and the minority be diminished and eliminated, and where these inequities are created by race, the courts permit race to be used as a standard in developing the remedy.
To ask that these programs be destroyed is to ask minority Americans to voluntarily accept a position as a permanent underclass, never able to stand equally with their fellow Americans.
The legacy of 300 years of slavery, segregation and then discrimination is not ended overnight.
Affirmative action must be pursued if we are ever to be a nation with liberty and justice for all.
20
The special admissions students who were admitted in 1973--when Bakke was refused--demonstrate clearly that their race alone was no qualification, and that the standardized test which normally would have kept them out of medical school were no test at all of their ability to become doctors.
Ovel Knight graduated this year. He received his class' highest honor, the Senior Class Award. He was a special admissions student.
Only one student in the whole class of 100 earned both a medical degree and a master's degree in public health--he was Pat Harris, a Black student, one of five children in a family that lived on $3,000. a year of federal assistance, who completed four years of college in three, and graduated from Davis in the top of his class, as did each of the five Black special admissions students who graduated in 1977.
21
One dropped out, but almost none would have ever been admitted if grade point average had been allowed to determine their qualifications.
Ovel Knight, the senior Class Award Winner, is now an intern in obstetrics and gynecology at the University of Southern California Medical Center. He has co-authored a paper in the Journal of Vascular Surgery and earlier this month summed it all up when he said:
""Bakke says he's more qualified than the minority students are on grade points and test scores, and maybe he is. He's probably more qualified than half the whites in our class. But that's not the point--if admissions were based on grade point averages, med school could turn out very intelligent medical computers. But they wouldn't be doctors.""

Not everyone who wants to can become a doctor oin the United States today.
In 19735, 26,367 potential doctors were turned down by American medical schools. One of them was named Alan Bakke.
In a suit that has reached the United States Supreme Court, Bakke charges that he was denied admission at the University of California at Davis solely because of his race.
He charges that a special program for disadvantaged students - begun in 1970 - caused the admission of 16 minority students whose academic grade point qualifications were less than his, and that denial violated his rights under the equal protection clause of the United States Constitution.
The university has answered this charge by arguing that only a race-conscious admissions policy can help overcome the imbalance between white and non-white physicians in California and the United States.
Because non-white students, as a class, do less well on standardized tests that white students do, any admissions policy which does not consider race will result in nearly all-white student bodies in American medical schools.
When the special admissions program was begun at UC Davis in 1970, Blacks were 2.66% of all medical school enrollments, and the same proportion as in 1950, twenty years earlier. In fact, since the Black population has increased faster than the number of Black physicians, there were actually fewer Black doctors per thousand in 1970 than there were in 1948.

The southern states were spending $86 millions of tax dollars on white colleges and only $5 million on Black ones. There was not a single institution in the South where a Black stiudent could receive a PH. D.

In its third year, the special program admitted 16 minority students; the regular program admitted 11. In its fourth year, the special program admitted 16 minority students; the regular program admitted 15; in the fifth year of the program, 15 minority students were admitted, while the regular program admitted only 9.)
page 3 Eight of the white students admitted as part of the regular admissions program had benchmark scores lower than Alan Bakke's'; 36 whites admitted the same year had lower undergraduate scores. 15 whites with higher scores than Bakke's, and 20 whites with equal benchmarks scores were refused.
Alana Bakke charges that this process is reverse discrimination, that he is the victim of an illegal quota system, and that he was discriminated against because of his race.
Reverse discrimination would exist if minorities were [illegible] to brutalize, dehumanize, degrade and enslave white people, were to cause white people to takwe the worst jobs, to live in the least ] 9 attractive sections of town, and to send their children to the worst schools, and to face death at an earlier age than Black people do. What Mr. Bakke calls reverse discrimination is compensatory treatment, surely not a new concept in either American education or American law.
Veterans in Georgia are given preferential treatment when they seek employment with the state. Georgia residents are given preferential treatment when they apply to our own state's medical school, even thpough non-residents may have better paper qualifications. In undergraduate education, such qualifications as atheletic ability are used to favor some and deny others.
Additionally, the system used at Davis did not constitute a quota, or according to the New Heritage Dictionary, ""the maximum number of or proportion of persons who may be admitted, as to a nation, group or institution."" In the years cited by Bakke, 1970 through 1974, only twice did the special admissions program reach its goal ] 10 of filling the 16 seats it had set aside. If the special progeam
5
had been a quota system,16 minorities would have been admitted under it each year. Further, since the special and regular program each year admitted more and less than 16 minority students - a low of 12 in 1970 to a high of 31 in 1973 - it is clear there [illegible] was no ceiling on minority admissions at Davis.
Finally, there is ample Supreme Court precedent for remedial efforts taking race into consideration. The courts have long recognized that simple elimination of future discrimination is not enough to rectify what has happened in the past.
The Supreme Court held in North Carolina State Board of Education vs. Swann:
- just as the race of the student must be considered in determining whether a Constitutional violation has occurred, so also must race be considered in formulating a remedy. To forbid, at this stage, all assignments made on the basis of race would deprive school authorities of the one tool absolutley ] 11 essential to fulfilment of their constitutional obligation.""

It is graphically illustrated in B. Waldman, Economic and Racial Disadvantage as Reflected in Traditional Medical School Selection Factors: A Study i of 1976 Applicants to U. S. Medical Schbols, Association of American Medical Colleges, (1977), the gpa and Medical College Admission Test (MCAT) (Medical College Admission Test) scores of racial/ethnic minorities as a class reflect a disadvantage which cannot be attribited to economic status. Lower income whites do not share this disadvantage as a class . Rather, this disadvantage results from generations of slavery, segregation, and purposeful discrimination, the effects of whiceh permeate the environment in which minority students are raised. This educational disadvantage is attributable to the poorer quality of public schools where minority students have traditionally begun their education; to the shortage of professional role models with whom aspiring minority students can identify; to a home life in which parents who have been dnied opportunity ] 12 for education and advancement feel the hopelessness of their situation and may fail to encourage their children to prepare for higher education; and to the general lack of expectation that the minority student will attain professional status.
Medical school studies indicate that while traditional criteria (GPAs, MCAT scores) have some predictive value for minority
The same study demonstrated that MCAT and GPA scores vary only slightly according to parental income, within the same racial/ethnic grouping. But they vary siginficantly according to race within the same income grouping, The study concludes that the variety of factors associated with race confers a far greater level of educational disadvantage than doeslower economic status alone.1

[The content on this page is stapled on.]
Therefore, Mminority applicante to medical schools cannot fairly compete with white applicants when prior educational achivement is the predominate criterion for admission. Minority student grade point average and MCAT scores reflect a level of educational disdvantage which cannot be attributed to economic disadvantage alone. Lower - whites do not share this disadvantage as a class. [The following notation is crossed out in the left margin with an arrow toward the preceding paragraph.] retain
If the 1954 Brown decision ordering an end to segregated schools had been enforced over the last 23 years, and if racial ] 13 discrimination in American education and employment had been eliminated, then perhaps the special admissions program at UC Davis would not be needed. But while race remains the central factor in determining life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness for 13% of the nation's population, the programs like the one at Davis are not only permissible, they are in fact mandatory.
The California court's assumption that special, non-racial treatment of all disadvantaged students would remedy the disparity between the numbers of white and non-white physicians is simply not correct.
Since the educational disadvantage is rooted in race, cognizance of race in the admissions process is a legitimate duty of an admissions officer or committee, is necessary to address compelling state and national interests, and is constitutional under the Equal Protection Clause.
The court may well ask: was Alan Bakke excluded because 16 minorities were included? The answer is a resounding no!
In 1973, Alan Bakke was one of 26, 367 unsuccessful applicants to American medical schools. That same year, the same schools admitted 1,297 minorities. If all the minority students had been rejected, there is no way Alan Bakke can insist he would not have been among the [96]
6 7 
24,070 still refused.
In this case, Alan Bakke has argued that he was first is an long line of candidates, ordered by merit, and suddenly 16 persons were moved ahead of him because of his color, and when he came to the front of this line again, the door was slammed shut in his face.
insert [Handwritten arrows in the margin connect the notation with the following three paragraphs,  stapled and folded to the bottom of the page. See images.] 
insertShould the white student admitted in 1973 whose scores were lower than Bakke's be expelled? If not, does the California court's ruling mean that whites with low paper qualifications may be ] 15 admitted while similarly situated Blacks minorities may not?
Should the minority special program students whose grade point averages were higher than Bakke's be expelled, or may we agree with the Davis admissions committee that stated: "" ...grades have not been the only concern of admissions committees in selecting students (otherwise a computer could be used to select the class ) , and Bakke is not necessarily more qualified for the study of medeicine (or the eventual practice of medeicine) merely because he has the higher undergraduate grades...""
To admit Alana Bakke now would overturn the unanimous conclusion of 13 admissions committees, and declare him the winner of a retroactive lottery from in which of among more than 22,000 unsuccessful applicants. 
But medical schools are not established for the purpose of giving a benefit to those lucky enough to have won a chance. They are organized to serve society by producing people trained to heal ] 16 the sick, care for the dying, and to promote the general health. The unspoken argument in this cast is that the lower GPA and MCAT s test scores of some of the special admissions students at Davis permitted ungualified students to enter the school, students who if they graduated at all would be medical dumbells or butchers.
The facts do not support this argument.
The special students at Davis had MCAT scores that equal the national average in 1950. If today's student is unqualified, then surely so ifs every practicing physician who received his education before then.
The retention rates for minority students in medical schools is nearly as high as the rate for whites. 
But to suggest that the special students are unqualified to become medical students is to suggest criminal behavior on the part of admissions committees, or to suggest that minorities are racially unable to qualify for a medical school education in the United States.
insert 8- A [The following three paragraphs are the intended inserted content.] 8-A insert page 7 One important point to remember - "" there is little correlation ] 17 between applicant's test scores and their subsequent performance as medical students. A study of 1,088 students at in 14 classes at the University of California School of Medicine at San Francisco concluded that there is virtually no relationship between these scores and medical school grades. Other studies, moreover, have concluded that high MCAT scores do not always accurately indicate which students will be most effective in clinival situations. Comparisons between student test scores and their subsequent performance as physicians have yeilded similar findings.
If test scores mean relatively little among otherwise qualified applicants, then the determining factors of acceptance must be based on the applicants's potential for fulfilling the goals of the schools and society at large. Logically, minority applicants are probably better qualified to fulfill one of the most important of these goals; providing medical service to minority communities.
If minority admissions programs are characterized as giving ] 18 the advantage to underqualified minority applicants because of their skin color, the programs do seem to reek of ""reverse discrimination."" But try this description: ""A certain number of minority students are admitted each year because their life experience as members of minorities in this country makes them better qualified than white applicants to meet the important university goals of trainig doctors to work in minority neighborhoods."" 2 
The principle of goals and preferential treatment is will established. In Carter v. Gallagher, 452 F. 2d. 315 8th Cin. (1971), a federal court, finding the Minneapolis Fire Department had discriminated against minorities, ordered the department to hire one minority person of every three who qualified until at least 20 minority workers had been hired.
8
Similar goals have been ordered in numerous other cases, and in Rios v. Steamfitters Local 638, 501 F. 2d at 631 - 32, the Court stated:
""Affirmative action is essential .…to place ] 19 eligible minority members in the position which the minority would have enjoyed if it had not been the victim of discrimination.""
The courts have given sanction to affirmative action based on race. Society demands that the differences in education, income and life chances between the majority and the minority be diminished and eliminated, and where these inequities are created by race a the courts permit race to be used as a standard in developing the remedy.
To ask that these programs be destroyed is to ask minority americans to voluntarily accept a position as a permanent underclass, never able to stand equally with their fellow Americans.
The legacy of [1]300 years of slavery, segregation and then discrimination is not ended overnight.
Affirmative action must be persued if we are ever to be a nation with liberty and justice for all.

The special admissions students who were admitted in 1973 - when Bakke was refused - demonstrate clearly that their race alone was no qualification, and that the standardized tests which normally would have kept them out of medical school were no test at all of their ability to become doctors.
Ovel Knight graduated this year. He received his class highest honor, the Senior Class Award. He was a special admissions student.
Only one student in the whole class of 100 earned both a medical degree and a master's degree in public health - he was Pat Harris, a Black student, one of five children in a family that lived on $3,000.00 a year of federal aid assistance, completed four years of college in three, and graduated from Davis in the
2 10
top of his class, as did each of the five Black special admissions students who graduated in 1977. ] 21
One dropped out, but almost none - Black, Brown, would have ever been admitted if grades point averages had been allowed to determine their qualifications.
Ovel Knight, the Senior Class Award winner, is now an intern in obstretrics and gynecology at the University of Southern California Medical Center. He has co-authored a paper in the Journal of Vascular Surgery and earlier this month summed it all up when he said:
""Bakke says he's more qualified than the minority students are on grade points and test scores, and maybe his he is. He's probably more
3 11
qualified than half the white,s B in our class. But that's not the point - if admissions were based on grade point averages, med schools could turn out very intelligent medical computers. But they wouldn't be doctors.""

AN URGENT MESSAGE FROM JULIAN BOND
Dear Friend:
We are in the midst of one of the most important presidential campaigns in America's history. The democratic nominee for the presidency will have a good chance to defeat President Ford in November and that nominee will be chosen at the Democratic National Convention. While there will be people there from all over the country looking out for their own interests and the interests of their sponsors, who's looking out for you?
On May 4, you will have a chance to make two choices . You will be able to cast your vote for the presidential candidate of your choice and you will have a chance to vote for delegates to go to the convention. No matter what you've heard, no candidate will go to the convention with enough delegates to win. These delegates will cast their votes for the candidates to whom they have pledged on the first ballot only. It is after the first ballot that the serious business of the convention begins and it is at that point that you need to have delegates there who have proven their commitment to you.
We must have Democratic delegates who have proven that they are willing to fight for the rights of minorities, women, poor people and the millions of Americans who have suffered under the callous reign of the Republican administrations of Richard Nixon and Gerald Ford. I am asking you to help me and other people that I trust and support fully for delegate positions.
My opponent, Mr. Herb Mabry, is the long time head of the Building and Trades Council and will, of course, be representing their interests at the convention. I intend to go to the convention pledged to the interest of poor people, black people and other minorities who will not have a powerful voice on the convention floor.
I am also supporting the candidacy of Ms. Janet Douglass (Punch 50) and Atlanta City Councilman James Bond (Punch 39) my brother, who has worked with me on programs over the years. Ms. Douglass is a professional educator and community worker who has been active in working for black children and black women's groups. I know Janet Douglass is the best person to represent you at the convention.
I need your help. The presidential race is too important for us to pass up and too important for us to place in the hands of people who are not concerned about us. Remember, on May 4, vote for the presidential candidate of your choice, and then punch #20 for me; #24 for Mary Bankester; #34 for Gerald Horton; #39 for James Bond; #50 for Janet Douglass; and # 60 for Al Horn.
When the decision is made about who will run this country for the next four years, we'll be looking out for you.
Sincerely,
[signature]

It received almost unanimous support from the United States Savings and Loan League and other sections of the national financial community.
Coupled with that announcement came the speculation - or gossip - in Washington that the President would replace HUD Secretary Lynn with someone with more experience in housing than the Secretary's present background as successful blockbuster in Cleveland - the new appointee would be someone with real expertise in housing finance like Bebe Rebozo or Robert Ablanalp, whose massive high income housing complexes in San Clemente and Key Biscayne have made them world famous.
My own expertise in the housing field stems largely from my constituency: My legislative district is what is euphemistically called an ""Inner City"" district - its inhabitants are largely poor,
2
overwhelmingly Black, and almost uniformly ill housed.
I want to discuss housing in its political context and concentrate largely on governmentally assisted housing, the only kind that marginally serves the poor.
From its inception in 1937, the nature of governmentally assisted housing has been essentially a result of the will of the majority, translated into political power. The middle class, outnumbering the rich and the poor, have possessed the political sophistication to make its collective will felt. Governmental housing programs have been shaped largely by the needs and desires of that group.
Governmentally assisted housing became a reality in the United States only as a result of the Great Depression. There were some gingerly steps toward public housing after the first world war, and a few more in the States during the twenties, but a serious housing
3
program had to wait for the days of the Depression, when millions of members of the middle class, unemployed or underemployed, and therefore no longer able to house themselves comfortably, clamored for a federal program or of subsidized housing.
[Typeset changes as the following paragraphs are cut and pasted onto the paper.]
In 1935, Senator Wagner of New York, introduced a bill in Congress to establish a permanent low-rent public housing administration within the federal bureaucracy. The bill, the Senator argued, would stimulate business activity, increase employment, and assist the local governments to eliminate slums and unsanitary tenements.
On September 1, 1937, President Roosevelt signed the United States Housing Act of 1937, which was to begin a ""new era in the economic and social life of America."" The resultant legislation served middle class interests rather than those of the rock-bottom poor, requiring, for example, that tenants pay moderate rents. Initially, then, governmental housing was intended to be the home of the ""submerged middle class.""
This initial middle class pressure has been manifest demonstrated in most subsequent federal housing legislation, for the political popularity of such housing has risen and fallen according to the ways in which it served the purposes of the middle class. The second major piece of federal housing legislation, the Housing Act of 1949, was passed during the post World War II housing shortage, when the need for housing permeated afflicted the entire population. In passing this Act, Congress made an
4
explicit commitment to establishing as a national goal the realization of a ""decent home and suitable environment for every American family."" While low-rent public housing was given new life -- an even greater impetus was given to FHA and VA insurance which would facilitate home ownership once the economy began its rapid upswing, for the ""submerged"" middle-class residing in public housing. Soon after the war, as the economy climbed, two trends developed which diminished the popularity of low-rent government housing. First, the ""submerged middle class"" of the Depression, with newly acquired mobility and affluence, began to migrate from the cities to the suburbs. Second, blacks began to move from the rural South to the cities. With these two developments, low-rent public housing shifted at an ever increasing rate, from housing for lower middle class whites to housing for impoverished blacks. And with this shift, political support for low-rent housing waned declined. On several occasions in the 1950's, the very life of the public housing program was saved by just a few votes. It was not until the urban ghetto riots of the 1960's that there developed a new, if not transient, sense of urgency and consciousness concerning the housing needs of the poor which led to a series of more innovative laws, such as sections 235 and 236, and more general support of housing for low and moderate income families. However, as our cities quieted down, the support for housing of the poor correspondingly diminished.
It is not difficult to identify the reasons for middle class indifference, and sometimes revulsion, to low-rent housing. From the time that public housing no longer housed the ""submerged middle class,"" self-centered reasons for supporting the programs dissipated. As public housing became increasingly the domain of
5
[Typeset changes.]
blacks, it became a horror from which escape had to be devised. Whites feared that property values would fall, the the neighborhood would become inundated by blacks and that the neighborhood's social status would decline.
[Typeset changes.]
Thus with the continued growth of suburban communities and their sense of insulation, security and exclusiveness, threats to their social and economic homogeneity have been vigorously resisted. The natural constituency of governmentally assisted housing - the poor - have been too weak and unsophisticated politically to assert their needs. The middle class, conversely, has manifested considerable political dexterity in its efforts to exclude such housing. Conscious political diecisions at all levels of government have reinforced the exclusion of housing for the poor and black, and indeed, directed its location so as to perpetuate segregation.
[Typeset changes.]
Consider Atlanta: The ""most progressive city in the South"", a city too busy to hate"", or ""too young to die"". It was in Atlanta in 1936 that the nation's first federally assisted low rent housing was built.
[Typeset changes.]
Six hundred and four (604) units -- an all-white project. While ranked 27th in population nationally, Atlanta now has the 5th largest low-rent public housing program in the nation with over 14,000 units housing over 49,000 people. My legislative district contains over 3,000 of the units -- over 1/4 of them. Forty-nine thousand
6
[Typeset changes.]
people is larger than the population of Athens, Georgia, in fact, only six cities in Georgia and 18 of the state's 159 counties have
[Typeset changes.]
populations in excess of Atlanta's public housing population. These impressive figures, however, take on meaning only when broken down into racial composition and geographical location. At the present time, over 80% of the tenants in Atlanta's public housing are black. By political design, and sometimes by chance, most of this housing has been concentrated within 8 of Atlanta's slums. Of the 14,000 units of low-rent public housing, 56% are located in areas which are 90% to 100% black, and another 20% in areas which are 70% to 90% black. The effect of this has been to limit the interest in public housing to blacks, who comprise 88% to 90% of the 30,000 people on the waiting list.
Two years ago the U.S. District Court in Atlanta, in the case of Crow v. Brown, found that the City of Atlanta, the two counties of which it is comprised, the Atlanta Housing Authority, and the U.S. Department of HUD, through the public housing program had contributed to and helped perpetuate racial segregation in Atlanta. One of the consequences of this racial concentration, stated the Court said, is that it has become virtually impossible to achieve meaningful school desegregation, and that the dispersal of urban housing patterns is the only alternative to massive bussing if desegregation, rather than resegregation, is to be achieved. Another consequence of this racial concentration, the Court found, was a swelling of unemployment rolls in the City since job opportunities have become more scarce each year, while they
7
[Typeset changes.]
have increased in the suburbs. The Court consequently ordered that the county and the housing authority form a joint committee to develop and implement a program of balanced and dispersed pubic housing, including the selection of specific sites that would be appropriate. A noble decision: But the results were less so.
The joint committee, responding to the Court order, selected some 59 despersal sites on which low-density, low-rent public housing could be constructed. Yet, as of this date, no housing has been constructed or is even contemplated for any of the sites. While Nixon's public housing funds cut-off in January had some adverse effect,
[Typeset changes.]
some adverse effect, the Housing Authority did have several hundred units of housing reserved and funded which could have been used were the Nixon Administration & HUD and local governments really so disposed.
In a recent letter to the Court, the Director of the Housing Authority explained its failure to disperse low rent housing as a function of the roles of HUD and local governments. For one thing, the letter said, HUD guidelines indicate little or no commitment to dispersal. While racial dispersal requirements are clear - to the point of making new housing in racially impacted areas almost impossible - the guidelines ignore the costs involved in economic dispersal. Moving people from
8
racially impacted areas means moving them to affluent areas with high land costs. Yet HUD refuses to extend its maximum for land costs per unit of housing, to promote dispersal as mandated by the Court.
For another thing, the leased housing program is financed by HUD at rental levels so low that it is practically impossible for the Housing Authority to obtain such housing built recently in good middle class neighborhoods. Another difficulty citied is that HUD's regulations with respect to environmental impact require major research and voluminous reports. For example, the regulations' heavy emphasis on noise level standards ruled out some otherwise desirable sites, subsequently used by private housing developers. Thus while the Nixon administration has mouthed its fervent support for the dispersal of low-income housing, a political decision was made in Washington that enforcing this policy by making dispersal an economic reality would antagonize the predominately white middle class, the over-whelming majority of the national electorate , the silent majority.
The role of the local governmental entities in failing to meet the Court orders for dispersal, according to the Housing Authority Director's letter to the Court, could be summarized as a failure to establish clear housing goals and a total lack of commitment to the goal of dispersing public housing.
Ironically, this intentional pattern of political decision-making which has concentrated blacks in the inner-city and continues to perpetuate this concentration, has contributed in no small measure to the likelihood of Atlanta electing expected victory tomorrow its of Atlanta's first black Mayor and black City Council majority.
11 9
Having briefly discussed how political decisions have influenced federal housing policy and determined the location of low-rent housing so as to perpetuate racial segregation, let us consider ways, if any, that the political decision-making process can be influenced and perhaps manipulated in the favor of the poor. And let's look again at the Georgia and Atlanta experiences.
The Nixon moratorium on federally assisted housing programs was declared in early January of this year, coinciding almost exactly with the opening of the 1973 Session of the Georgia General Assembly. For several months prior before the opening of the session, there had been informal but serious discussion among members of the House Committee on State Planning and Community Affairs, the House's most progressive committee, on anticipating Nixon's ""New Federalism"" -- the returning of tax dollars to the states in relatively unrestricted grants as manifest by general revenue sharing and his proposed special revenue sharing -- and creating a state housing finance agency which would take that money and effectively utilize it and maximize it with its tax-exempt bond financing power.
tThe idea of state housing finance agencies was conceived of in New York over a decade ago, and has recently been emulated by imitated in 20 or so states. A public corporation is created by the legislature and authorized to issue tax exempt bonds, and to utilize the proceeds of the bonds to make low-interest rate loans -- at about 5 percent or approximately half of the conventional home purchase rate -- to private and non-profit developers for the construction of low- and moderate-income housing. When utilized in conjunction with federal
12 10
Julian Bond
housing subsidies, the agencies have had great flexibility and success in promoting the development of housing for all income levels.
Conspicuously missing from the list of states that have housing finance agencies are those states in the deep South. And this is not because the South has no housing problems.
The South has:


31% of the nation's population


36% of all public housing units


40% of all of the nation's inadequate housing units


40% of the nation's poor;


all as a result of its traditional long-standing economic and social entrenchment. But we felt that the moratorium on federally assisted housing might provide the impetus we needed to gather the rural Georgian legislators political support. After all, the moratorium did spell significant adverse economic effects for Georgia. The slogan, ""Stay alive with Section 235,"" was more than rhetoric to the small time rural Georgia builders and contractors -- it was, in fact, their livelihood. Even Georgia Senator Herman Talmadge -- who had never been a particularly vociferous spokesman on behalf of housing for the poor -- blasted Nixon for his callous action, having in mind, of course, the actions its effect on his home builder constituents.
Taking the message from Talmadge, the Committee prepared a detailed report on the potential economic effects of an 18 month loss of federal subsidies in Georgia -- in terms of dollars in housing construction that would be lost to
11
the State and in terms of man working hours lost. Politically, the key to getting enactment was clearly through appealing to the pockets of the rural legislators. In fact, the mention of housing for low- and moderate-income families was consciously, but with great difficulty, omitted from all public dialogue. For even just talking about state involvement in housing finance -- even for moderate income families -- evoked among Georgia's ""statesmen"" the image and stigma of public housing for blacks.
Once the bill was finally drafted, only a month remained in the 1973 Session: hardly adequate time to rally political support for a major piece of complex legislation, particularly in view of the fact that over 1,000 pieces of legislation still had to be considered by the House and the Senate. The events that transpired, while mostly depressing, were also extremely edifying, and as a result of the our learning from that experience, there is a good likelihood that the bill will become a law this year in 1974.
One of the time-consuming difficulties we confronted was dealing with the question of the bill's legality. The Governor, who was generally in support of the bill, refused to openly support it until convinced of its ability to withstand a Court test. Since ,although almost identical legislation had been upheld in the Supreme Courts of some 18 other states.
The problem, it turned out, was that the Attorney General's office was hung up over whether or not financing housing was a ""public purpose"" for which state funds could be utilized. It seems that the Georgia Constitution enumerates as a public purpose, ""the housing of poultry and livestock,"" but not the housing of people.
12
We were able to get around this surreal obstacle by inserting in the legislation the provision that the bill's purpose was to stimulate the economy of Georgia by promoting commerce and industry, an enumerated public purpose.
Later , a public hearing on the housing bill was held for special interest groups. The first speaker on the agenda was the President of Georgia's [Typeset changes.] influential Home Builders Association, who proudly announced that, while he had not read the bill, he opposed it for five reasons.
The bill, of course, posed none of the threats he suggested, which included the threat of the State Housing Finance Agency putting small contractors out of business by a creeping communist take-over of all housing construction activity. Needless to say, the remarks of the President of the Home Builders Association cast serious, but totally unfounded, questions in the minds of others who had come to testify in favor of the bill. The housing bill consequently did not develop enough momentum to even get out of committee. With the economic effects of the moratorium now being acutely felt, and with
13
plenty of time now to mobilize support, the likelihood of passage during the upcoming session appears quite good.
This brief hisotyrtory of a dream deferred demonstrates rather clearly how political pressures and economic interest dominate the decision making about where all of us shall live, where we shall work, and how and where we will be educated.
These decisions are seldom made in a vacuum, but are made in the larger context of the city's - or the state's or the nation's - political view of what, if anything, is good for or needed by the society's underclass.
A recent study by the Joint Economic Committee of the United States Congress found that two thirds of all Federal housing subsidies are tax subsidies, subsidies to the middle and upper classes, a demonstration of the old truism that America's government
14
believes strongly in socialism for the wealthy and capitalism for the poor.
That condition will prevail, unless and until the ill-housed can join forces with a larger segment of the general population to insure that housing for all becomes a reality.
That force has to make itself heard in Council and Legislative Chambers where the only voices now speaking out are those grown fat and sluggish on dollars from the Federal till, but who oppose any extension of governmental largesse to the poor.
Until that coalition of the unwanted can become a reality, nothing can be expected to change.

The Questions that most affects our lives are the ones that have been created from the day the first whiteman set foot on what he called America. From that day to this we have been treated as if we were only living and surviving at this pleasure and discretion. We have never been allowed to fully enjoy the comforts that we built for him. 
We might honestly say that our position was bestdescribed 100 years ago by a Black Georgian, Henry McNeill Turner, who in 1868, trying to describe conditions for Black Georgians of his era, correctly described our economic position now. He said then: ""We have pioneered a civilisation here. We have built up your country. We have worked in your fields, we have gathered your harvests, for 250 years .... We, who number hundreds of thousands... have not a foot of land to 
2
call our own. We are strangers in the land of our birth, without money, without education, without aid, without a roof to cover us while we live or clay to cover us when we die.""
It might be argued that conditions have improved a bit since then, but objectively, things are still pretty much the same.
Housing, employment, and education, all the ingredients necessary to make our communities whole have been nearly non-existent for us in the kind of directions which he thrust himself into when he defeated the British in 1776 and freed himself from taxation without representation.
It is a shame that we have not been inspired to fight a similar battle over taxes ourselves, for if any group pays a heavy penalty - financially and spiritually - for mere survival in the American welfare state, it is us.
Not only have we had to build the railroads, houses and schools, but we have had to serve him his food, nurse his children and fight his wars. 
Indeed, the last 300 years for Black people have been no crystal stair. Our sweat and toil in America has been one that I seriously doubt any other ethnic group has experienced and uniquely, we have been under more undue strain and pressure than any other Americans to pull ourselves up, but without the base which other white ethnic groups had to secure economic and political power.
The Ladders of upward financial mobility open to the voluntary immigrants who came to these shores seeking freedom from oppression are closed to us, the Americas's single group of involuntary arrivals. The European/ American drew his strength from his ability to retain and draw from his European culture, while the African/American saw his culture, language, religion and family destroyed. As slavery passed from the scene, we entered into a permanent phase of un- and under-employment from which we have yet to emerge, while the European found the growth of mercantile capitalism especially fitted to his cashbox mentality.
We have had to endure physical and verbal abuse. Take hand me down
4
housing... raggedy pawn shop furniture... third and fourth hand books... debilitated automobile for transportation... spend exhorbitant bus, train and subway fares to get to our jobs which never met with dignity when we got to them, and yet we are still told we have to pull ourselves up by our bootstraps.
This is a cruel suggestion for a people without any boots at all.
But we have survived.  We wear our battle scars proudly and continue to move and mobilize our people to obtain the right to a decent life where our culture, our beauty, our soul can be reflected in the kinds of ways necessary to make our communities whole and financially stable.
Moving in this direction we must begin taking advantage of the various methodsavailable to us. We should not single out any one method or way to make ourselves free. But we need to understand the mind of this nation which is controlled by less than one percent of it s population. We have to be clear in our minds when we call down 
5
the power structure exactly what we mean and what power we can grasp to change it.
The economic power structure of the United States is extremely political. One of the best examples is fact that the varied industries which are supposed to be regulated by various government agencies in fact control those agencies. The FCC does not regulate broadcasting, it looks after the vested interests of broadcasters, routinely renewing radio and television licenses while denying challenges to those public licenses from individuals and groups who are locked out of the opportunity to broadcast on the public airways. The Federal Trade Commission is known as a cowardly bureaucratic body beholden to consumer industries instead of protecting consumers, and so on down the line - the ICC serving the railroad and trucking industries; the FAA acting as the tool of the airline interest. The Agriculture Department representing racist policies and handing out 
6
billions to six thousand plantation owners not to grow food. The Defense Department which gives fifty billion dollars annually to underwrite corporate aircraft giants to make mistakes with C-5A's and pad pocketbooks of former Pentagon Generals. The Justice Department with Mitchell and Hoover who oversee monopolistic enterprise and the major gambling syndicates and do nothing, yet persecute Black Panthers and Black people who dare speak up for their rights.
With our history of oppression and the current and past climate of repression aimed at us, with the might of government aimed at protecting the power of the few who have against the many who have not, with the official economic policy of the United States socialism and welfare millionarism for the wealthy and capitalism and free enterprise for the poor, it is no wonder that economic development stands high on our list of priorities. 
We are witnessing the beginning of a totalitarian state not only for Black people, but for all Americans. As in George Orwell's
7
prophetic 1984, the first steps are being taken by the destruction of privacy and the subversion of the English language. As in 1984, large segments of the population are becoming so accustomed to the oppression that they are no longersshocked by it. The assassination and imprisonment of dissenters is becoming a routine of American life.
""Doublethink"", the process of confusing words until they mean their opposites, seemed fanciful when Orwell wrote his classic. The present administration is turning fancy into an everyday reality. 
""Freedom"" is killing Vietnamese in order to make them ""free""; destroying villages to ""free"" them, arming fascists' dictatorships in Greece and Cambodia to keep the Greek and Cambodian people ""free"", and exploiting the resources and peoples of whole continents in the name of ""free"" trade.
""Peace"" means vast preparations for nuclear war, the expansion of the Vietnam War to all of Southeast Asia, the stifling of nonviolent 
8
protest, and winning wars that were lost before they were begun.
""Benign"" is an adjective to describe a deliberate policy of indifference or neglect.
""Together"" is where we bring the people when we call some of them ""bums"" and ""effete snobs"".
""Protecting free enterprise"" means millions of dollars in subsidies and a novel form of millionaire welfarism to government contractors, monopolistic corporations, and farmers who don't farm.
The political language of our society is becoming so polluted with ""doublethink"" and hypocrisy that sensible discussion of issues grows steadily more difficult.
What can be done to solve these problems? The administration spokesmen assure us that violence is not the way - just after they assure us that they will not do anything regardless of what we say in a peaceful, nonviolent manner.They assure us that we can get their ear only if we lower our voices, then tell us that millions of 
9
nonviolent voices will not affect them at all. Nixon tells Blacks that the business system, not the government, will save us from economic destitution. The business system knows better. A much more candid sstatement of what business will do under existing circumstances is the following from the publisher of the The Bankers Magazine: 
""Despite all the exhortations at the business symposiums, social and economic threats inherent in racial schism and violence in America have not yet reached the crisis proportions which would make business anti-poverty efforts a vital business need - essential to the circumstance of corporate profits, the preservation of capital, or the survival of commerce. As slong as this is the case, effort by private business to rehabilitate... the ghetto economy... will fail since the effort does not fulfill essential corporate needs or the need to make a profit, whatever is being sold to whomever for whichever reason."" 1
10
The author of that statement is also the founder of the Atomic Energy Law Journal, a director of the Bank Tax Institute and current chairman of the Banking Law Institute. He his saying very clearly that Black people will never have economic freedom unless they muster the force to threaten or counter or nearly parallel the existence of the entire American economic system. Issuspect that if he were Black, talk like that would get him thrown in jail and I am sure he hates Black people who talk about destroying the economic system that has created his own highly privileged status. But I also suspect he is right about how far we will have to be prepared to go if we are going to be free. We had better face the situation and get ourselves ready to take care of business, whether it is the kind of business he represents, or the kind of humanistic, non-capitalistic business that represents commerce in human relationships, not in dollars and cents.
11
However, taking care of business does not have to mean more violence.
The question then takes us back to where we as Black people want to go. Knowing the odds stacked against us, we have to reach out to our brothers and sisters who have not reached the economical level that many of us in this room today have.
As Cross said in his book on Black Capitalism, ""The painfully apparent features of the ghetto economy are its economic weakness, a low level of productivity, and the poverty level of its consumers.""
Dr. Kenneth Clark description of our neighborhood, the ghetto, as a ""social, educational, political and economic colony"" is especially important for us to remember.
What we must do, I believe, is connect positive programming with the various grouping of Black people who are striving towards the same goal. 
12
For instance, in Alabama the SWAFCA program is currently engaged in developing land programs and collectively farming the land. Black people now own substantial acreage and are producing needed food and fiber for other Black people. Yet little recognition of this worthwhile program has come from the Black businessmen from the North, Midwest or Western cities who are developing their own economic programs to promote Black business. These plans, like that presently underwritten by the honorable Elijah Muhammad in the South, operations which put Black people into a healthy and productive relationship with our environment, must receive national support.
Furthermore, we ought to strive toward further collectivization of our own economic thrust, so that we do not get caught up in the degrading practice of some of us obtaining all the wealth while our brothers and sisters are still hungry.
It is cruel and criminal to have outmoded capitalism thrust upon
13
upon us, either dressed in Black or under its new presumably less offensive name, minority entrepreneurship. Capitalism has not solved white people's problems. If it had, physicists would not be driving taxi cabs today. What we need is something more properly described as ""community socialism"", enabling a larger share of us to get our hands on the dollars that pass through - and all too often out -  of our community. That means that if an economic enterprise does business in our community, we havetto stop being consumers but must become owners as well. As much as I despise racketeering, prostitution and the numbers, if these are to be tolerated by the white controlled law enforcement agencies that rule this country, then we must control them too. It is too much to keep us from even making a dishonest dollar in our own community.
In short, we must control what exists where we are. We must always strive for the greatest good for the largest number of us.
14
That means trying to control General Motors as much as it means trying to take over the corner Mom and Pop store, although the first is unlikely and the second may simply exchange colors of the neighborhood cheats. 
If the second is done, however, it may lay the foundation for a series of growth steps for us, leading from our store to our farm to our distribution system to what is most important, money in the pockets of our people. 
If the first is done, and General Motors through some oracle should fall into our hands, it might mean we could build an automobile that would last for more than eighteen months.
If both these adventures are begun, begun seriously with our people in mind and their interests foremost, then something must succeed.
If nothing, does and if, as it appears it will, times get harder, then we had better seriously prepare to take care of business ourselves.

By the end of April, options for Black Democratic activists will have been reduced to 3 choices of strategy already being employed by Blacks lacking a coherent, organized and centrally directed plan for action.
(Such a plan should have been developed nearly two years ago; it was not too early then to know what our issues should be now. Each of us, of course, knew that in 1976--with us or without us--America would elect a President.)
Our present choices are these:

To arbitrarily select one of the several candidates competing in the remaining primaries and throw our weight behind him;
to develop now a detailed platform of our own, broad enough to attract a large section of the population, real enough to have some expectation of eventual implementation, and specific enough so that each candidate who accepts it
2
	will be bound to specific acts, not just the general promises of the past; 
to see that each candidate has some of us in his organization, with real administrative power within the campaign structure.

Quite obviously, many Blacks have already chosen option #1 and half of option #3-- there are Black supporters in each candidate's camp, although none seems to hold real power.
Some of these seem to view their candidate merely as a device to transport them to the convention; for others, the choice of candidate was made capriciously or with the faint hope of on-the-campaign-trail-education.
I strongly support option #2, if it is not too late, and would urge that:
(a) Our brightest specialists in public policy be commissioned to construct a platform which meets the criteria outlined in option #2; 
(b) that we obtain--from our numbers--the largest possible list of endorsees, and a pledge from each endorser not to back any candidate who will not agree in writing, publically, with our platform, and
(c) that we then ask each candidate to accept or reject--without qualification or reservation--our notion of what America needs in foreign and domestic affairs over the next 4 years.
(Even while suggesting the above, I am sure it will not succeed.
First, too many of us have invested too much psychological energy into our particular favorite to be diverted by anything as fragile as an issue. Secondly, we are quickly discovering that the primary process may render our ability to pick and choose useless by reducing the available candidates to such a small number--two--that the only decision will be made between them for first and second spot on the ticket; and third, our

platform writing process may produce a document ""too Black"" to be seriously considered by any candidate who knows that the number of Black voters is declining, and that at least 85% of those of us who will vote in November will vote for the Democratic nominee anyway. This last deserves some brief discussion--let us not let our understandable paranoia lead us to believe that none of the candidates are speaking to our concerns, however wrongly or obliquely-- the candidate who says ""Black"" at every occasion is no more guaranteed our friend than the man who never says it is our enemy--our interests are best served by the candidate who proposes directing federal attention and monies at areas of our concern: in developing an urban policy, in job creation programs, and so on.
Let us learn to separate policy statements from the confines of race, without ever abandoning our commitment to parity in every sphere of life.)
Let us additionally realize that we are more like our white countrymen and women than we may care to admit.

BLACK PERSPECTIVE - Garrett/Julian 
(OPEN ON: GARRETT AND JULIAN IN BLACK PERSPECTIVES SET)
(SLIDE: BLACK PERSPECTIVE)
(MUSIC: )
GARRETT:
Good evening, and welcome to Black Perspective. I'm your host, Garett Morris. Tonight our guest is Mr. Julian Bond, and we'll be talking about the myths surrounding Black I.Q. Specifically, the myth that Whites are inherently more intelligent than Blacks.
JULIAN:
Good evening.
GARRETT:
Now Julian, perhaps you could explain something to me. In all these studies comparing Black I.Q. to White I.Q., what kind of test is used to measure I.Q.s in the first place?
JULIAN:
Well, this is the major problem with these studies. The measurements of I.Q. which form the basis of comparison come from tests composed by Whites for Whites. The
(MORE)
2
JULIAN: (Contd)
tests are culturally bound; it's not surprising that Whites would score better than Blacks.
GARRETT:
Could you give us an example of what you're talking about?
JULIAN:
Certainly; here are some questions that have appeared on recent I.Q. tests. Number one: ""You have been invited over for cocktails by the officer of your trust fund. Cocktails begin at 4:30, but you must make an appearance at a 6:00 pre-cotillion dinner party. What do you do about dress? A. Wear your blue seersucker suit to cocktails and change into your tuxedo in the bathroom, apologizing to your host for the inconvenience. B. Wear your tuxedo to cocktails, apologizing to your host for wearing a dinner jacket before 6:00 P.M. C. Walk to the subway at Columbus Circle and take the ""A"" Train uptown.
GARRETT:
Uh, I guess I'd choose the last one.
3
JULIAN:
I'm sorry, that's incorrect.
GARRETT:
Damn.
JULIAN:
Here's another: ""When wavxing your skis for a cross-country run, you should ...
GARRETT:
INTERRUPTING)
Well, I think I understand the problem with the tests. But the fact is that people have been saying that White people are smarter than Blacks for hundreds of years. We've only had I.Q. tests for twenty or thirty years. How did the idea of white intellectual superiority originate?
JULIAN:
That's an interesting point. My own theory is that it's based on the fact that light-skinned Blacks are smarter than dark-skinned Blacks.
GARRETT:
Say what?
4
JULIAN:
I said I think it might have grown out of the observation that light skinned Blacks are smarter than dark-skinned Blacks.
GARRETT:
I don't get it.
JULIAN:
It's got nothing to do with having White blood. It's just that descendants of the lighter-skinned African tribes are more intelligent than the descendants of the darker-skinned tribes. Everybody knows that.
GARRETT:
This is the first I've heard of it.
JULIAN:
Seriously? It was proven a long time ago.
GARRETT:
Well, I still don't quite understand. We're out of time right now, but perhaps you could come back on the show again and explain it further.
5
JULIAN:
There's very little to explain, it's just like I told you.
GARRETT:
Well, we are out of time. Good night ...

If you could repeat it just once more ...

You may be wondering why I am hosting Saturday Night.
I saw Ralph Nader make a perfect ass of himself, and quite frankly, Fran Tarkenton wasn't much better.
So when I received the invitation--and the chance of a fee only two-thirds as large as the Beatles were promised to do this show--I was a little hesitant.
After all, despite superficial resemblances, I'm not Richard Pryor.
Contrary to popular myth, not all of us can sing or dance.
I was worried that the Not Ready For Prime Time Players would embarrass me in some way, or that the scatalogical humor employed too frequently on this show might cheapen my dignity.
But, I thought, it's all in fun, and most people realize that the jokes and humor are just that.
Satire is the highest form of wit--any society that can't afford to poke a little fun at itself is in danger of taking itself too seriously.
But my mind was really made up when I saw the show hosted by Broderick Crawford a few weeks ago.
During the Weekend Update segment, Jane Curtin mentioned that she wasn't wearing any underpants.
2
I didn't know if she meant it, so I decided to come and see for myself. At first I decided to affix a little mirror on the toe of my shoe--like this--but I've finally settled on a high school favorite, patent leather.
I plan to engage her in conversation and then to drop a play mouse on the floor, causing her to be distracted while I'll look downward.
I haven't figured out how to get her to wear the shoes though. If I give her a pair, I'll have to give some to Gilda and Lorraine too, and maybe even to the men in the show.
I may have to go back to the mirror.

But itf Jesus Ch was concerned for the whole person in the whole community, then there can be no separation between us. That ""vision includes the institutions of governments of the people committed to peaceful coexistence and self determination for all races and cultural groups, universal human rights—including the right of revolution for just cause, equal justice, the fair and equitable distribution of wealth, the protection of the weak and helpless, and the fostering of human fulfillment by the enhancement of culture and religion.""
If Christ did say ""The spirit of the Lord is upon me to ] set at liberty those who are oppressed,"" then the Black church has felt that spirit too.[*]
No historian can set down on paper the totality of what the Black church and its leaders—preachers, pastors, laymen and deacons—have meant to us.
[Hand-drawn line perhaps indicating first and second paragraphs should be joined.]
No scribe can recordthe firey words spoken from pulpit after pulpit. No list can ever count the thousands who received not just religious and moral instruction but political instruction from in thousands of [illegible] on God’s houses scattered in every town and village and city where we are. No bank can hold the money raised to educate our children, to protect the weak, to shore up the strong, to finance schools and banks and homes for a people who by themselves, had only pennies to spend. No roll of on earth will ever carry t all the names of lives saved salvaged, of families begun, of souls saved by the Black church.
No other institution touches so many of us so often. Believer and doubter, we are enveloped by the church and her works. Her building shelters us. Her leaders guide us, and her teachings keep us on the straight and narrow path.
The Gospel of Jesus Christ was known among African people by the end of the 2nd Century, long before it was extended North and East of the basin of the Mediterranean Sea.
The noted scholar, Nathan Irvin Huggins, writes of how the slave experience captured Christianity and made it different than it had been before.
""Africans had preconceptions about how the universe was ordered,"" Huggins writes, ""how each was linked with other beings and things, both in the time that was past as well as in the time that was yet to come. The African knew himself to be one with nature; everything about him was, like himself, a being in nature. Animals, plants, and trees had spirit and life within them—even stones, houses and rivers had indwelling spirits. The force of creation had caused them all—was in them all and those who passed beyond the living left a spirit that abided. The African’s world was intermixed with tangible and spiritual realities, which wove him into all of nature, and the present into all pasts and futures."" ] 4
""This was the world in which the African had found his meaning. He would rediscover himself in America as he adapted his world view to the institutions and practices he encountered. In time, most Africans would become some variety of Christian. But the European religion would be the shell their faith was to inhabit, and that they would alter that religioin as their spirit moved through it. There would remain an African texture and tone to Black Christianity, and some would say that the white American’s religious imagination would never totally free itself of the touch of Africa.
""The great awakening of the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries opened American Protestantism to the Afro-American. Evangelists preached a gospel that put spirit and heart over mind. They understood the didactism of the American church, shifting the emphasis from human impotence to human possibility for redemption. A person needed only to open h his heart to the Holy Spirit to be saved—make himself the receptable of divine will. ""This evangelical movement tended to break through the formalism of the church, opening religious experience to people through an d exhorting preacher. The Great Wakening was the beginning of an American revivalist tradition, which was to sweep the countryside in spasmadic waves, drawing in Blacks and being chancged by that fact.""
""The Methodist and Baptist denominations most affected this gospel. In their relatively loose and democratic structures, and in their unashamed acceptance ] 5 of spirit and emotionalism, they were the most hospoitable to Afro-Americans.""
""The white congreations congregants, however, were seldom pleased with Black membership in their churches. While admitted to their churches, Blacks were generally segregated to pews in the rear or the balcony, and sometimes were obliged to hold separate services. It was these restrictions as well as the constraints they felt in white congregations that inspired the formation of the frist Afro-American churches: Silver Bluff, South Carolina, in 1773, Boston in 1808, and Philsdelphia in 1816.""
""Worshiping separately, even as Christians, allowed the African tradition to linger and survive through the Black preacher, who was more exhorter exhorter than pastor. His langueage and style was filled with cosmic imagery, punctuated by sounds like drums rather than words—grunts and claps of hands—one voice in a chorus of voice of the congregants. The worship was not the message of one man to his flock. Rather, it was the birthing, expanding, sustaining of an atmosphere in which all worshipers were transported. It rose and intensified ] 6 with the preacher’s words against the hums and responses of the congregation, until the spirit was palpable in their midst. The Holy Spirit moved among them and through them, possessed them, until one or another’sbody moved; sounds came from within their mouths as if another’s will was were within them, making the bodies move in spasms and jerks, shaping the sounds of their shouts.""
""Worship was the evoking of religious experience through the collective, rather than the individual, will. This was common in Black religious practice, more subdued perhaps in Northern and urban churches, more full and spontaneous in the plantation cabin or woods - but Africa survived in them all.""
""Afro American Christianity was less guilt burdened that white Christianity. Evil and sin existed, but they were forces of the universe, not of man's natural condition. The Devil played his role in the world, but he resembled a the trickster of African lore - like the joker in a deck of cards, changing all the rules at on whim. Man could be the victim of Satan, but the repentant man could find his exceuse in the Devil, not in himself. Man was weak, but not corrupt. The African transformed their sesnse of cosmic lif life into the term God, and in that way, they never quite lost ye the idea that everything was subsumed under it, even man. So God was responsbile for man's weakness, and in his ultimate wisdom, understood man's frailities.""
""The wayward person could know, therefore, that he was never really lost, so long as he could open himself to the power of life that would enfold withim in him.""
""Afro-American Christianity never lost its fundamentally collective and social character. In this, it differed from most forms of American Christianity. The highly individualistic thrust pf Puritanism characterized early American Protestantism x and was modified but not changed by the introduction of revivals. The typical Black Christian, (however,) understood all religious experience to be generated by the community at worship; the congregation and the meeting were all-important.""
Europeans used the word ""Lord"" to refer to the son of God, but the word had associations with feudal and magisterial authority. Black Cristians also called Jesus ""Lord"" of course, but the word also symbolically touched on lamb of God, the Spirit, themselves, and all godly manifestations. The prayers of Black Christians were less likely to be supplications upward to authority than they were to be directed both ] 7 outward and inward to establish the unity of spirit with self, and to be one in the body of God.""
""The most common and fervent prayer was ""Come Jesus, come Lord. Be among us now."" Black Christians talked as intimates with the Lord and Old Testament characters - Brother Moses, Sister Mary, Brother Jonah. To become Christian meant to join that extended family."" [**]
When the slaves wanted somewhere to meet, half-free and partially protected, they chose the church. When the first schools for Blacks freedmen were established, their founders chose the church. Whenever Black people wanted sanctuary, and safety, and independence from the pervasive white world around them, they chose the church. When a white Georgia farmer wanted to make himself ""all-right"" with Black people, he chose the church.
Yet even this institution can stand some correction, can stand some suggestion, can stand some friendly push toward greater glory in service to of God and to man.
If there ever was a time when we needed that service, that time is now. Let me put you in the picture we see painted tighter and ] 8 tighter around us.
For most Black Americans, the first three hundred and fifty years on American soil have been the hardest. We got here before the Mayflower did, and that’s the last time we’ve been ahead of anybody for anything. From the days when someone owned us to the days where we own little or nothing, things seem not to have changed much at all.
Go back, if you will, not three hundred and fifty years, but back to the beginning of the twentieth century.
When the year 1900 rolled around, Black people were slaves in every way but legally. Most of us could not vote. Nearly all of us went to segregated schools, and in the South, for only a few months each year. Most of us could not hope to become educated beyond high school. Most of us worked from can to can't, if we were lucky to work at all.
By 1970, much of this had changed, and changed for the better. Most of us had excaped the farm for the city. Most of us are now ] 9 able to vote, even if we choose not to do so. Most of our children now go to schools that are integrated by law, if segregated by fact. We have become doctors, lawyers, teachers, office holders—have spead ourselves across the entire spectrum of American employment.
Yet even this progress is deceptive. In 1971, we were ten per cent of t the workers of America, but only 1 per cent of the engineers, only 2 per cent of the doctors, only 3 per cent of the managers and administrators, only 6 per cent of the craftsmen, as contrates with 17 per cent of the service workers, 20 per cent of the laborers, and 50 per cent of the household workers.
And we have always been twice as many of those who have had no job at all.
In those seventy years, we moved from the back of the bus to the front of the unemployment line, from the small town South to the unfriendly North, from the cotton field to the welfare rolls.
Along the way, from the bosom of the church there sprung a mighty movement, responsible today from ? the gains we now enjoy.
That movement seems to sag now, sadly because some of us may believe that we don’t 10 need it any more.
Nothing could be further from the truth. Now, more than ever, we need the moral power and the spiritual vision that the church has given us. We need it in our chirches and in the streets, in the pulpit and at the polling place.

Nearly two decades now have elapsed since the reluctant dawn of still another new era for Black Americans. 1960 marked the beginning of a tumultuous time when old dreams, and new dreamers would flourish or die, when swift, often violent upheaval would challenge the nation’s two-hundred-year old policy of ""separate but neverunequal"" policies.
It began as a conservative time, the celebration of the status quo, when young men and women who called themselves ""Black"" invited the scorn of their elders whowere still fighting to be called capital ""N"" Negroes with a capital N. If our history was not familiar
2
to the nation, our status was painfully clear. We were a people whose passage to these shores had been described as ""one long line of blood, with tossing limbs and the echoing cries of death and pain,""1 we had been declared a problem--by the same group who created the ""problem"", and then neglected to develop a solution. ] 11 
It was a landmark year for young Blacks; the question ""where were you during the sit-ins"" when they marched in the streets"" would become as much a part of the national Black litany as a recitation of one’s whereabouts at the moment of the murders of John and Bobby Robert Kennedy, or the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King.
To millions of Black teenagers today, the sit-ins, lie-ins and marches, the hoses, cattle prods and jails, the
3
fractured skulls and shallow graves that marked the bloody sixties are already distant history, replete with revisionism and indistinguishable from television docu-drama. To Black adults, the ""protests"" symbolized a passing of the torch, an unorthodox extensions of the struggle long waged through traditional channels--the NAACP, churches, voter’s leagues, and ""sitting up"" with the white folks. Predictably, some Blacks deplored the new activism as jeopardizing existing gains.
It was true that Black people had progressed since our arrival in 1620 on the inhospitable shores of the newly stolen land. We were no longer bartered and used like plows and bags of seed. We were better off than the four million freed
4
at Emancipation who ] 12 set about to raise their families and make a living without, for the most part skills, or money, and or land. We had survived Reconstruction, Jim Crow, lynch law, disenfranchisement, discrimination, and segregation,survived several depressions, and two great wars. ,and the] witch hunts of the McCarthy era. We had survived although some of us didn't recognize his symptoms in time to prevent a national disgrace--the ""Checkers"" speech of the man who this year proclaimed himself a ""paranoid for peace"" and claimed his prize of $600,000 on the television spectacle, ""Deface the Nation.""
Through it all we had struggled to climb out of degradation, poverty, illiteracy; to get--and keep--a decent job,
5
and to ensure a better life for our children. And in 1960, when a new President asked what we could do for our country, the answer was soon forthcoming.
Setting aside intellectual discussion in favor of organization, young Blacks tested political theory with their feet. Dialectic took a back seat to the lunch counter sit-in, to drinking from a certain water fountain, to riding the bus in the seat of our choice, and registering to vote for the candidate of our choosing. Lives were changed, and some were lost, along the way. Mrs. Fannie Lou Hamer, whose death earlier this year was not so much from disease as from living and fighting for human rights in rural Mississippi, summed it up when she said ""We didn’t come for
6
no two seats, ’cause all of us ] 13 is tired!""
The nation was changed along the way, grudgingly, painfully. Not a sector has gone unaffected: federal money flows in new directions; Blacks hold office in formerly white enclaves; bureaucracies proliferate; lawsuits, rulings, and legislation abound; quotas sprout at every hand; experts and scholars monitor, interpret and predict our activity.
[This paragraph is crossed out, but ""Keep"" is written in the margin.] Because our lives change so rapidly in some ways, yet remain so stagnant in others, it is imperative that we pause to review our condition. Federal figures provide a statistical measuring stick:2
We are eleven percent of the population, or 23.4 million
7
people. Our numbers have doubled since 1940; although our birth rate declines is going down, we increase are growing at a faster rate than whites. 53% of all Blacks people live in the South, although nearly one-and-a-half million migrated North and West since 1960. 76% of us live in metropolitan areas, with 13.7 million living in central cities. Our life expectancy has doubled since 1900, although a male child Black boy born in 1974 can expect to live only 62.9 years, while white men boys will ] 14 live six more years. Our infant and maternal death rates continue to decline go down, although three Black women still die in childbirth for every white one. We are more likely to be homicide or suicide victims. Our illiteracy has dropped, but at a slower rate than whites.
Unemployment rates have soared climbed for Blacks, but more than nine million of us held jobs in 1975, nearly fifty percent
8
more than in 1960. In that year, when the median income for Black families was $3233., 46.6% of us earned less than $3000., and fewer than one percent earned more than $15,000. By 1975, the median income for Black families had risen to $9321., while 11.4% of us remained below the $3000. level, and more than 26% earned over $15,000. While that our median figure income is only 65% of 1975 what white earnings people earned, we are ten percent closer to wage equality in wages than in 1960. Nearly one of two Black women are employed, but more than 54% of all working Black mothers with children under 18 live below the poverty level, compared to only 34% of white women so situated with any children under 18.
Unemployment among Black teenagers reached a shocking
9
forty percent during October [1976] of last year, twice the 1970 rate seven years ago. 7.5 million, or One of every three Black people, continue to live below the poverty level, as compared with one out of every ten whites. 63% of poor Black families now are headed by women. Nearly four million Black children live in poverty, of whom one-third live with only one parent, on less than $3,000. a year, on welfare, and inadequate diets, and in substandard housing. Welfare dollars counted for one of every eight dollars of the Black women’s income, compared to one of every fifty dollars for white women.
The government survey notes tells us that Blacks now own nearly as many television sets as whites do, and as many refrigerators-- and yet but we put less in them-- the median Black people eats 200 fewer calories
10
worth of food per day than does the median white. people do. 
Nearly all children, Black and white alike, are enrolled in elementary school, but only one of every 33 recipients of the doctorate degree in 1975 was Black. Despite the shockingly high drop-out rate for Black high school youths, some one million now attend college, four times the number in 1964. One out of four white college age youth old enough are enrolled in college, but only little more than one out of six Blacks, ] 15 while enrollment of Blacks in professional schools remains at less than five percent.
The federal government claims to have increased its 1964 outlay of $7.9 billion to enefit persons below the poverty level, by nearly 400%. In 1974, they say, $27.0 billion went for
12
[The first line and last two lines on this page are added in a different typeset than the rest of the page.]
In the meantime, as we are lulled to sleep by the unfamiliar sound of of federal dollars--our tax dollars--flowing into pockets and programs, and we may be tempted to relax in our comparative affluence and anticipate a an oncoming golden age. Self-congratulation is premature and complacency is self-delusion. While we struggled to raise ourselves over the ""mudsill level,"" the nation’s economy turned from the industrial to the post-industrial stage, from lavish affluence launched on largely borrowed capital and a foreign war, to a floundering, debt-ridden post-affluent society.
The present economic system, based on traditional assumptions, steeped in Keynesian theories of the thirties, defies analysis in any but the narrowest terms. Social policies, molded on the thumb-in-the-dike method of flood control, fluctuate
Through all this change, there has remained the central problem, the problem tghe late Dr. W. E. B. DuBois called ""the greater
14
the conservation of our basic resources of land, labor, capital, and knowledge, addressed the problems of inflation, unemployment, capital shortages, fiscal crises, decaying transportation systems, human crises, nuclear hazards, and global interdependence. I would add to that list what Dr. W.E.B. DuBois called ""the greater problem , which obscures the basic one--the problem of the color line-- is the fact that so many civilized persons are willing to live in comfort even if the price of this is poverty, ignorance and disease of the majority of their fellow man; that to maintain this privilege men have waged war--and the excuse for this war continues largely to be color and race."" 4
Blacks who have long placed their ""faith in education as
[Typeset changes.]
What has happened to us then is that we are like a people on a see-saw. We go up in one direction and go down in another.
It doesn’t matter if you sit can sit in the front of the bus if you’ve got no place to go. It doesn’t matter if you have the right to vote, if you have to choose between Tweedledum and Tweedledee. It doesn’t matter if the schools are integrated, if your children are bussed from one ignorant academy to another. It doesn’t matter if you can sit down at the lunch counter, if you’ve got a champagne appetite and a coca-cola pocketbook.
A few days ago, Vernon Jordan, the Executive Director of the National Urban League, attracted the attention of the nation when he told the President of the United States that we were sick and tired of being sick and tired.
He didn’t say anything new. And he didn’t say anything wrong. He said what a lot of you have been thinking to yourselves, and what a few people have been whispering, but he said it out loud, and a lot of people listened. And a lot of people said ""Amen!""
They said ""amen"" when they heard that 91% of the Black ] 18 people who voted last November 2nd voted for the Carter Mondale team. They said ""amen"" when they heard that those voters gave the Democrats the a slo solid win in 13 states, 13 states whose electoral votes gave the winning team 216 of the 270 electoral votes they needed to send Gerry Ford back to playing golf. C They said ""amen"" when they heard that the time is now for some payback.
What we all need to be about, now, as 1977 slowly slides by away, is the rebuilding of the old movement that made it possible for the grandsons of slaves to put the son grandson of a slaveowner in the White House.
The people in your churches need jobs, but they aren’t getting them. The people in your churches need sfafe safe homes to live in, but they aren’t getting them. The people in your churches need welfare reform, not cutbacks and cutoffs. They need and energy package, not more money for the oil companies.
There is a lesson to be learned here, and it is a simple oae. one. Next ti
We can’t afford in the future to vote for a candidate just because he knows the words to our hymns and not the numbers on our ] 19 paycheck.
We can't afford a man who loves us in the campaign and leaves us out of the government.
We can’t afford to balance the budget when our lives are pocketbooks are upset. [Moved up from the line below with an arrow.]
We can’t afford to vote for anyone because we like him; the question is, does he like us?
We can’t afford human rights in Russia and burned out cities at home. We can’t afford a few new Black faces in Washington’s high places if it means no jobs for you and me.
In short, we need to keep the heat on. Black people haven't learned the difference between elections and governing
We can’t afford a President who tells us the best way to help the poor is not to talk about them, or who says its dangerous to disagree with hi him. The last President who said that kept empty li secret lists of his enemies, and tried to turn the Constitution upside down.
In short, we need to continue the battle ""to set at liberty those who are oppressed."" That has been the slogan of the Black church from its founding until today. It must continue to be yours tomorrow.

The gospel of Jesus Christ was known among African people by the end of the 2nd century, long before it was extended North and East of the basin of the Mediterranean Sea. The noted scholar, Nathan Irvin Huggins, writes of how the slave experience captured Christianity and made it different than it had been before.
""Africans had preconceptions about how the universe was ordered,"" Huggins writes, ""how each was linked with other beings and things, both in the time that was past as well as in the time that was yet to come. The African knew himself to be one with nature; everything about him was, like himself, a being in nature. Animals, plants and trees had spirit and life within them--even stones, houses and rivers had indwelling spirits. The force of creation had caused them all--was in them all--and those who passed beyond the living left a spirit that abided. The African's world was intermixed with tangible and spiritual realities, which wove him into all of nature, and the present into all pasts and futures.""
4
""This was the world in which the African had found his meaning. He would rediscover himself in America as he adapted his world view to the institutions and practices he encountered. In time, most Africans would become some variety of Christian. But this European religion would be the shell their faith was to inhabit, and they would alter that religion as their spirit moved through it. There would remain an African texture and tone to Black Christianity, and some would say that the white American's religious imagination would never totally free itself of the touch of Africa.
[Hand-drawn line.]
""The great awakening of the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries opened American Protestantism to the Afro-American. Evangelists preached a gospel that put spirit and heart over mind. A person needed only to open his heart to the Holy Spirit to be saved--make himself the receptacle of divine will. . . .The Methodist and Baptist denominations most affected this gospel. In their relatively loose and democratic structures, and in their unashamed acceptance
5
of spirit and emotionalism, they were the most hospitable to Afro- Americans. . . . The white congregants, whoever, were seldom pleased with Black membership in their churches. While admitted to their churches, Blacks were generally segregated to pews in the rear of the balcony, and sometimes were obliged to hold separate services. It was these restrictions as well as the constraints they felt in white congregations that inspired the formation of the first Afro-American churches: Silver Bluff, South Carolina, in 1773, Boston in 1808, and Philadelphia in 1816.""
""Worshipping separately, even as Christians, allowed the African tradition to linger and survive through the Black preacher, who was more exhorter than pastor. His language and style was filled with cosmic imagery, punctuated by sounds like drums rather than words--grunts and claps of hands--one voice in a chorus of voice of the congregants. The worship was not the message of one man to his flock. Rather, it was the birthing, expanding, sustaining of an atmosphere in which all worshippers were transported. It rose and intensified
6
with the preacher's words against the hums and responses of the congregation, until the spirit was palpable in their midst. The Holy Spirit moved among them and through them, possessed them, until one or another's body moved; sounds came from their mouths as if another's will were within them, making the bodies move in spasms and jerks, shaping the sounds of their shouts.
[Hand-drawn line.]
""Worship was the evoking of religious experience through the collective, rather than the individual, will. This was common in Black religious practice, more subdued perhaps in Northern and urban churches, more full and spontaneous in the plantation cabin or woods--but Africa survived in them all.
[Hand-drawn line.]
""Afro-American Christianity never lost its fundamentally collective and social character. In this, it differed from most forms of American Christianity. The typical Black Christian (however), understood all religious experience to be generated by the community at worship; the congregation and the meeting were all-important.
""The prayers of Black Christians were less likely to be supplications upward to authority than they were to be directed both
7
outward and inward to establish the unity of spirit with self, and to be one in the body of God.
""The most common and fervent prayer was 'Come Jesus, come Lord. Be among us now.' Black Christians talked as intimates with the Lord and Old Testament characters -- Brother Moses, Sister Mary, Brother Jonah. To become Christian meant to join that extended family.""2
When the slaves wanted somewhere to meet, half-free and partially protected, they chose the church. When the first schools for freedmen were established, their founders chose the church. Whenever Black people wanted sanctuary, and safety, and independence from the pervasive white world around them, they chose the church. When a white Georgia peanut farmer wanted to make himself ""all right"" with the Black folks, he chose the church.
Yet even this institution can stand some suggestion, can stand some friendly push toward greater glory in service of God to man. If there ever was a time when we needed that service, that time is now. Let me put you in the picture we see painted tighter and
8
tighter around us.
For most Black Americans, the first three hundred and fifty years on American soil have been the hardest. We got here before the Mayflower did, and that's the last time we've been ahead of anybody for anything. From the days when someone owned us to the days where we own little or nothing, things seem not to have changed much at all. Go back, if you will, not three hundred and fifty years, but back to the beginning of the twentieth century.
When the year 1900 rolled around, Black people were slaves in every way but legally. Most of us could not vote. Nearly all of us went to segregated schools, and in the South, for only a few months each year. Most of us could not hope to become educated beyond high school. Most of us worked from can to can't, if we were lucky to work at all.
By 1970, much of this had changed, and changed for the better. Most of us had escaped the farm for the city. Most of us are now
9
able to vote, even if we choose not to do so. Most of our children now go to schools that are integrated by law, if segregated by fact. We have become doctors, lawyers, teachers, office holders--have spread ourselves across the entire spectrum of American employment.
Yet even this progress is deceptive. In 1971, we were ten per cent of the workers of America, but only one percent of the engineers, only two percent of the doctors, only three percent of the managers and administrators, only six percent of the craftsmen, as contrasted with seventeen percent of the service workers, twenty percent of the laborers, and fifty percent of the household workers. And we have always been twice as many of those who have had no job at all.
In those seventy years, we moved from the back of the bus to the front of the unemployment line, from the small town South to the unfriendly North, from the cotton field to the welfare rolls. Along the way, from the bosom of the church there sprung a mighty movement, responsible today for the gains we now enjoy. That movement seems to sag now, sadly because some of us may believe that we don't
10
need it any more. Nothing could be further from the truth. Now, more than ever, we need the moral power and the spiritual vision that the church has given us. We need it in our churches and in the streets, in the pulpit and at the polling place.
Nearly two decades now have elapsed since the reluctant dawn of still another era for Black Americans. 1960 marked the beginning of a tumultuous time when old dreams, and new dreamers would flourish or die, when swift, often violent upheaval would challenge the nation's two-hundred-year old policy of ""separate but never equal.""
It began as a conservative time, the celebration of the status quo, when young men and women who called themselves ""Black"" invited the scorn of their elders who were still fighting to be called Negroes with a capital ""N"". If our history was not familiar to the nation, our status was painfully clear. We were a people whose passage to these shores had been described as ""one long line of blood, with tossing limbs and the echoing cries of death and pain."" We had been declared a problem--by the same group who created the ""problem,"" and then neglected to develop a solution.
11
It was a landmark year for young Blacks; the question ""where were you when they marched in the streets"" would become as much a part of the national Black litany as a recitation of one's whereabouts at the moment of the murders of John and Robert Kennedy, or the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King.
To millions of Black teenagers today, the sit-ins, lie-ins and marches, the hoses, cattle prods and jails, the fractured skulls and shallow graves that marked the bloody sixties are already distant history, replete with revisionism and indistinguishable from television docu-drama. To Black adults, the ""protests"" symbolized a passing of the torch, an unorthodox extension of the struggle long waged through traditional channels--the NAACP, churches, voter's leagues, and ""sitting up"" with the white folks.
It was true that Black people had progressed since our arrival in 1620 on the inhospitable shores of the newly-stolen land. We were no longer bartered and used like plows and bags of seed. We were better off than the four million freed at Emancipation who
12
set about to raise their families and make a living without skills or money, or land. We had survived Reconstruction, Jim Crow, lynch law, disenfranchisement, discrimination, segregation, several depressions, and two great wars.
Through it all, we had struggled to climb out of degradation, poverty, illiteracy; to get--and keep--a decent job, and to insure a better life for our children. And in 1960, when a new President asked what we could do for our country, the answer was soon forthcoming.
Setting aside intellectual discussion in favor of organization, young Blacks tested political theory with their feet. Dialectic took a back seat to a lunch counter sit-in, to drinking from a certain water fountain; to riding the bus in the seat of our choice, and registering to vote for the candidate of our choosing. Lives were changed, and some were lost, along the way. Mrs. Fannie Lou Hamer, whose death earlier this year was not so much from disease as from living and fighting for human rights in Mississippi, summed it up when she said, ""We didn't come for no two seats, ' cause all of us
13
is tired'.""
The nation was changed along the way, grudgingly, painfully. Not a sector has gone unaffected: federal money flows in new directions; Blacks hold office in formerly white enclaves; bureaucracies proliferate; lawsuits, rulings and legislation abound; quotas sprout at every hand; experts and scholars monitor, interpret and predict our activity.
Because our lives change so rapidly in some ways, yet remain so stagnant in others, it is imperative that we pause to review our condition. Federal figures provide a statistical measuring stick:
We are eleven percent of the population, or 23.4 million people. Our numbers have doubled since 1940; although our birth rate is going down, we are growing at a faster rate than whites. 53% of all Black people live in the South, although nearly one-and-a-half million migrated North and West since 1960. 76% of us live in metropolitan areas, with 13.7 million living in central cities. Our life expectancy has doubled since 1900, although a Black boy born in 1974 can expect to live only 62.9 years, while white boys will
14
live six years more. Our infant and maternal death rates continue to go down, although three Black women still die in childbirth for every white one. We are more likely to be homicide or suicide victims. Our illiteracy has dropped, but at a slower rate than whites.
Unemployment rates have climbed for Blacks, but more than nine million of us held jobs in 1975, nearly fifty percent more than in 1960. In that year, when the median income for Black families was $3233., 46% of us earned less than $3,000, and fewer than one percent earned more than $15,000. By 1975, the median income for Black families had risen to $9321., while 11% of us remained below the $3,000. level, and more than 26% earned over $15,000. While our median income is only 65% of what white people earned, we are ten percent closer to wage equality than in 1960. Nearly one of two Black women are employed, but more than 54% of all working Black mothers with children under 18 live below the poverty level, compared to only 34% of white women with children under 18.
Unemployment among Black teenagers reached a shocking 40%
15
during October of last year, twice the rate seven years ago. One of every three Black people continue to live below the poverty level, as compared with one out of every ten whites. 63% of poor Black families now are headed by women. Nearly four million Black children live in poverty, of whom one-third live with only one parent, on less than $3,000. a year, on welfare, and inadequate diets, and in substandard housing. Welfare dollars counted for one of every eight dollars of the Black woman's income, compared to one of every fifty dollars for white women.
The government tells us that Blacks now own nearly as many television sets as white do and as many refrigerators--but we put less in them--Black people eat 200 fewer calories worth of food per day than white people do.
Nearly all children, Black and white alike, are enrolled in elementary school, but only one of every 33 recipients of the doctorate degree in 1975 was Black. One out of four white youth old enough are enrolled in college, but only little more than one out of six Blacks,
16
while enrollment of Blacks in professional schools remains at less than five percent.
In the meantime, as we are lulled to sleep by the unfamiliar sound of federal dollars--our tax dollars--flowing into pockets and programs, and we may be tempted to relax in our comparative affluence and anticipate an oncoming golden age. Self-congratulation is premature and complacency is self-delusion. While we struggled to raise ourselves over the ""mudsill level,"" the nation's economy turned from the industrial to the post-industrial stage, from lavish affluence launched on borrowed capital and a foreign war, to a floundering, debt-ridden post-affluent society.
Through all this change, there has remained the central problem, the problem the late Dr. W.E.B. DuBois called ""the greater problem, which obscures the basic one--the problem of the color line--the fact that so many civilized persons are willing to live in comfort even if the price of this is poverty, ignorance and disease of the majority of their fellow man; that to maintain this privilege men have waged war--and the excuse for this war continues largely to be color and race.""
17
What had happened to us then is that we are like a people on a see-saw. We go up in one direction, and down in another.
It doesn't matter if you can sit in the front of the bus if you've got no place to go. It doesn't matter if you have the right to vote, if you have to choose between Tweedledum and Tweedledee. It doesn't matter if the schools are integrated, if your children are bussed from one ignorant academy to another. It doesn't matter if you can sit down at the lunch counter, if you've got a champagne appetite and a coca-cola pocketbook.
A few days ago, Vernon Jordan, the Executive Director of the National Urban League, attracted the attention of the nation when he told the President of the United States that we were sick and tired of being sick and tired. He didn't say anything new. And he didn't say anything wrong. He said what a lot of you have been thinking to yourselves, and what a few people have been whispering, but he said it out loud, and a lot of people listened. And a lot of people said ""Amen.""
They said ""Amen"" when they heard that 91% of the Black
18
people who voted last November 2nd voted for the Carter-Mondale team. They said ""Amen"" when they heard that those voters gave the Democrats a solid win in thirteen states, 13 states whose electoral votes gave the winning team 216 of the 270 electoral votes they needed to send Gerry Ford back to playing golf. They said ""Amen"" when they heard that the time is now for some payback.
What we all need to be about, now, as 1977 slides slowly away, is the rebuilding of the old movement that made it possible for the grandsons of slaves to put the grandson of a slaveowner in the White House. The people in your churches need jobs, but they aren't getting them. The people in your churches need safe homes to live in, but they aren't getting them. The people in your churches need welfare reform, not cutbacks and cutoffs. They need an energy package, not more money for the oil companies.
We can't afford in the future to vote for a candidate just because he knows the words in our hymns, and not the numbers on our
19
paycheck. We can't afford to balance the budget when our pocketbooks are upside down and empty. We can't afford to vote for anyone because we like him; the question is, does he like us? And Why? We can't afford human rights in Russia and burned out cities at home. We can't afford a few new Black faces in Washington's high places if it means no jobs for you and me. We can't afford a President who tells us the best way to help the poor is not to talk about them, or who says it's dangerous to disagree with him. The last President who said that, kept secret lists of his enemies, and tried to turn the Constitution upside down.
In short, we need to continue the battle ""to set at liberty those who are oppressed."" That has been the slogan of the Black church from its founding until today. It must continue to be yours tomorrow.

Let me speak to you today as a politician to laymen, as a man who is involved in the world of power, to men and women whose lives are lived in the world of God.
But if Jesus Christ was concerned for the whole person in the whole community, there can be no separation between us. That ""vision includes the institutions of governments of the people committed to peaceful co-existence and self-determination for all races and cultural groups, universal human rights--including the right of revolution for just cause, equal justice, the fair and equitable distribution of wealth, the protection of the weak and helpless, and the fostering of human fulfillment by the enhancement of culture and religion."" 1
If Christ did say ""The spirit of the Lord is upon me to
2
set at liberty those who are oppressed,"" then the Black church has felt that spirit too. No historian can set down on paper the totality of what the Black church and its leaders--the preachers, pastors, laymen and deacons--have meant to us.
No scribe can record the fiery words spoken from pulpit after pulpit. No list can ever count the thousands who received not just religious and moral, but political instruction in thousands of God's houses scattered in every town and village and city where we are. No bank can hold the money raised to educate our children, to protect the weak, to shore up the strong, to finance schools and homes for a people who by themselves, had only pennies to spend. No roll on this earth will ever carry all the names of lives salvaged, of families begun, of souls saved by the Black church.
No other institution touches so many of us so often. Believer and doubter, we are enveloped by the church and her works. Her buildings shelter us. Her leaders guide us, and her teachings keep us on the straight and narrow path.

""Worship was the evoking of religious experience through the collective, rather than the individual, will. This was common in Black religious practice, more subdued perhaps in Northern and urban churches, more full and spontaneous in the plantation cabin or woods--but Africa survived in them all.
""Afro-American Christianity never lost its fundamentally collective and social character. In this, it differed from most forms of American Christianity. The typical Black Christian (however), understood all religious experience to be generated by the community at worship; the congregation and the meeting were all-important.
""The prayers of Black Christians were less likely to be supplications upward to authority than they were to be directed both
7
outward and inward to establish the unity of spirit with self, and to be one in the body of God.
""The most common and fervent prayer was 'Come Jesus, come Lord. Be among us now.' Black Christians talked as intimates with the Lord and Old Testament c haracters--Brother Moses, Sister Mary, Brother Jonah. To become Christian meant to join that extended family."" 2
When the slaves wanted somewhere to meet, half-free and partially protected, they chose the church. When the first schools for freedmen were established, their founders chose the church. Whenever Black people wanted sanctuary, and safety, and independence from the pervasive white world around them, they chose the church. When a white Georgia farmer wanted to make himself ""all right"" with the Black folks, he chose the church.
Yet even this institution can stand some suggestion, can stand some friendly push toward greater glory in service of God to man. If there ever was a time when we needed that service, that time is now. Let me put you in the picture we see painted tighter and
8
tighter around us.
For most Black Americans, the first three hundred and fifty years on American soil have been the hardest. We got here before the Mayflower did, and that's the last time we've been ahead of anybody for anything. From the days when someone owned us to the days where we own little or nothing, things seem not to have changed much at all. Go back, if you will, not three hundred and fifty years, but back to the beginning of the twentieth century.
When the year 1900 rolled around, Black people were slaves in every way but legally. Most of us could not vote. Nearly all of us went to segregated schools, and in the South, for only a few months each year. Most of us could not hope to be educated beyond high school. Most of us worked from can to can't, if we were lucky to work at all.
By 1970, much of this had changed, and changed for the better. Most of us had escaped the farm for the city. Most of us are now
9
able to vote, even if we choose not to do so. Most of our children now go to schools that are integrated by law, if segregated by fact. We have become doctors, lawyers, teachers, office holders--have spread ourselves across the entire spectrum of American employment.
Yet even this progress is deceptive. In [1971] 1979, we were ten 13 per cent of the workers of America, but only one percent of the engineers, only two percent of the doctors, only three percent of the managers and administrators, only six percent of the craftsmen, as contrasted with seventeen percent of the service workers, twenty percent of the laborers, and fifty percent of the household workers. And we have always been twice as many of those who have had no job at all.
In those seventy 80 years, we moved from the back of the bus to the front of the unemployment line, from the small town South to the unfriendly North, from the cotton field to the welfare rolls. Along the way, from the bosom of the church there sprung up a mighty movement, responsible today for the gains we now enjoy. That movement seems to sag now, sadly because some of us may believe that we don't
10
need it any more. Nothing could be further from the truth. Now, more than ever, we need the moral power and the spiritual vision that the church movement has given us. We need it in our churches and in the streets, in the pulpit our schools and at the polling place.
Nearly two decades now have elapsed since the reluctant dawn of still another new era for Black Americans. 1960 marked the beginning of a tumultuous time when old dreams, and new dreamers would flourish or die, when swift, often violent upheaval would challenge the nation's two-hundred-year old policy of ""separate but never equal.""
It began as a conservative time, the celebration of the status quo, when young men and women who called themselves ""Black"" invited the scorn of their elders who were still fighting to be called Negroes with a capital ""N"". If our history was not familiar to the nation, our status was painfully clear. We were a people whose passage to these shores had been described as ""one long line of blood, with tossing limbs and the echoing cries of death and pain."" We had been declared a problem--by the same group who created the ""problem,"" and then neglected to develop a solution.
11
It was a landmark year for young Blacks; the question ""where were you when they marched in the streets"" would become as much part of the national Black litany as a recitation of one's whereabouts at the moment of the murders of John and Robert Kennedy, or the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King.
To millions of Black teenagers today, the sit-ins, lie-ins and marches, the hoses, cattle prods and jails, the fractured skulls and shallow graves that marked the bloody sixties are already distant history, replete with revisionism and indistinguishable from television docu-drama. To Black adults, the ""protests"" symbolized a passing of the torch, an unorthodox extension of the struggle long waged through traditional channels--the NAACP, churches, voter's leagues and ""sitting up"" with the white folks.
It was true that Black people had progressed since our arrival in 1620 on the inhospitable shores of the newly stolen land. We were no longer bartered and used like plows and bags of seed. We were better off than the four million freed at Emancipation who
12
set about to raise their families and make a living without skills or money, or land. We had survived Reconstruction, Jim Crow, lynch law, disenfranchisement, discrimination, segregation, several depressions, and two great wars.
Through it all, we had struggled to climb out of degradation, poverty, illiteracy; to get--and keep--a decent job, and to insure a better life for our children. And in 1960, when a new President asked what we could do for our country, the answer was soon forthcoming.
Setting aside intellectual discussion in favor of organization, young Blacks tested political theory with their feet. Dialectic took a back seat to a lunch counter sit-in, to drinking from a certain water fountain; to riding the bus in the seat of our choice, and registering to vote for the candidate of our choosing. Lives here changed, and some were lost, along the way. Mrs. Fannie Lou Hamer, whose death earlier this last year was not so much from disease as from living and fighting for human rights in Mississippi, summed it up when she said, ""We didn't come for no two seats, 'cause all of us
13
is tired'.""
The nation was changed along the way, grudgingly, painfully. Not a sector has gone unaffected: federal money flows in new directions; Blacks hold office in formerly white enclaves; bureaucracies proliferate; lawsuits, rulings and legislation abound; quotas sprout at every hand; experts and scholars monitor, interpret and predict our activity.
Because our lives change so rapidly in some ways, yet remain so stagnant in others, it is imperative that we pause to review our condition. Federal figures provide a statistical measuring stick:
We are eleven 13 percent of the population, or 23.4 million people. Our numbers have doubled since 1940; although our birth rate is going down, we are growing at a faster rate than whites. 53% of all Black people live in the South, although nearly one-and-a-half million migrated North and West 1960. 76% of us live in metropolitan areas, with 13.7 million living in central cities. Our life expectancy has doubled since 1900, although a Black boy born in 1974 can expect to live only 62.9 years, while white boys will
14
live six years more. Our infant and maternal death rates continue to go down, although three Black women still die in childbirth for every white one. We are more likely to be homicide or suicide victims. Our illiteracy has dropped, but at a slower rate than whites.
Unemployment rates have climbed for Blacks, but more than nine million of us held jobs in 1975, nearly fifty percent more than in 1960. In that year, when the median income for Black families was $3233., 46% of us earned less than $3,000, and fewer than one percent earned more than $15,000. By 1975, the median income for Black families had risen to $9321., while 11% of us remained below the $3,000. level, and more than 26% earned over $15,000. While our median income is only 65% what white people earned, we are ten percent closer to wage equality than in 1960. Nearly one of two Black women are employed, but more than 54% of all working Black mothers with children under 18 live below the poverty level, compared to only 34% of white women with children under 18.
Unemployment among Black teenagers reached a shocking 40%
15
during October of last year, twice the rate seven years ago. One of every three Black people continue to live below the poverty level, as compared with one out of every ten whites. 63% of poor Black families now are headed by women. Nearly four million Black children live in poverty, of whom one-third live with only one percent, on less than $3,000. a year, on welfare, and inadequate diets, and in substandard housing. Welfare dollars counted for one of every eight dollars of the Black woman's income, compared to one of every fifty dollars for white women.
The government tells us that Blacks now own nearly as many television sets as white do and as many refrigerators--but we put less in them--Black people eat 200 fewer calories worth of food per day than white people do.
Nearly all children, Black and white alike, are enrolled in elementary school, but only one of every 33 recipients of the doctorate degree in 1975 was Black. One out of four white youth old enough are enrolled in college, but only little more than one of six Blacks,
16
white enrollment of Blacks in professional schools remains at less than five percent.
In the meantime, as we are lulled to sleep by the unfamiliar sound of federal dollars--our tax dollars--flowing into pockets and programs, and we may be tempted to relax in our comparative affluence and anticipate an oncoming golden age. Self-congratulation is premature and complacency is self-delusion. While we struggle to raise ourselves over the ""mudsill level,"" the nation's economy turned from the industrial to the post-industrial stage, from lavish affluence launched on borrowed capital and a foreign war, to a floundering, debt-ridden post-affluent society.
Through all this change, there has remained the central problem, the problem the late Dr. W.E.B DuBois called ""the greater problem, which obscures the basic one--the problem of the color line--the fact that so many civilized persons are willing to live in comfort even if the price of this is poverty, ignorance and disease of the majority of their fellow man; that to maintain this privilege men have waged war--and the excuse for this war continues largely to be color and race.""
17
What has happened to us then is that we are like a people on a see-saw. We go up in one direction, and down in another.
It doesn't matter if you can sit in the front of the bus if you've got no place to go. It doesn't matter if you have the right to vote, if you have to choose between Tweedledum and Tweedledee. It doesn't matter if the schools are integrated, if your children are bussed from one ignorant academy to another. It doesn't matter if you can sit down at the lunch counter, if you've got a champagne appetite and a coca-cola pocketbook.
[Handwritten line drawn.]
A  few days year ago, Vernon Jordan, the Executive Director of the National Urban League, attracted the attention of the nation when he told the President of the United States that we were sick and tired of being sick and tired. He didn't say anything new. And he didn't say anything wrong. He said what a lot of you have been thinking to yourselves, and what a few people have been whispering, but he said it out loud, and a lot of people listened. And a lot of people said ""Amen.""
They said ""Amen"" when they heard that 91% of the Black
18
people who voted last November 2nd in 1976 voted for the Carter-Mondale team. They said ""Amen"" when they heard that those voters gave the Democrats a solid win in thirteen states, 13 states whose electoral votes gave the winning team 216 of the 270 electoral votes they needed to send Gerry Ford back to playing golf. They said ""Amen"" when they heard that the time is now for some payback.
What we all need to be about, now, as 19779 slides slowly away, is the rebuilding of the old movement that made it possible for the grandsons of slaves to put the grandson of a slaveowner in the White House. The people in your churches need jobs, but they aren't getting them. The people in your churches need safe homes to live in, but they aren't getting them. The people in your churches need welfare reform, not cutbacks and cutoffs. They need an energy package, not more money for the oil companies.
We can't afford in the future to vote for a candidate just because he knows the words to our hymns, and not the numbers on our paycheck.
19
paycheck. We can't afford to balance the budget when our pocketbooks are upside down and empty. We can't afford to vote for anyone because we like him; the question is, does he like us? And Why? We can't afford human rights in Russia and burned out cities at home. We can't afford a few new Black faces in Washington's high places if it means no jobs for you and me. We can't afford a President who tells us the best way to help the poor is not to talk about them, or who says it's dangerous to disagree with him. The last President who said that, kept secret lists of his enemies, and tried to turn the Constitution upside down.
In short, we need to continue the battle ""to set at liberty those who are oppressed."" That has been the slogan of the Black church from its founding until today. It must continue to be yours tomorrow.

The important message of 1977 so far is that the sunshine days are over. For nearly twenty years, a progressive national movement, fueled by the fire from the Southern civil rights struggle and the national anti-war drive, armed by legions of youth from college campus and corner pool halls, grew and prospered in the United States.
Today, in the fall of 1977, that movement is in disarray, its parts divided, its goals unclear, unable to bring itself together to confront the still massive problems of the twentieth century.
The attempt to build a society whose aim would be the democratic satisfaction of the needs of its people has faltered and nearly failed. The hopes and dreams of generations of Americans that each succeeding year would be the year in which the home of the slave finally became the land of the free have been set aside in the name of balanced budgets and corporation domination of the economy.
The process of the deterioration of the movement began in
2
1968, when that movement was at its greatest height.
It had passed two successive civil rights bills, guaranteeing Black Americans the right to public accomodations and the precious right to vote. Its lobbies and marches had convinced 50% of the American population that the war in Vietnam was wrong, and ought to be abandoned. It had nearly won important reforms in the world's oldest political party, the party that despite its worst excesses, still claimed the allegiance of the American underclass. It had aided--often unwillingly--the rebirth of the movement for equality for women. It had seen a concern grow for the quality of our air and water. It had set college campuses aflame, and indirectly, had raised public anger to set some cities on fire, too.
But beginning with the Presidential campaign of 1968, and the victory in November of that year of a candidate resurrected from political death, the movement failed its greatest test.
The newly elected President became a cheerleader for the right, his vice-President the pom-pom queen for reaction and repression. A systematic campaign was begun for the minds of middle America, and
3
was won by consistently mis-informing the population of the progress made in the years before.
Nixon and Agnew did not stand alone in these lies. Revisionists on the left contributed when they described Martin Luther King as a failure, when they embraced the barricades as fashion, not fact, when chic replaced compassion in dealing with the poor; when ""off the pig"" became their slogan instead of ""don't mourn, organize!""
The man in the middle sought safer ground, and chose as President a discredited figure in American history. Once in power he began the process of dismantling the social welfare apparatus, weak and unwieldy, that had started to cut deeply into the ranks of the permanently poor in American society.
The census tells the story starkly -- between 1960 and 1970, the numbers of Americans officially defined as poor by government statistic was reduced by nearly one-third. But, beginning in 1968, the cruel and callous castrators then in Washington moved with cold calculation to cutback, freeze, tear down and dismantle the Great
4
Society and New Frontier.
By 1972, the damage had been done. The American left, never organized and never more than a collection of organizations, most with no ideology except for a nebulous concept called ""Freedom Now"" or ""Black Power,"" dissipated into tendencies and sects. Unable to conquer the world, too many of them tried to conquer themselves with exotic diet or religion, or by foretelling each day's activities through astrological signal or postFreudian design.
In 1972, Nixon was reinstalled, and his contempt for the people was revealed for all to see. Through lies and tricks he tried to subvert the Constitution, but through luck and happenstance, was forced to retire.
The damage already had been done. A caretaker installed to finish out his term became a new Nixon in nice guy's clothes. By 1976, the people wanted something different and new, and alone among the contenders for the White House then, Jimmy Carter sensed what they wanted and gave it to them.
5
""A government as good as the people are"" was his slogan. Because we are such fools for fads, his newness captured our imagination. Because he alone understood how the process worked, he ran rings about his opposition all, except for a newer, fresher face from California who entered the race too late to make a serious mark. Because he needed to be made legitimate, he captured the attention of the Black masses, who never realized that a candidate may know the words to our hymns if not the numbers on our paychecks. Because he was conservative on some things the Wallace voters chose him. Because he was liberal on others, the liberals who had lost twice before swallowed their liberalism and grabbed ahold.
He promised no raise in Social Security taxes when he was candidate Carter, but President Carter says they must go up.
He promised parity for Blacks in his administration, but the record shows few dark faces in Washington's high places, and many who make headlines, not policy.
He promised to cut the defense budget by $15 billion dollars, but his budget cuts totaled $2.8 billion.
6
He promised an independent attorney general, free from the cabinet, with an independent term, but Griffin Bell sits on the Cabinet every time they meet.
He promised to let us know when the CIA and the FBI abused our trust, but he tried to stop the American press from telling the story of CIA payoffs to foreign heads of state.
He said that if winning jobs conflicted with fighting inflation, then inflation could have to continue, but now we hear that a balanced budget comes first.
While New York smoulders and burns, he visits Yazoo City.
He has told poor women that life is unfair, and now tells us that the best way to help the poor is not to talk about them at all.
In short, he is not evil, but he is President, not candidate now, and like all those who preceeded him in the Oval Office, is giving the squeaky wheel the most grease.
Because the powerless and the poor have stopped squeaking at all, they will continue to receive the short end of the governmental stick.
7
What is required, then, is a recreation of the vision and drive that wrote the 1960s civil rights acts in the streets of Birmingham and on the highway between Selma and Montgomery.
One important criteria for action is the discarding of the debate about the system, and whether or not to be in it. That is like telling a drowning man he shouldn't be in the water; he is, and so are we. We had better learn how to tread water, swim, or build boats, for the water rises higher every day.
You do the country -- and most important, yourself -- a great disservice when you voluntarily stand back from the great decisions being made around us.
The problems we face are immense.
The shacks and tenements from which thousands of voters poured last November to cast their votes for change must be destroyed, and habitable dwellings built in their place.
The ten million Americans unemployed must be put back to work. The list of needs goes on and on, but nowhere is it as great as among Black Americans, who are learning daily that the ability to
8
elect a president doesn't guarantee food on the table or wages in our pockets.
We are ending now the first year of America's third century as an organized nation. But for Black people, our history stretches back three hundred and fifty years beyond the birthday of the Bicentennial -- and those first three hundred and fifty years have been the hardest.
We arrived in America the year before the Mayflower, nearly the last time we placed first in anything both American and good.
Nearly twenty years have passed since the silent fifties became the activist sixties. 1960 marked the start of a tumultuous time when old dreams and new dreamers would flourish or die, when swift, often violent upheaval would challenge the established policy of separate and unequal.
It began as a conservative time, the celebration of the status quo, when young men and women bold enough to call themselves ""Black"" invited the scorn of their elders still fighting to be called
9
Negro with a capital ""N."" If our history was generally unknown, our status was painfully clear. We were a people whose passage to these shores had been called ""one long line of blood, with tossing limbs and the echoing cries of death and pain.""
1960 was a landmark year for young Blacks -- the question ""where were you when the people marched"" would become as much a part of the national Black litany as one's whereabouts during the murders of the Kennedy brothers, Malcolm X or the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King.
To millions of Americans today, whose lives and memories compete for brevity, the sit-ins, lie-ins and marches, the hoses, cattle prods and jails, the shattered skulls and shallow graves that marked the bloody sixties are already distant history, replete with revisionism and now indistinguishable from television docu-drama. To adults of that time, the protests signified a passing of the torch, an unorthodox extension of the traditional ways to better race relations -- the court suits and interracial dialogue that passed for conversation between equals.
10
There was no doubt by 1960 that the condition of American Blacks had improved since we arrived in 1620 on the unfriendly shores of this newly stolen land. We were better off than the four million freed at Emancipation who had set out to raise families and earn a living without money, skill or land. We had survived the retreat from reconstruction, lynch law, Jim Crow, several depressions, two great wars, and the witch hunts of the McCarthy era.
So, in 1960 when a youthful president asked what we could do for our country, the answer was soon forthcoming.
Setting aside discussion for action, young Blacks began to test political theory with their feet. Dialectic took a back seat to sit-ins. Lives were changed and some were lost, but a movement slowly grew from demanding twenty-five cent hamburgers at Woolworth's to insisting on an equal share of whatever it was that anyone else had.
Mrs. Fannie Lou Hamer, who died earlier this year from pursuing her own fight for human rights in Mississippi, summed it up best when she said, ""We ain't come for no two seats, 'cause all of us is tired.""
11
The nation changed too along the way, grudgingly and painfully. Not a sector of American life has gone unaffected: federal money flows in new directions; Blacks hold office where none did before; we eat, sleep, work, and study in places where ""white only"" was the rule a few years ago.
Because we change so rapidly in so many ways, and remain so stagnant in others, an occasional review is in order. Federal figures provide a statistical measuring stick.
We are eleven percent of the population, or 23.4 million people. Our numbers have doubled since 1940. Although our birth rate is going down, we still increase at a faster rate than whites. 53% of us live in the South, although nearly one and a half million migrated away since 1960. 76% of us live in metropolitan, with 13.7 million Blacks living in central cities. Life expectancy for Blacks has doubled since 1900, but a black boy born in 1974 will live six years less than a white boy born the same year. Our infant and maternal death rates decline every decade, but three Black women still
12
die in childbirth for every white one. We now earn a median income of $9,321., or 65% of the median income for whites. One of every three Black people live below the poverty line, as compared with one of every ten whites.
We now own nearly as many television sets as white people do, and nearly as many refrigerators, but we put less in them--Black people eat 200 fewer calories per day than do white people.
Only one of every 33 Americans who received a doctorate degree in 1975 was Black. One of every college age white youth are enrolled in school, but only one of every six Blacks.
Despite this dreary set of figures, too many Black people and most other Americans believe the time has come when we can relax in relative affluence and forget the hard times that went before.
The removal -- over the decade of the 1960s--of the more blatant forms of American apartheid have made it too east for too many to believe we are truly equal and free. Nothing could be further from the truth. Self-congratulation is premature, and complacency is self-delusion.
13
The central problem yet remains, the problem the late Dr. W.E.B. DuBois called ""the greater problem, which obscures the basic one, the problem of the color line, is the fact that so many civilized persons are willing to live in comfort, even if the price of this is poverty, ignorance and disease of the majority of their fellow men; that to maintain this privilege, men have waged war--and the excuse for this war continues largely to be color and race.""1
We entered the seventies after nearly ten years of progress. That progress was interrupted, but can be made to begin again. As DuBois has written: ""There is progress, and clear progress, but it is slow and gradual, and difficult to measure exactly...(but) all this will not settle the real problem of American Negroes, because that problem will still be what do we do with the increased wage, extension of education, better home surrounding, and the right to vote. What are the privileges for?
""Are we going to try to increase the wealth of the richest by climbing on the faces of the poorest among us? Are we going to

use our education for enjoyment or for service? Are our homes going to be centers of gorging and gambling entertainment or for civilization? With the right to vote, what are we going to vote for? Why are we going to vote? What kind of social organization are we going to build?""2
What we need to be about in 1977 -- and for many, many years to come -- is a version of politics which cannot be labeled by any of the old terms. To call our aspirations part of the ""new"" politics, or to label it ""radical"" or ""socialist"" is to merely put a title on a phenomenon still undergoing birth.
If there is an opening for an American era of politics different from the past, then it must be a citizen's democracy, insurgent, but with its focus seriously aimed at power.
When I speak here of ""democratic"" and ""democracy,"" I do not mean the political party presently in power, or the system of selecting government leaders as presently practiced in America; I mean the system of equally distributing wealth and power in an organized society, through institutions based on the premise that we all have equal ability -- and equal right -- to make decisions about our
15
lives and our future.
This will require the creation of a large cadre with the strategy, skill and vision to build a democratic movement in the mainstream -- a reassertion of the plain truth that ordinary women and men have the common sense and ability to control their lives, given the knowledge and the means.
The instruments involved in building such a movement are more than electoral races, as important as they can be. The lesson we ought to have learned from the sixties is this: mass movement must have an organizational base; without organizations that are stable, continuous, and mass based, the movements that do emerge eventually flounder and decay; the sixties -- in retrospect -- were merely a series of mass mobilizations, winning impressive victories and inspiring great expectations, but ultimately unable to sustain a living democracy at the base of the society.
We must develop a political program broad enough to attract a large section of the population, real enough to have some expectation of implementation, and human enough to solve the problems which we
16
have in abundance but which most Americans have in some measure.
As a beginning, let us agree on what we want: to guarantee all Americans an equal opportunity to participate in the organization of this society, and in the shaping of public and private decisions which affect their lives;
to guarantee that no one goes without the basic necessities -- food, shelter, health care, a healthy environment, personal safety, and an adequate income;
to meet our obligations to assist in the development of the world's lesser developed nations.
To meet these goals, we must move radically away from an economy where the top one percent of the population receives more income than the bottom twenty percent and the richest ten percent of the population receives the same income as the bottom fifty percent.
That is a monumental task -- its conclusion, after two-hundred years of struggle, is far from just around the corner. Let us reflect then on some words from the past, again from Dr. DuBois:
17
""We are American Negroes. It is beside the point to ask whether we form a real race. Biologically, we are mingled of all conceivable elements, but race is psychology, not biology, and psychologically we are a unified race with one history, one red memory, one revolt. It is not ours to argue whether we will be segregated or whether we ought to be a caste. We are segregated; we are a caste. Our problem is: how far and in what way can we consciously and scientifically guide our future so as to insure our physical survival, our spiritual freedom and our social growth? Either we do this or we die. There is no alternative. If America proposed the murder of our group, its moral descent into imbecility and crime and its utter loss of manhood, self-assertion and courage, the sooner we realize this the better. By that great line of McKay, 'If we must die, let it not be like hogs.' But the alternative of not dying like hogs is not that of dying or killing like snarling dogs. It is rather conquering the world by thought and brain and plan; by expression and organized cultural ideals. Therefore, let us not beat futile wings in impotent frenzy; but carefully plan and guide our segregated life, organize in industry
18
and politics to protect it and expand it.
What will be, no one knows. It may be a great physical segregation of the world along the color line; it may be an economic rebirth which insures spiritual and group integrity and physical diversity. It may be utter annihilation of class and race and color barriers in one ultimate mankind, differentiated by talent, susceptibility and gift -- but any of these ends are matters of long centuries and not years. We live in years, swift, flying, transient years. We hold the possible future in hour hands, but not by wish and will, only by thought, plan and organization.""3

The important message of 1977 so far is that the sunshine days are over.
For nearly twenty ten twenty years, a progressive national movement, fueled by the fire from the Southern civil rights struggle and the national anti-war movement drive,armed by legions of youth from college campus and corner pool halls, grew and prospered in the United States.
Today, in the fall of 1977, that movement is in dissaray, its parts divided, its goals unclear, unable to [illegible] bring itself together to confront the still massive problems of the twentieth century.
The attempt to build a society [illegible] whose aim would be the democratic satisfaction of the needs of its people has faltered and nearly failed. The hopes and dreams of generations of Americans that each succeeding year would be the year in which the [illegible] home of the slave finally became the land of the free have been set aside in the name of balanced budgets and corporate domination of the economy.
The process of the deterioration of the movement began in ] 2 1968, when that movement was at its greatest [illegible] height.
It had passed two successive civil rights bills, guaranteed Black Americans the right to public accomodations and the precious right to vote. Its lobbies and marches had convinced 50% of the American population that the war in Vietnam was wrong, and ought to be abandoned. It had [illegible] nearly won important reforms in the world's oldest political party, the party that despite its worst excesses, still claimed the allegiance of the American underclass. It had aided - often unwillingly - the rebirth of the wmovement for equality [illegible] for women. It had seen a growing concern grow for the quality of our air and water. It had set college
2
[First four paragraphs have a diagonal line through the content.]
campuses aflame, and indirectly, had raised public anger to set some cities on fire too.
But beginning with the Presidential campaign of 1968, and the victory in November of that year of a candidate ressurected from political death, the movement failed its greatest test.
The newly elected President became a cheerleader for the right, his vice-President the pom-pom queen for reaction and repression.
A systematic campaign was begun for the minds of middle America, and ] 3 was won by consistently mis-informing the population of the progress made in the years before.
Nixon and Agnew did not stand alone in these lies. Revisionists on the left contributed when they described Martin Luther King as a failure, when they embraced the barricade as fashion, not fact, when chic replaced compassion in dealing with the poor, when ""off the pig"" became their slogan instead of ""don't mourn; organize!""
The man in the middle sought safer ground, and chose as President a discredited figure in American history. Once in power, he began the process of dismantling the social welfare apparatus, weak and unwieldy, that [illegible] had started to cut deeply into the ranks of the permanently poor in American society.
The census tells the story starkly - between 1960 and 1970, the numbers of Americans officially defined as poor by the government statistic was [illegible] reduced by [illegible] nearly one-third. But beginning in 1968, the cruel and callous castrators then in Washington moved with cold calculation to cutback, freeze, tear down and dismantle the Great ] 4 Society and New Frontier.
By 1972, the damage had been done. The American left, never organized and
3
never more than a collection of organizations, most with no ideology except a nebulous concept called ""Freedom Now"" or ""Black Power"", dissapated into tendencies and sects. Unable to conquer the world, too many of us them tried to conquer ourselves themselves with exotic diet or religion, or by foretelling each day's activities through astrological signal or post-Freudian design.
In 1972, Nixon was installed again reinstalled, and his contempt for the people was revealed for all to see. Through lies and tricks he tried to subvert the Constitution, and but through luck and happenstance, was forced to retire.
But The damage already had been done. A caretaker installed to finish out his term became a new Nixon in nice's guy's clothes. By 1976, the people wanted something different and new, and alone among the contenders for the White House then, Jimmy Carter sensed what they wanted and gave it to them. ] 5
""A government as good as [they] the people are"" was his slogan. Because we are such fools for fads, his newness captured our imagination. Because he alone understood how the process worked, he ran rings about his opposition all, except for a newer, fresher face [for] from California who entered the race too late to make a serious mark. Because he needed to be made legitimate, he captured the attention of the Black masses, who never realized that [illegible] the a candidate may knows the words to our hymns if he doesn't know not the numbers on ourp paychecks. Because he was conservative on some things, the Wallace voters chose him. Because he was liberal on others, the liberals who had lost twice before swallowed their liberalism and grabbed ahold.
4
He promised no raise in Social Security taxes when he was candidate Carter, but President Carter says they must go up.
He promised parity for Blacks in his administration, but the record shows few Black dark faces in Washington's high places.,and many make headlines, not policy.
He promised to cut the defense budget by $15 billion dollars, but his budget cuts totaled $2.8. ]
He promised an independent attorney general, free from the cabinet, with an independent term, but Grffin Bell sits [with] on the Cabinet every time they meet.
He promised to let us know when the CIA and FBI abused our trust, but he tried to stop the American press from telling the story of CIA payoffs to foreign heads of state.
He said that if winning jobs conflicted with fighting inflation, then inflation would have to continue, but now we hear that a balanced budget comes first.
While New York cities city smoulders and burns, he visits Yazoo City. [Moved from three paragraphs below, per hand-drawn lines.]
He's told poor women that life xx is unfair, and now tells us that the best way to help the poor is not to talk about them at all.
In short, he he is not evil, but is President, not candidate now, and like all those who preceeded him in the oval office, is giving the squeaky wheel the most grease.
Because the powerless and the poor have stopped squeaking at all, they will continue to receive the short end of the governmental stick. ] 7
What is required, then, is a recreation of the vision and drive that wrote the 1960's civil rights acts in the streets of Birmingham and on the highway between Selma and Montgomery.
5
One important criteria for action is the [illegible] discarding of the debate about the system, and whether or not to be in it.
That is like telling a drowning man he shouldn't be in the water; he is, and so are we. We had xxxxx better learn how to tread water, swim, or build boats, for the water rises higher every day.
You do the country - and most importantly, yourselves - a great disservice when you voluntarily stand back from the great decisions being made around us.
6
The problems we face are immense ones.
The shacks and tenements from which poured thousands of voters poured last November to cast their votes for change must be destroyed, and habitable dwellings built in their place.
The 10 million American unemployed must be put back to work. The list of needs goes on and on, [illegible] but no where is x as great as among Black Americans, who are learning daily that the ability to ] 8 elect a president doesn't guarantee food on the table or wagex wages in our pockets.
Nearly twenty years have passed since the beginning of the a
We are ending now the first year of the America's third century as an organized nation. But for Black people, our history stretches back [three cen] three hundred and fifty years beyond the birthday of the Bicentennial - those first three hundred and fifty years have been the hardest.
We arrived in American the year before the Mayflower did, nearly the last time we placed first in anything both American and good.
Neearly twenty years hasve passed since the silent fifties became the activist sixties. 1960 marked the start of a tumultuous time when old dreams and new dreamers would flourish or die, when swift, often violent upheaval would challenge the established policy of separate and unequal.
It began as a conservative time, the celebration of the status quo, when young men and women bold enough to call themselves ""Black"" invited
7
the scorn of their elserd who were elders still fighting to be called ] 9 Negro with a capitol ""N"". If our history was generally unknown, our status was painfully clear. We were a people whose passage to these shores had been called ""one long line of blood, with tossing limbs and the echoing cries of death and pain.""
1960 was a land-mark year for young Blacks - the question ""where were you when the people marched"" would become as much a part of the national Black litany as one's whereabouts during the murders of the Kennedy brothers, Malcolm X or the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King.
To millions of Americans today, whs whose lives and memories compete for brevity, the sit-ins, lie-ins and marches, the hoses, cattle prods and jails, the shattered skulls and shallow graves that marked the bloody sixties are already distant history, replete with revisionism and now indistinguishable from television docu-drama. To adults of that time, the proetests signified a passing of the torch, an unorthodox extension of of the traditional ways to better race relations - the court suits and interracial dialogue that passed for conversation between equals. ] 10
There was no doubt tha by 1960, that the condition of American Blacks had improved since we arrived in 1620 on the unfriendly shores of this newly stolen land. We were better off than the 4 million freed at emancipation who had set out to raise families and earn a living without money, skill or land. We had survived the retreat from reconstruction, lynch law, Jim Crow, several depressions, two great wars, and [the] the witch hunts of the McCarthy [war] era.
So in 1960, when a youthful president asked what we could do for our
8
country, the answer was soon forthcoming.
Setting [illegible] aside discussion for action, young Blacks began to test political theory with their feet. Dialectic took a back seat to sit-ins. Lives were changed and some were lost, but a movement slowly grew from demanding twenty-five cent hamburgers at Woolworths to insisting on an equal share of whatever it was that anyone else had.
Mrs. Fannie Lou Hamer, who died earlier this year from persuing her own fight for human rights in Mississippi, summed it up best when she said ""We ain't come for no two seats, 'cause all of us is tired."" ] 11
The nation changed too along the way, grudgingly and painfully. Not a sector of American life has gone unaffected; federal money flows in new directions. Blacks hold office where none did before. We eat, sleep, work and study in places where white only was the rule a few years ago.
Because we change so rapidly in so many ways, and remain so stagnant in others, an occasional review is in order. Federal figures provide a statistical measuring stick.
We are elevn eleven per cent of the population, or 23.4 million people. Our numbers have doubled since 1940. Although our birth rate is going down, we still increase at a faster rate than whites. [illegible] 53% of us live in the South, although nearly one and a half million migrated away since 1960. 76% of us live xx in metropolitan areas, with 13.7 million Blacks living in central cities. Life expectancy for [Black] Blacks has doubled since 1900, but a black boy born in 1974 will live six years less than and white boy born the same year. Our infant and maternal death rates decline every decade, but three Black women still ] 12 die in childbirth for every white one. We xxx now earn a median income of $9,321, or 65% of the
9
median income for whites.
One of every three Black people live below the poverty line, as compared with one of every ten whites.
We now own nearly as many television sets as white people do, and nearly as many refrigerators, but we put less in them - Black people eat 200 fewer calories per day than white people do.
Only one of every 33 Americans who received a doctorate degree in 1975 was Black. One of every college age white youth are enrolled in school, but only of every six Blacks.
Despite this dreary set of figures, too many Black people and most other Americans believe the time has come when we can relax in relative affluence and forget the hard times that went before.
The removal - over the decade of the 1960s - of the more [obvious] blatant forms of American apartheid have made it too easy for too many to believe we are truly equal and free. Nothing could be further from the truth. Self-congratulation is premature, and complacency is self-delusion. ] 13
The central problem yet remains, the problem the late Dr. W. E. B. DuBois called ""the greater problem, which obscures the basic one, the problem of the color line, is the fact that so many civilised persons are willing to live in comfort, even if the price of this is poverty, ignorance and disease of the majority of their fellow men; that to maintain this priviledge, men have waged war - and the excuse for this war continues largely to be color and race."" [1]
10
We entered the seventies after nearly ten years of progress. That progress was interrupted, but can be made to begin again. As DuBois has written: ""There is progress, and clear progress, but it is slow and gradual, and difficult to measure exactly..... (but) all this will not settle the real problem of American Negroes, because that problem will still be what do we do with the increased wage, extension of education, better home surroundings, and the right to vote. What are the priviledges for?
""Are we going to try to increase the wealth of the richest [illegible] by climbing on the faces of the poorest among us? Are we going to ] 14 use our education for enjoyment or for service? Are our homes going to be centers of gorging and gambling entertainment or for civilization? With the right to vote, what are we going to vote for? Why are we going to vote? What kind of social organization are we going to build? [2]

[Typeset changes.]
best candidate is slim, primarily because we have yet to build a national confederation of interest among ourselves that can be put into alliance with others who share our concerns.
What we need to be about in [1976] 1977--and for many, many years to come--is a version of politics which cannot be labeled by any of the old terms. To call our aspirations part of the ""new"" politics, or to label it ""radical"" or ""socialist"" is to merely put a title on a phenomenon still undergoing birth.
If there is an opening for an American era of politics different from the past, then it must be a citizen's democracy, insurgent, but with its focus seriously aimed at power.
When I speak here of ""democratic"" and democracy"", I do not mean the political party presently out of in power, or the system of selecting government leaders as presently practiced in America; I mean the system of equally distributing wealth and power in an organized society, through institutions based on the premise that we all have equal ability--and equal right--to make decisions about our ] 15 lives and our future.
This will require the creation of a large cadre with the strategy, skill and vision to build a democratic movement in
11 12
the mainstream--a reassertion of the plain truth that ordinary women and men have common sense and ability to control their lives, given the knowledge and the means.
The instruments involved in building such a movement are more than electoral races, as important as they can be. The lesson we ought to have learned from the sixties is this--mass movement must have an organizational base; without organizations that are stable, continuous, and mass based, the movements that do emerge eventually flounder and decay; the sixties--in retrospect--were merely a series of mass mobilizations, winning impressive victories and inspiring great expectations, but ultimately unable to sustain a living democracy at the base of the society.
We must develop a political program broad enough to attract a large section of the population, real enough to have some expectation of implementation, and human enough to solve the problems which we ] 16 have in abundance but which most Americans have in some measure.
As a beginning, let us agree on what we want:

to guarantee all Americans an equal opportunity to participate in the organization of this society, and in the shaping of public and private decisions which affect their lives.

12 13
affect their lives.

to guarantee that none of us no one goes without the basic necessities--food, shelter, health care, a healthy environment, personal safety, and an adequate income;
to insure adequate national security against real threats from abroad, and
to meet our obligations to assist in the development of the world's lesser developed nations.

To meet these goals, we must move radically away from an economy where the top 1% of the population receives more income than the bottom 20% and the richest 10% of the population receives the same income as the bottom 50%.
That is a monumental task--its conclusion, after two hundred years of struggle, is far from just around the corner.
Let us reflect then on some words from the past, the great scholar W. E. B. again from Dr. DuBois:
""We are American Negroes. It is beside the point to ask whether we form a real race. Biologically we are mingled of all conceivable elements, but race is psychology, not biology, and psychologically we are a unified race with one history, one red memory, one revolt. It is not ours to argue whether we will be segregated or whether we ought to be a caste. We

Our problem is: how far and in what way can we consciously and scientifically guide our future so as to insure our physical survival, our spiritual freedom and our social growth? Either we do this or we die. There is no alternative.

It is rather conquering the world by thought and brain and plan; by expression and organized cultural ideals. Therefore, let us not beat futile wings in impotent frenzy; but carefully plan and guide our segregated life, organize in industry ] 18 and politics to protect it and expand it.
[Handwritten lines that seem to indicate a paragraph break.] What will be, no one knows. It may be a great physical segregation of the world along the color line; it may be an economic rebirth which insures spiritual and group integrity and physical diversity. It may be utter annihilation of class and race and color barriers in one ultimate mankind, differentiated by talent, susceptibility and gift--but any of these ends are matters of long centuries and not years.

In remarks prepared for delivery today, Georgia State Senator Julian Bond told representatives of America's college youth that the human rights movement of the 1960s ""is in dissaray, its parts divided, its goals unclear, unable to bring itself together to confront the still massive problems of the twentieth century.""
Bond was a leader of the 1960s student civil rights drive and an active participant in the anti-war movement. He has been a consistent critic of both the Carter candidacy and the eight-months old Carter administration for its ""lack of commitment to the problems of the poor.""
Bond said the '60s movement had ""passed two successive civil rights bills, convinced 50% of the American public the Vietnam war was wrong, helped reform the Democrat party, aided the rebirth of the women's movement, nurtured the ecological concerns of the decade"" but began to fall apart when Richard Nixon was elected President in 1968.
The Carter campaign of 1976 raised hopes that the movement's concerns would once again receive priority, Bond said, but those hopes ""have been set aside in the name of balanced budgets and corporate domination of the American economy.""
Bond said Black voters had been mistaken to vote for a candidate ""who knows the words to our hymns but not the numbers on our paychecks.""
Carter campaign promises to cut defense spending, to expose CIA and FBI abuses, to provide jobs for the unemployed, and to give Blacks employment parity in his administration have not been kept.
The United States National Students Association is a 30-year-old organization of student leaders and governments. In the 1960s, it provided much of the impetus for student participation in the civil rights and anti-war demonstrations.

Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania
It is a pleasure to speak pro bono before a group of people who will soon be charging me for speaking to them. Your chosen profession, more than any other, orders all our lives. People who do what you will do, will find some way to tell the rest of us what we can do, how we can do it, and when it must be done.
At their best, the Charlie Houstons, the Spotswood Robinsons, the Thurgood Marshalls, the Robert Mings, the C.B. Kings, the Howard Moores, the Donald Hollowells, the William Colemans--Black lawyers have turned Blackstone's words into Black progress as they have chipped away at privilege and prejudice and entrenched power to win the rights automatically guaranteed to everyone else.
That is hopefully the tradition you will follow, but the difficulties you will face are major ones. The Supreme Court that
2
some of you will practice before someday is a different body with different faces that the nine old men who ruled 23 years ago that separate but equal could not stand. Today's court is properly called the Nixon court. Its rightwing majority was built by a lawyer who began his political career in chicanery, who kept a slush fund as a vice-presidential candidate, who pleaded nolo to election fraud charges in his race to be California's governor, who obstructed justice and suborned perjury in the White House, and who now says that crimes committed by you and me are not crimes when committed by him.
Incidentally, the relationship between politics and the law is shown nowhere in greater example than in the current composition of this court. Richard Nixon was elected President in 1968 because one more Black voter in each Black precinct across America did not vote. Because we traditionally have been ""right on"" at the rally and left out at the ballot box, Powell, Burger, Rhenquist, and Blackmon now sit in judgement on us all.
3
They have already begun to roll back what the Warren Court had won. They have limited the right to sue, to bring class action legislation and to bring habeas corpus proceedings after a state criminal proceeding.
When Thurgood Marshall argued that the ""hearts and minds"" of Black children were irrevocably damaged by segregation in 1954, he could not dream that he might one day sit on the other side of that bar. He could never have imagined that as a Justice, he might someday write, as he did in dissenting from his colleagues in the Detroit school case in 1974: ""Racial attitudes ingrained in our nation's childhood and adolescence are not quickly thrown aside in its middle years. But just as the inconvenience of some cannot be allowed to stand in the way of the rights of others, so public opposition, no matter how strident, cannot be permitted to divert this court from the enforcement of the constitutional principles
4
at issue in this case. Today's holding, I fear, is more a reflection of a perceived public mood that we have gone far enough in enforcing the Constitution's guarantee of equal justice than it is the product of neutral principles of law. In the short run, it may seem to be the easier course to allow our great metropolitan areas to be divided up into two cities--one white, the other Black--but it is a course, I predict, our people will ultimately regret. I dissent."" 1
Marshall's complaint that the public mood had shifted, that even hallowed institutions like the court were sensitive to it, that the nation felt it had ""done enough"" could come as no surprise to any Black American. The two hundred years history of the attempt by Black Americans to integrate themselves into the American scheme is a history of ups and downs. The American law which sanctified the purchase and sale of people was based on English common law, and inherited by us from a people who believed there were ""lesser
5
breeds before the law."" The first American lawyers brought a heritage of property and profit motives to the task of framing a Constitution and shaping a government. They were easily able, therefore, to deny women any participation in public life, to exclude Native Americans from hearth and home, and to count us as three-fifths of a man in framing the Constitution.
As the nation grew, so did the law school, from its modest start at Harvard around 1816. In 1833, the estimated number of students in law school instruction numbered about 150. In 1974 alone, American law schools granted more than 33,000 degrees.
Along the way, the study of law had changed; formerly a mastery of grand legal principles, now it was an ability to negotiate and manipulate; less a treasury of principles than a set of instruments. Historians say that ""of new opportunities open after the Civil War, none was more striking than those for lawyers. Legislatures, regulatory agencies, and court systems provided forum
6
and reward.""
Meanwhile, back on the plantation and in the free community, aspiring young Blacks found ""no trespassing"" signs posted on the same fields that promised Elysian delights for their white counterparts.
In point of fact, it was not until 1826 that the first Black college graduate, John Russwurm, received his degree at Bowdoin, and not until 1845 that the first Black man formally admitted to the bar, Macon B. Allen, passed his examination. Dr. John S. Rock, physician and lawyer, became the first Black admitted to practice before the U.S. Supreme Court in 1865.
While Emancipation and the establishment of Freedmen's schools stirred the ambitions of young Black people, W.E.B. Du Bois described the conditions nearly all Blacks faced: // ""He felt his poverty; without a cent, without a home, without land, tools, or savings, he had entered into competition with rich, landed, skilled
7
neighbors. To be a poor man is hard, but to be a poor race in a land of dollars is the very bottom of hardships. He felt the weight of his ignorance--not simply of letters, but of life, of business, of the humanities; the accumulated sloth and shirking and awkwardness of decades and centuries shackled his hands and feet. Nor was his burden all poverty and ignorance. The red stain of bastardy, which two centuries of systematic legal defilement of Negro women had stamped upon his race, meant not only the loss of ancient African chastity, but also the hereditary weight of a mass of filth from white whoremongers and adulters, threatening almost the obliteration of the Negro home."" 2 \\
Years of struggle, some successes and many failures lay ahead. As recently as 1829, the state of Georgia had mandated punishment of fines, whipping, and imprisonment for any person convicted of teaching a slave or free Negro to read and write.
8
In 1850 only 1.9 percent of Black children ages five through twenty attended school; in 1870 nine-tenths of all Blacks were illiterate. By 1899, an Atlanta University conference survey reported the total number of Black college student graduates to date as only 2331. Of the 1312 graduates responding to the survey, only 4.7% listed their occupation as lawyer. One year later, former U.S. President Rutherford B. Hayes told students at Johns Hopkins University that he had been unable to find any Negroes of ability so unusual as to offer them higher training.
It is a wonder we can read and write at all, let alone practice law. A 1970 survey showed 4,000 Black lawyers, or 2% of the total number of 300,000 then practicing in the U.S., and 214 Black state and federal judges among some ten thousand judges in the nation. If any person here assembled has knowledge of the number of Black lawyers practicing in 1977, I salute you. The cautious guardians
9
of statistics, ever mindful of our sensitivities, conceal that figure; neither the National Bar Association or the Black American Law Students Association would tell my office how many Black lawyers or law students there are in America today unless I wrote them a letter requesting these facts.
Many of us believed, light years and several lifetimes ago, that all we needed was the vote, a seat in the front of the bus, a drink from a certain fountain, the right to work, or attend the school of our choice. Although those advances were substantial we are still, figuratively at least, at the back of the bus. The civil rights movement is not ended; it has moved from the street to the courthouse, from confrontation to litigation. Bright young minds have taken up what tired feet began, the struggle to secure for our children the blessings of society denied our mothers and fathers, the struggle to realize the dream deferred.
10
It is reasonable to hope that even in these cynical days a law student dreams of returning to his community to provide public service. He may have known a lawyer who helped Blacks register to vote, or who saved their farms from forfeiture to greedy landowners or swinish sheriffs. He may have known a Black lawyer who defended young men and women against outrageous, racially-motivated charges that would have resulted in harsh jail sentences or even death.
Unhappily, the aspiring law students may have observed the spectacle of the slick ""ten dollar hello"" lawyer, the courthouse clown, the ambulance chaser, or the burial insurance swindler. He may have known the occasional Black lawyer whose shabby practice of the law has helped send more young Blacks to jail than it has helped free. And he may have heard from too many of his potential clients that the white man's ice is colder, his sugar sweeter, and his medicine stronger.
11
Whatever his good intentions, the fact is, a graduating law student is more conservative, more materialistic, less idealistic than he was at matriculation. A survey of the class of 1974 at the School of Law at the University of California, Davis, supports that observation.
It notes that the proportion of students who expected to be working as ""movement"" or ""poverty"" or ""public interest"" lawyers one year after graduation dwindled from 37 percent as first year students to 22 percent as members of the third year class. It is as if the young lawyer wants to save mankind, but upon discovery that the salary in the field is too low, decides instead to save himself.
The Davis survey names the law school itself as the ultimate influence on the student, and suggests that by tradition and faculty appointment it perpetuates white male domination of the
12
profession. The study of law, I am told, concentrates on legal issues to the exclusion of issues of policy and morality. My response to that tradition, that concentration is to remind Black law students that we are where we are today, wherever that is, because of and in spite of, this system. This is the tradition of law that brought us the Constitutional Compromise, the Fugitive Slave Acts, the Dred Scott decision, the defeat of Reconstruction, Jim Crow, lynch law, chain gangs, segregation and disenfranchisement. It is the system that invests with authority men like Bull Connor, Orville Faubus, Huey Long, Lester Maddox and J. Edgar Hoover. It is the system that rewards lawyers like John Mitchell and Griffin Bell, and the most successful of all times, the man who just answered the $600,000 question, ""what's my lie"" by claiming to be a ""paranoid for peace.""
It is interesting to note that the Davis survey rated the occupation of politician very nearly the lowest of all law
13
students' aspirations. It must be with great reluctance, then, that lawyers seek elected office in such large numbers. The U.S. Congress includes 291 lawyers among its members, and of the sixteen Black members, ten are lawyers.
As a State Senator, I receive many hundreds of letters from people who need help. Some are in Georgia jails, or federal prisons or military stockade. Some need help with property, wills, custody, government agencies. They have something in common: they are poor, ignorant of legal remedies, and have limited access to the justice system. All are caught in a 200-year old, man-made, snarl of laws, regulations, procedures and customs.
I hope that you will set high priority on the task of unraveling needless complications in our legal system. I hope for the day when law and lawyers serve people rather than property; I urge you to work toward the day when lawyers serve the orphan in
14
preference to the orphanage, the prisoner rather than the prison system, and the citizen rather than the government.
It ought to be a warning to you that the one-hundred day old President of the United States drew the greatest amount of applause as a candidate when he told his audiences he was a farmer, a businessman, and nuclear engineer--and not a lawyer.
As we learned about the Watergate scandal several years ago, there was a collective sigh of racial relief when we discovered that the only Black man involved had caught the culprits in the act. For some of us, this signified some kind of high standard of racial morality although it was more likely due to the racism of the Nixon administration. I know too many of us who would have slit John Dean's throat if he could have but replaced him at Nixon's right hand.
I believe with Du Bois that: "". . . There is progress, and clear progress, but it is slow and gradual, and difficult to
15
measure exactly . . . (but) all this will not settle the real problem of American Negroes, because that problem will still be what we do with the increased wage, extension of education, better home surroundings, and the right to vote. What are these privileges for?
""Are we going to try to increase the wealth of the richest by climbing on the faces of the poorest among us? Are we going to use our education for enjoyment or for service? Are our homes going to be centers of gorging and gambling entertainment or for civilization? With the right to vote, what are we going to vote for? Why are we going to vote? What kind of social organization are we going to build? . . . We realize that human advance is long, slow, and tedious, with periods of acceleration and stoppage, even of retrogression: undoubtedly, now and again, the world falls backward. We will realize that the inner core of the problem of American Negroes is not discrimination but a question of ideal and ability. Discrimination
16
hinders the formation of ideals and the emerging of ability. But the doing away with discrimination will never settle these matters--rather it opens the way for us to face the real problems of life . . .
""Negroes in the United States, being on the one hand American, and on the other hand members, more or less integrated, of the Negro group, . . . May think of their preferment chiefly as their personal accomplishment and therefore as a chance to escape unpleasant enfironment and hateful conditions. They may look upon their careers as American, not Negro; withdrawing themselves from the Negro group as far as possible.
""If they do this, they will fail to recognize how much that cultural group has meant to them, how tremendously it has inspired them to effort and how a large sum has been given by poor unlettered Black folk to the education and training of outstanding young men and women. . . . repayment for this cannot be made to
17
persons and organizations, but it can be made by extending opportunities for other persons within the Negro group and without to find themselves and to gain recognition for unborn talent. Considerable as is the number of Negroes who have reached recognized accomplishment, we must remember that the great mass of talent among us (is) still hidden and buried by the lack of education, encouragement, and opportunity."" 3
I submit that this group and all concerned Black people today can make no higher commitment than this: to dedicate all our strength to the recognition and encouragement of the ideals and abilities of our people, in order to create what may be our last alternative in America.

He may have known a Black lawyer who defended young men and women against outrageous, racially-motivated charges that would have resulted in harsh jail sentences or even death. 
Unhappily, the aspiring law student may have observed the spectacle of the slick “ten dollar hello” lawyer, the courthouse clown, the ambulance chaser, or the burial insurance swindler. He may have known the occasional Black lawyer whose shabby practice of the law has helped send more young Blacks to jail than it has helped free. And he may have heard from too many of his potential clients that the white man’s ice is colder, his sugar sweeter, and his medicine stronger. 
11
Whatever his good intentions, the fact is, a graduating law student is more conservative, more materialistic, less idealistic than he was at matriculation. A survey of the class of 1975 at the School of Law at the University of California, Davis, supports that observation. 
It notes that the proportion of students who expected to be working as “movement” or “poverty” or “public interest” lawyers one year after graduation dwindled from 37 percent at first year students to 22 percent as members of the third year class. It is as if the young lawyer wants to save mankind, but upon discovery that the salary in that field is too laow, decided instead to save himself. 
The Davis survey names the law school itself as the ultimate influence on the student, and suggests that by tradition b and faculty appointment it perpetuates white male domination of the ] 12 profession. The study of law, I am told, concentrates on legal 
12
issues to the exclusion of issues of policy and morality. My response to that tradition, that concentration is to remind Black law students that we are where we are today, wherever that is, because of and in spite of, this system. This is the tradition of law that brought us the Constitutional Compromise, the Fugitive Slave Acts, the Dred Scott decision, the defeat of Reconstruction, Jim Crow, lynch law, chain gains, segregation and disenfranchisement. It is the system that invests with authority men like Bull Connor, Orville Faubus, Huey Long, Lester Maddox and J. Edgar Hoover. It is the system that rewards lawyers like John Mitchell and John Dean Griffin Bell, and the most successful of all times, the man who just answered the $600,000 question, “what’s my lie” by claiming to be a paranoid for peace. 
It is interesting to note that the Davis survey rated the occupation of politician very nearly the lowest of of all law ] 13 student’s aspirations. It must be with great reluctance, then, that lawyers seek elected 
13
office in such large numbers. The U.S. Congress includes 291 lawyers among its members, and of the sixteen Black members, ten are lawyers. 
As a State Senator, I receive many hundreds of letters from people who need help. Some are in Georgia jails, or federal prisons or military stockades. Some need help with property, wills, custory, government agencies. They have something in common: they are poor, ignorant of legal remedies, and have limited access to the justice system. All are caught in a 200-year old, man-made, snarl of laws, rules, regulations, procedures and customs. 
I propose that the profession set hope that you will set high priority on the task of unraveling needless complications in our legal system. I hope for the day when the law and lawyers serve people rather than property; I urge you to work toward the day when lawyers serve the orphan in ] 14 preference to the orphanage, the prisoner rather than the prison system, and the citizen rather than the government. 
14
It ought to be a warning to you that the 100-day old President of the United States drew the greatest amount of applause as a c candidate when he told his audiences he was a farmer, a businessman, and nuclear engineer--and not a lawyer. 
As we learned about the Watergate scandal several years ago, there was a collective sigh of racial relief when we discovered that the only Black man involved had caught the culprits in the act. For some of us, this signified some kind of high standard of racial morality although it was more likely due to the racism of the Nixon administration. I know too many of us who would have slit John Dean’s throat if he could have but replaced him at Nixon’s right hand. 
I believe witk with DuBois that: 
""… there is progress, and clear progress, but it is slow and gradual, and difficult to ] 15 measure exactly… (but) all this will not settle the real problem of American Negroes, because that problem will still be what we do with the increased wage, extension 
15
of education, better home surroundings, and the right to vote. What are these privileges for? 
""Are we going to try increase the wealth of the richest by climbing on the faces of the poorest among us? Are we going to use our education for enjoyment or for service? Are our homes going to be centers of gorging and gambling entertainment or for civilization? With the right to vote, what are we going to vote for? Why are we going to vote? What kind of social organization are we going to build? … We realize that human advance is long, slow, and tedious, with periods of acceleration and stoppage, even of retrogression; undoubtedly, now, and again, the world falls backward. We will realize that the inner core of the problem of American Negroes is not discrimination but a question of ideal and ability. Discrimination ] 16 hinders the formation of ideals and the emerging of ability. But the doing away with discrimination will never settle these matters--rather, it opens the way for us to face the real problems of life… 
16
""Negroes in the United States, being on the one hand American, and on the other hand members, more or less integrated, of the Negro group, may … may think of their preferment chiefly as their personal accomplishment and therefore as a chance to escape unpleasant environment and hateful conditions. They may look upon their careers as American, not Negro; withdrawing themselves from the Negro group as far as possible. 
""If they do this, they will fail to recognize how much that cultural group has meant to them, how tremendously it has inspired them to effort and how a large a sum has been given by poor unlettered black folk to the education and training of outstanding young men and women… Repayment for this cannot be made to ] 17 persons and organizations, but it can be made by extending opportunities for other persons within the Negro group and without to find themselves and to gain recognition for unborn talent. Considerable as is the number of Negroes who have 
17
reached recognized accomplishment, we must remember that the great mass of talent among (us) still hidden and buried by the lack of education, encouragement, and opportunity."" (WEBD reader 328)
. . . .
I submit that this group and all concerned Black people today can make no higher commitment than this: to employ dedicate all our strength in to the recognition and encouragement of the ideals and abilities of all Black our people, for then we in order to create what may be our last alternative in America.

If its true that funerals are for the living, then we are here to learn from Mrs. Hamer's life, how we can make our lives — and our children's — better than they were meant to be.
Her life was service to others. It was unselfish service. Her biography in your program tells her story — a losing fight against death, but a winning fight against Mississippi, against American apartheid, against the viciousness called the Southern Way of Life, against lies and evil and poverty and powerlessness.
She leaves behind family and friends, who love her and will miss her. We should pray for them.
Here in Ruleville she leaves behind a community she lived in and made better. We should carry on that work.
In the world, she leaves behind an idea, a little light, the little light she wanted to shine.
We will remember her in stories we will tell, happy stories and sad ones too.
Her life is summed up in the program in words and numbers. The numbers say 1917 (dash) 1977.
Years separated by a mark on paper — you can read it in a minute, only sixty seconds in it, but those sixty years were years of life.
We must make that life go on.
When Fannie Lou Hamer was 4 years old, without knowing her or what she would become W. E. B. DuBois wrote:
""Some few women are born free, and some amid insult and scarlet letters have acheive freedom; but our women in Black had freedom thrust contemptously upon them. With that freedom they are buying an untrammeled independence and dear as is the price they will pay for it, it will in the end be worth every taunt and groan. Today the dreams of the mothers are coming true. We still have our poverty and deprivation, our lewdness and our cruel toil; but we have, too, a vast group of women of Negro blood who for strength of character, cleaness of soul, and unselfish devotion of purpose, is today easily the peer of any group of women in the civilised world. And more than that, in the great rank and file of our five million women we have the up-working of new revolutionary ideals, which must in time have vast influence on the thought and action of the land.""*
Mother's dreams seldom do come true, but this warrior woman from Ruleville acted hers out, and in doing so, shamed others to do the same.
Fannie Lou Hamer was articulator for the Southern movement. She had been a time-keeper on Senator Eastland's a plantation in Sunflower County plantation, fired because she registered to vote. She became the organizer, energizer, spokesperson, worker, traveler, candidate, mother of the movement for political independence for Black Mississippians, and lived to see some changes in the life Senator Eastland had intended for her.
She was brutally beaten and brutalised, involuntarily sterilised unknowingly by a doctor who believed he was doing this Black woman a favor, keeping her from bringing more children into a miserable world.
She died not so much of cancer, but of living and fighting in rural Mississippi in the 20th Century; her husky voice as a singer or a teller will be remembered a long time. She lent her name to good causes, and her tired body to too many more.
A President of the United States, Lyndon Johnson, knowing better than she how persuasive moving she might be, conspired to keep her from telling a national television audience how she'd been beaten ""'til I swole up!""
When summer soldiers abandoned Ruleville and the rural South, she shell shocked by too much of what was daily life for her, she stayed on. It was her home. She believed it was and could be a good place to live, and she died trying to make it so.
Some people thought they'd ""discovered"" Mrs. Hamer, they way singers entertainers were discovered by talent scouts looking for something new.
But Mrs. Hamer discovered herself, celebrated herself, lived for herself and her peoples, and died [illegible] because she could not stop trying.
She like liked to sing ""this little light of mine, I'm going to make it shine, make it shine, make it shine, make it shine.""
Her light has gone out, but we [illegible] shall be [illegible] warmed yet by the glow.

I realize that my request was made after the informal deadline which you had set, and that by permitting me to come you lengthened what have been extended and difficult hearings, and I appreciate your generosity.
I am not here today to recite to you what I have or have not done in the last [four] few years, or to ask that you accept me on the basis of my experiences as an expert on judging the racial attitudes of white men. I do not purport to speak for the black community, the civil rights community, or anyone else who isn't here. I do not purport merely because I live in the south, to be any more expert about judging the views and character of Southerners than the men and women from Pennsylvania, Michigan, or New York.
I am here today only as Julian Bond of Atlanta, Georgia, to express my personal views and hopes regarding how this Committee will handle the difficult and important task of weighing the nomination of Judge Bell.
I am particularly concerned about the Committee's responsibilities for resolving the clear factual dispute regarding the role Judge Bell played during the Vandiver years. The question is squarely presented by the evidence you have heard. There are those who claim that Judge Bell was actively working within the Vandiver administration to persuade the Governor and others that they must obey the law and directions of the Supreme Court, that they must voluntarily, and promptly integrate the public schools, colleges, and other segregated state institutions. There are others who claim that Judge Bell was the architect of massive resistence in Georgia, that he played a role in fashioning a variety of segregationist bills and measures, that he helped the administration prevent, minimize, and above all delay the integration which the Supreme Court had commanded occur without further postponement. That is the factual issue which must be decided, and it is you who must decide it. The issue is vital, not only for what it says about Judge Bell's racial views in 1960, but because, if the version of the facts advanced by his opponents is correct, Judge Bell was not honest and candid with this Committee.
I cannot tell you the answer to the question. I, like almost all the other witnesses you have heard, have no personal knowledge of what Judge Bell did in 1958-61. The only people who really know what occurred are the men who sat in the inner councils of the Vandiver administration. No member of the Senate, with the possible exception of Senator Talmadge, have personal knowledge of what occurred in those councils in the early sixties.
What I personally know is limited to the consequences of the policies in 1958-61. Every public school and college in the state of Georgia . T , the cafeteria at the state capitol of Georgia was segregated. There was open and notorious discrimination in employment against blacks by every state agency. It was difficult if not impossible for a black man or woman to register to vote in Georgia outside of Atlanta. I was personally arrested for seeking service at an all-white cafeteria in the Atlanta City Hall. Every intelligent lawyer in Georgia, black or white, knew that this was illegal. It was as unequivocally unlawful as any of the forms of misconduct forbidden by the statutes of the Constitution of the United States. I don't know [illegible] what part Judge Bell played in this pattern of deliberate defiance of the law by the officials of Georgia. That is for you to decide. But any man who gave aid or comfort to those who were knowingly violating the constitutional rights of thousands of blacks, and any man who would be other than totally candid with you about his actions in those years, does not merit your approval to serve as Attorney General of the United States.
The Committee thus sits, in a very real since sense as a jury acting on behalf of both the Senate and the people of the United States. We are looking to you to give us the careful unhurried and detailed analysis of which you are capable. Whatever the outcome of your deliberations, both public confidence and Judge Bell are entitled to a thorough and painstaking decision and report, which resolves the factual questions which now trouble the country and your colleagues. This is not a committee matter which can be resolved by a quick committee vote and some staff writing. Each member of this committee should personally review the testimony and other evidence, withholding judgement until the consequences of that thorough analysis become evident.
The responsibility to resolve this factual issue is yours alone. Neither Julian Bond nor Andy Young nor Jimmy Carter can decide the matter. For only you have sat here four days and heard the evidence. Only you have watched the witnesses and observed their demeanor. And only you will be accountable to your consciences and the country if you fail to carefully analyze the evidence, to proceed with caution, and to pronounce the judgement which the evidence compels without regard to politics or patronage, to Ifriendship or favoritism.
Thisat this responsibility should fall on you is consonant with the procedures contemplated by the Constitution and the Senate rules. When President-elect Carter selected Mr. Bell he did not know, and could not have known, most of the evidence that has been presented to you. That is not fault of Mr. Carter's , but inherent in the process by which anyone is nominated for office. The interval between nomination and confirmation and the cautious deliberative role of the Senate were intended by the framers of the Constitution to allow witnesses, documents and controversies to emerge. All that has happened in this case. The procedures of the Senate properly place upon each of its committees a special duty to help resolve questions of facts bearing on the decisions that the Senate must make. The committee members alone can observe the demeanor of witnesses and, in most cases, they alone have the time to review the sort of complex and conflicting record that exists with regard to Judge Bell's role in the Vandiver years.
The problems before you bear a certain relation to the difficulties faced by the House Judiciary Committee. I have some experience in political office, and I am fully aware of the real and reasonable political problems caused by the Bell controversy. Those of us who appeared as witnesses, however we have testified, are aware of the political consequences of involvement in this matter. The consequences and pressures of which we are aware at this side of the table are equally present on your side; the only difference is that we volunteered for trouble, whereas you had trouble thrust upon you. We all know that any decision which you reach will be unpopular with constituents or executive officials on whose support you must depend on to do your job and get re-elected. Those are the realities of the world in which you and I work, and are, within reasonable limits, not improper. I cannot assure you that, however you vote, your vote will not be costly for you politically. But I do believe that you will find, as the members of the House Judiciary Committee discovered in November 1974, that if you make your best effort to determine the facts, without regard to fear of reprisal or hope of reward, the political price of your decision, whatever it may be, will be substantially smaller.
Resolving the conflicting evidence will not, I know, be easy. You must compare the recollections of the witnesses with the documentary evidence in the record. You must assess whether Judge Bell, both in what he said and how he said it, was a credible witness. You must decide, from Mr. Cochrane's testimony, whether Judge Bell was merely furnishing him with information or was advancing Governor Vandiver's policy of trying to persuade blacks to shrink from asking for the rights guaranteed by the United States Constitution. You must weigh all the evidence in the light of the fact that no real integration occurred in the Georgia schools until 10 years later, and then, not by compromise and private discussion, but because integration was ordered by the federal courts. In shifting through this evidence you will, I believe, be aided by the fact that some members of this committee, like most on an ordinary jury, are non-lawyers who must rely on ordinary common sense.
In deciding this issue I hope you will remember that there were whites' in the south during the difficult years we have been discussing who stood up and openly urged that Georgia obey the law and integrate the schools, thoroughly, promptly, and without waiting for the federal courts to order it. Griffin Bell may have been one of those who did, he may have courageously told Governor Vandiver to do what Governor McKeldinKeithen had done several years earlier, to obey the law without delay. Whether Judge Bell did that is for you to decide. But we would dishonor the memory of those who bravely fought for what was right, some of whom paid for [illegible] their valor with their lives, if we were to pretend that there was no choice in Georgia in 1960 but silence, segregation, and subversion of the law.
With regard to the decision in Bond v Floyd, I want to reassure the committee at the outset that I bear no personal malice toward Judge Bell because he happened to rule against me. He was never impolite or hostile to me personally during those proceedings, and I am sure he believed at the time in good faith that he had decided the case directly.
Your appraisal of the Bond decision must begin with the fact that Judge Bell has told the committee he now thinks his decision was incorrect. Judge Bell's new position, of course, comes [illegible] a decade after the Supreme Court unanimously reversed him. In disavowing that decision he gave no indication of personal concern with the free speech issues at stake; he professes no conversion to worship of the First Amendment. Nonetheless, if the acknowledged error of the Bond case were merely technical, if he had misread the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure or misconstrued some tax law, his renunciation of the decision would end the matter.
But Bond v Floyd was not such a case.
You have been repeatedly asked for the last several days to recall the ""tenor of the times"" in Georgia in 1960 with regard to the issues of segregation and race. I would ask you to recall with me the tenor of the times in the United States as a whole with regard to the equally vital issues of war and peace.
America's elected leaders, despite election pledges to the contrary, were leading the country into a disastrous, costly, and immoral war in Southeast Asia. The hearing rooms of the Senate have been filled this week with officials from the Johnson administration openly denouncing both the war in Vietnam and their role in it.
But in 1966 criticism of the war was not a popular tactic for gaining Congressional support for confirmation as a member of the cabinet. In 1966 criticism of the war, still cautious, reluctant, soft spoken critisim, was anathema to the men who ran this country and a danger to those foolish enough to utter it.
Men and women were fired from their jobs, particularly teachers, for such criticism. Draft boards seized upon it as a reason or excuse to force young men into the army. In the halls of this Congress members of both bodies vitlified critics of the war with all the rhetoric and passion of which you gentlemen are capable. The then small numbers of political leaders, some of you among them, who dared to raise questions about the war were threatened with political reprisals by the White House or others. Police and FBI agents photographed and harassed opponents of the war, and burgled their offices. Men and women shrank from lending their names to petitions and organizations, recalling the work of the McCarthy committee.
[Sentence cut off.] Amendment. The Constitution, courts and judges of the United States were sorely tested. My case was just one among many. It was not the most important case. It was certainly not among the cases in which the opponents of the war suffered the greatest personal harm. It was a case which, necessarily deserved the publicity which it provoked.
But it was a case which put in issue the most basic principles on which this nation was founded some 200 years ago. It was not merely an attack on free speech, it was a full blown assault on the principle of democratic government. For what the Georgia legislative sought to do, with an openess that deceived no one, was to exclude a duly elected member of the Assembly solely because they disagreed with his views on a matter of public policy. I need not explain to you what would happen to our system of government if the legislatures and the Congress were free to exclude assemblymen, Congressmen and Senators, solely because of their views. It is down that path that Eastern Europe traveled, at the point of a bayonet, two decades ago.
Bond v Floyd was an important case. But to a United States Circuit Judge sworn to uphold the United States, it should have been an easy case. Every member of the Supreme Court knew the only possible outcome. And, in those troubled days when critics of the war turned to the Federal Courts to protect their right to express their views, most judges passed the test posed by that litigation. Judge Bell failed.
Judge Bell does not claim to be a fborn again disciple of the First Amendment. He has shown you no attitude abundantly different thean he held in 1966, he has exhibited no contrition, he has done little more than acknowledge that the Supreme Court has now concluded his decision was wrong.
I do not think that what occurred in Georgia in 1966 is likley to happen again, in similar form, in the next four years. I certainly hope not. But it is vital that the Attorney General be a person of great sensitivity to the civil liberties guaranteed by the Constitution. The Attorney General must be an administrator who will oversee the F.B.I. with a constant concern for the First and Fourteenth Amendments. The Attorney General must be a lawyer who regards enforcement of the Fourteenth and Fifteenth Amendments as of the highest priority. Griffin Bell was not such a man in 1966 and he is not such a man today.
The task ahead of this Committee is a difficult one. It will test your ability to find the truth, and it will try your consciences. I do not urge you to needlessly impugn the character of any witness, or of any others who were discussed during the hearings. I do not request that you reopen old wounds or controversies if they will shed no light on Mr. Bell's fitness.
I ask only that you give us, as the guardians of the integrity of the nation, an Attorney General whose candor before this Committee is beyond dispute, that you give us as part of the national leadership for the years ahead an Attorney General who was not wrong about the great moral issues of the last two decades, that you give us, as the chief enforcer of the civil rights laws of the United States, an Attorney General whom 20 million black Americans will know, beyond any reasonable doubt, is personally and deeply committed to the principles of equality and racial justice."

If the occasion of the bicentennial celebration serves no other purpose, it ought to remind us that the past two hundred years have been years of undeniable progress for Black Americans, of progress from chattle slavery into serfdom, from economic servitude to the faint beginnings of some political and economic independence of our own. 
At the same time we have tended to behanve like a people on a see saw; we've gone up in one direction while going down in another. 
The last twenty years - the lifetime of many of you graduating here today - have been especially climactic in the two centuries of Black struggle. In those two decades - at great human cost - we have won the right to sit in the front of the bus, to sit downstairs at the movie theatre, to vote, and tha to work and go to school in many places that formerly used to lack lacked Black faces. We have seen the numbers of us in public office increase over 200%, and have seen the last vestiges of legal apartheid begin to dissapear from the American scene. 
But at the same time we've come from the back of the bus to the front of the unemployment line, from schools run by us to the yellow school bus, from the cotton fieidl field to the welfare offices, from not being able to vote to not caring who - or if - we vote at all. 
We've come from schools run by and for us
On the way to this middle position between where we used to be and where we are now something seems to have happened to us all. Quite simply it is this: we have been unable to institutionalize the ferver and emotion that bought us this far and lacking that spir

On the way to school, too many of us forgeot young girls with spittle hanging from their dresses, who walked that lonely block past screaming harpies to put the end to the separate but unequal education forced upon our fathers. 
As when
As we forgot to vote at all on election day, or else cast a vote for candidate B because Reverend A told us to, we forgot that too many died to give us choices and not chances at the polls. 
We forgot that social commitment is not measured by the length of your hair or the trickiness of your handshake; political thought is neither rhetorical or sartorial. 
We forgot Frederick Douglass' injunction that ""there is no progress without struggle"" and have arrived at the 200th anniversary of our society's organization without purpose or commitment to anything but ourselves our individual selves. 
In too many ways, we are like too many of the rest of the population, too eagre to embrace the new and sacrifice the old. 
But we cannot find our solutions in to our problems by blaming the victims for their condition; as victim we must strike out strongly against our self-strangulation without becoming a race lead by Black Billy Grahams, but we must set our minds firmly on the source of the forces that have ground us down and nearly counted us out. 
In American in the twentieth century, we are surrounded by great turmoil all across the globe. Old assumptions about old arrangements are being challenged and found wanting, and change is being forced - often at the point of a gun - on those reluctant to share the power they gained for themselves in illegitimate ways. 
Here at home we are the bystanders to as a massive mood of indifference rushes across the land. 
It is no accident in 1976 that the two newset faces on the political scene can have successfully managed to absorb the rhetoric of the oldest, the proposition that less is more, that society cannot and should not be organized to successfully protect guarantee our lives, our liberty, and our pursuit of happiness. 
200 years ago this country found itself locaked in battle over those principles, and if history is a guide, we thought the battle had been won. Now two hundred years later the battle is being founght again, and this time even the illusion of victory may escape us.
An old blues singer once said that some men kill with bullets; others kill with the stroke of a pen.
The battles at Concord and Lexington were fought with bullets and powder; the current battle used no guns, but leaves just as many wasted lives in its wake.
The first shots in this second batlle were fired in 1968, when the forces of reaction and repression were elected to high office, and re-elected again four years later. Assisted by an impotent congress, they have engineered a series of slowdowns, cut backs, reverses in revenue, shifts in sharing and a gradual retr but real retreat of official from concern for the powerless.
The result is plain to see - the national nullification of the needs of the needy, the gratituitous gratification of the groos and the greedy, and a victory for the politics of penuriousness, prevarication, pious platitudes and self righteous swinishness, a massive manipulation of the American mind that has made the mundane magnificent.
Suddenly, 200 years after the land of the brave declared itself the home of the free, the one group of Americans who arrived on these shores the year before the Mayflower did now hear themselves called an ""alien group.""
At a time when some Americans apparently believe that a proper bicentennial celebration consists of beating a Black man in Boston with an American flag, your minds and thoughts are needed like never before.
Let me remind you of some words from the past, from a Commencement address delivered to Black college graduates 30 years ago by the late scholar, Dr. W. E. B. DuBois. He said then: 
""We are American Negroes. It is beside the point to argue whether we form a real race. Biologically, we are mingled of all conceivable elements, but race is psychology, not biology, and pshychologically, we are a unified race with one history, one red memory, one revolt. It is not ours to argue whether we will be segregated or whether we ought to be a caste. We are segregated. We are a caste. Our problem is this: how far and in what way can we consciously and scientifically guide our future so as to insure our spiritual free survival physical survival, our spiritual freedom and our social growth. Either we do this or we die. There is no alternative. If American proposed the murder of our group, its moral descent into imbecility and crime and its utter loss of manhood, self-assertion and courage, the sooner we realize this the better. By that great line of McCay, 'If we must die, let it not be like hogs.' But the alternative of not dying like hogs is not that of dying and killing like snarling dogs. It is rather conquering the world by thought and brain and plan; by expression and organized cultural ideals. Therefore, let us not beat futi;e wings in impotent frenzy, but carefully plan and guide our s segregated lives life, organize in industry and politcs to protect it and expand it. What will be, no one knows. It may be a great physical segregation of the world along the color line; it may be an economic rebirth which insures spiritual and group integrity and physical integrity diversity. It may be utter annihilation of class and race a and color barriers in one ultimate mankind, differentiated by talent, susceptibility and gift - but any of these ends are matters of long centuries, and not years. We live in years, swift, flying, transient years. We hold the possible future in our hands, but not by wish or will, only by thought, plan and organization.""*

Copywright, 1976
Julian Bond

We stand now on the eve of our two hundredth birthday as an organized people, afraid of what the future may bring, afraid ton look too critically at our past, afraid to assign guilt and responsibility for our common condition. 
On July 4th, 1776, the people of the thirteen colonies declared that the economic slavery imposed upon them by British colonialism denied their right to life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness. 
The first American revolution had begun. 
From its beginnings, it automatically excluded great sections of the population. from the democratic vision of what the United States of America could be. 
The Native Americans, whose land was stolen, whose people were slaughtered, and whose rights were trampled; the African people, kidnapped from their homelands and bought to this country as slaves, their families divided destroyed, their labor exploited, their humanity denied, their religion suppressed. 
Now two hundred years have gone by; years of struggle punctuated by civil war and nonvilent nonviolent movement. 
The original 13 colonies have turned into a great colossus, a power which threatens its own citizens with intolerable economic hardships, social disintegration and a denial of political rights. 
While the nation prepares to parade and celebrate its anniversary, an American underclass waits for its own declaration of independence to be declared. 
2
Our struggled heightened over the last twenty years, years of legal struggle in the courts which were followed by other struggles in the streets.  
3
[Typeset changes.]
system nears chaos.
Gains were won at lunch counters and movie theatres and polling places and bus stations and the fabric of legal apartheid in America was began to be destroyed. What had been a movement for civil rights has become a political movement, and Black men and women are winning office and power only dreamed of before.
But despite an increase of 150% in the number of Blacks holding office, despite the ability to sit or eat or ride or vote in places that formerly lacked Black faces, in a real way we find our condition unchanged.
A quick look at every statistic that measures how well or poorly a group of people is doing--infant mortality rates, median family income, life expectancy--shows that while our general condition has improved, our relative condition has actually worsened.
4
It is almost as though we were climbing a molasses mountain dressed in showshoes, while everyone else rides a rather leisurely ski-lift to the top. Now the ski slopes are more treacherous and the molasses melting into mud, a Sargasso Sea of crime in high places. Of joblessness for many and hopelessness for many more.
Yesterday’s gains become suspect. The bus front seat loses meaning for a people whose longest trip is likely to be from the feudal system of the rural South to the more mechanized, high-rise poverty of the North.
The right to vote loses meaning for a people forced to choose between Tweedledum and Tweedledee.
The right to an integrated education can mean little to children bussesd from one ignorant academy to another.
5
The struggles of the sixties were carried forward against discrimination in housing, employment, education and government, both because the victims became their own best champions and because they found a sympathetic ear in the national body politic.
But as the demands became more strident, as a foreign war drained treasury and manhood, as the our best and brightest were beaten down by bullets, a shift occurred in the national consciousness.
Despite a decade of protest and movement, despite election, agitation and resignation, what has occurred over the last half-decade is simple--the reins of government have been seized by a massive coalition of the comfortable, the callous and the smug, who’ve closed their hearts and their minds to the claims and calls to conscience put forward by the forgotten
6
and unrepresented elements in American society. This has resulted in the national nullification of the needs of the needy, the gratituitous gratification of the gross and the greedy, a triumph for the politics of penuriousness, prevarication and impropiety, of pious platitudes and self-righteous swinishness.
The two most recent national presidential elections gave this group awesome power, the second more a rout than an election, a rout that reinstalled the fiscal facists, the merciless merchants of the cost accounting school of social welfarism in the White House, and insured a four-year reign for men with an arrogant contempt for people and their problems.
The late American balladeer Woody Guthrie once said that some men kill with bullets; others kill with the stroke of a pen.
7
The near genocidal results of the last half decade, fostered by an impotent Congress, unable to resist presidential vetoes, impoundments, cut-backs, shifts in sharing and reverses in revenue have cut sharpest at the people on the bottom, those who traditionally look to their government for some help.
For a time, a portion of that trend appeared to be reversing itself. The normally moribund Congress. wet by Watergate and splashes from the tidal basin, made bold embarassed by the sight of one of their own ogling bare breasts in Boston, moved with some swiftness to topple a series of octogenarians made strong by the senility system and advanced the democratic process slightly by opening their own processes to fuller participation.
But in spite of rising prices and unemployment, in spite of increased inflation and dangers of recession, these same men and women lack the testicular fortitude to offer any
8
alternative to President Ford’s program of promoting austerity by making the poor pay more for food stamps and gas and by refusing a decent raise in Social Security.
But if the years before, the Kennedy and Johnson years, taught us any kind of lesson at all, it ought to have been that government, under militant and concerted pressure, would move, slowly and rather ponderously, all too often with all deliberate lack of speed, to become a limited partner of sorts with the American underclass in their struggle to do better for themselves.
The last few years have changed all that. The government’s policy toward the poor has changed from benign concern to malignant neglect.
In the decade of the sixties, the number of people living in poverty in America was reduced by nearly one third.
9
It’s not at all unreasonable to ascribe some of these gains to the so-called Great Society and New Frontier programs of that era. Yet despite these victories, the cruel and callous castrators moved with cold calculation to kill, freeze and wind down urban renewal, model cities, community action, public service employment, student loans, public housing, federal impact funds for education, and to impose a sixty percent national pullback in social services.
If we are to believe with Thomas Jefferson that the common man is ""the most precious portion of the state,"" we find that precious resource in real danger of economic extinction today.
Human problems are now placed on a balance sheet, forced to add up, to pay for themselves.
10
The new administrators in Washington run the programs they direct with all the solicitude of a hungry mortician at an old folks home.
While the nation waltzed into the seventies believing that its ""Black problem"" had either been burned or blown away, infant mortality rates for us remained twice as high as for everyone else, nearly half of all Black families in the United States earned less than $5,000 a year, the average Black American male was still dying seven years earlier than his white counterpart, we remained the last to be hired and the first to be fired.
Watergate became more than an apartment building to live in. Richard Nixon turned it into a shameful nightmare we were forced to live in. More than just a residential-commercial complex crowded against the banks of the Potomac,
11
Watergate came to symbolize for millions of Americans the lengths to which moronic moral midgets will go to cool their Potomac fever.
Internationally our money is becoming counterfeit in world money markets. Our foreign policy bears the stamp of give-away Kissinger’s kiss of death. Domestic policy suffers for the lack of any attention at all. Schools no longer educate our young. And our young, knowing nothing, are nodding in the doorways of abandoned cities while hoping things will go better with ""coke"". For Black America, the tentative economic gains of the sixties are slowly but surely slipping from our grasp. For Black America, it is still true, despite the war on poverty which we apparently lost, that one-third of all our children still live in poverty…. A fact that bodes ill for future Black generations. It is still true that a Black college
12
graduate in 1976 stands a great chance of earning less money over a lifetime of employment than will a white high school dropout.
We are where we are today because of a confluence of events of the nineteen sixties. The nonviolent--and in retrospect, lovable--marchers of the first part of that decade began to be replaced, if not in fact then certainly in the public fancy, by the rapacious rioters of the latter part of the sixties. America’s major cities were believed to be either in flames, under martial law, or sinking under the dead weight of a population of pensioners, the unemployed young, or their presumably unemployable parents.
The middle mind of America was running away from social concerns in a crisis state all their own. They rightly perceived that their taxes--higher proportionately than those paid by the their pernicious President of the past--were escalating
13
to pay for barely maintaining what they were running away from, but they were wrongly taught, by their President and others, that their taxes were high because of the lazey poor and not because of the corporate evader and military glutton. Lower level administrators--the mayors, councilmen and commissioners--began to face an all too often list of plagues that we have come to call the urban crisis--drug addiction, increased racial friction, civil service militancy, housing destroyed by Plan ‘A’ faster than it’s built by Plan ‘B’, schools which warehouse and miseducate their students, relief rolls which give relief to no one.
For them, the New Federalism promised to be manna from heaven.
It promised new money for all, money to pave the streets, to pay the police, to clean the air and water. But
14
instead of manna and millions, it became pennies stolen from the poor, robbing Peter to pay Paul half of what Paul couldn’t get by on to begin with.
The result was to shift burden and responsibility--and accountability--from the federal government where the resources were, to the states and towns and cities where the resources aren’t.
The rhetoric from Washington about sharing the wealth became a scandalous exercise in consolidating wealth and power where they always were, away from the cities, away from the children, away from people for whom wealth is an extra meal and for whom power is the ability to hide from the census taker.
The often repeated connection between today’s dilemma and the end of the Reconstruction era 100 years ago
15
is more than frightening.
Then and now, a president desperate for power entered into an illicit arrangement, not just with the unreconstructed South, but with the national unreconstructed mentality that believed then--as it believes now--that private profit and public arrogance could be pursued at the expense of the people living on the American margin.
Concurrently, many of the formerly liberal crusaders for social justice and democracy became tired, or involved in other, less traumatic concerns.
For many of them, picking up beer cans by the side of the public highway became an acceptable substitute to winning jobs in the brewery for Black people.
The aspirations of and movement by Black people began to be curtailed, not by organized violence and barbarity,
16
but by a series of nationally choreographed legal and extra legal manuevers designed to make us less than politicanl and economic equals.
The frenetic--and often frantic--activity of the nineteen sixties had created a political climate characterized by selfishness and fear; a political constituency was recruited from the frightened to form solid ranks against the forgotten.
Backlash is too hackneyed a term for a people confused by long hair and frightened by clenched fists, their politics misdirected by those who verbally oppose crime in the streets but secretly practice crime in the suites. This manipulation of the American mind has made the mundane magnificent, and placed government in the hands of men who believe in privilege for the powerful and neglect of the powerless.
There can be no better prescription for relieving this crisis, and for reviving some interest in it, than by
17
creating a non-partisan national coalition of need, with us as base, of mothers parents who want care, not warehousing for [the] their children, of workers who want work at a decent and protected wage, of people who work for their living and can’t live on what they make as well as those who can’t find work but can’t live on what we so grudgingly give, of all those people who want an end to welfare and capitalism for the poor and subsidy and socialism for the wealthy and all who must learn that stability sufficiency for those at the bottom is compatible with sufficiency stability for those in the middle…. All those people now live in America, divided now by race and class, fearful of each other, contentious and impotent. Now the analysts have told us that fewer and fewer of our people see their salvation in the political process. The 1974 election turnout was less than 40% of those eligible, and for the first time, high and low
18
education and income became a factor among those who chose not to choose.
""It is because all the candidates seem alike,"" someone said, ""alike in appearance, in program, and in promise.""
It’s true, because the issues then were age and incumbency, and allegiance to fallen idols, or contests between the demonstrated failures of one set of hopefuls and the unproved promised of another; nowhere was there commitment to radical social and economic change of the sort needed to lift the underclass to simple survival level.
An entire political movement came to near maturity in America in the sixties. Fueled by the fire from the Southern civil rights movement, it threatened to challenge the foundations of monopoly capital, of white skin privilege,
19
of the racial arrogance that has drained our treasury and young manhood and created vast reservations of the unwanted on this country’s soil.
That movement became the partial victim of its own success. It fought for and won the right to sit in front of the bus, to cast a vote, to sit at a lunch counter. It launched a Southern Black political movement, but it failed to sustain and extend itself, and instead saw itself dissipated by struggles on the edge.
For some of us, being Black became a rhetorical or sartorial accomplishment.
For many, social commitment began to be measured by the length of your hair, or the intricacy of your handshake.
Many of the young people who some years ago marched with us militantly in the streets are now found running nude on the college grounds, attempting to prove perhaps, that all men
20
are not created equal.
The political process needs to be put to a constant test, not as an election day effort alone, but as another weapon in an arsenal that lately has contained more pop guns than howitzers.
It comes to climax next this year with the selection process for choosing a new President of the United States.
Prior to that selection there must be developed a rational basis for choosing among the varied dozens that offer themselves to us as candidates.
That in turn means the construction among us of a national movement to insist of certain basic themes that must be accepted by a candidate acceptable to us. They would include:
21
[Page handwritten.]
In foreign affairs, an end to subversion and assassination as national policy; a one-third cut in the defense budget; an end to open checkbooks for totalitarian regimes; a new Marshall plan to eradicate hunger in the third world; a cessasation of tolerance for Africa’s settler states; a non-intervention pledge in other nation’s affairs.  ; a guarantee of national integrity for Israel and a homeland for the Palestinians,
In domestic affairs, ------
22

income and wealth redistribution through a tax structure that reduces the disparity between the needy and the greedy;
the elimination of poverty through a program of full employment supplemented by a negative income tax for workers earning on the margin;
an educational system that dignifies vocational as well as academic training, and permits each American to realize full potential;
free, adequate health care for all Americans, financed though the national treasury and not profit-making insurance companies;
effective social control of monopoly, and
national, regional or municipal ownership of vital services operated for need, and not for profit.

23
These promise no perfect world, but do hold out the hope that man we can create a system of laws and relationships between men us that promise more than our present system of privilege for only a few.
We ought to be reminded of some words from Dr. W. E. B. DuBois nearly half a century ago:
""We are American Negroes. It is beside the point to ask whether we form a real race. Biologically we are mingled of all conceivable elements, but race is psychology, not biology, and psychologically we are a unified race with one history, one red memory, one revolt. It is not ours to argue whether we will be segregated or whether we ought to be a caste. We are segregated; we are a caste. Our problem is: how far and in what way can we consciously and scientifically guide our future so as to insure our physical
24
survival, our spiritual freedom and our social growth? Either we do this or we die. There is no alternative. If America proposed the murder of our group, its moral descent into imbecility and crime and its utter loss of manhood, self-assertion and courage, the sooner we realize this the better. By that great line of McKay, ""If we must die, let it not be like hogs."" But the alternative of not dying like hogs is not that of dying or killing like snarling dogs. It is rather conquering the world by thought and brain and plan; by expression and organized cultural ideals. Therefore, let us not beat futile wings in impotent frenzy; but carefully plan and guide our segregated life, organize in industry and politics to protect it and expand it. What will be, no one knows. It may be a great physical segregation of the world along with the color line; it may be an economic rebirth which
25
insures spiritual and group integrity amid physical diversity. It may be utter annihilation of class and race and color barriers in one ultimate mankind, differentiated by talent, suceptibility and gift--but any of these ends are matters of long centuries and not years. We live in years, swift, flying, transient years. We hold the possible future in our hands, but not by wish and will, only by thought, plan and organization.""*

You have all heard the story of the elderly Black man who labored for many years in an ice house owned by a white man. Finally, at the encouragement of his friends, he opened an ice house of his own. After about six months of no business, he closed down, and his dreams, like his ice, melted away. He ran across the friend who had been his strongest supporter and asked him why none of his friends had bought his ice. ""Don't you know?"" the friend replied. ""The white man's ice is colder.""
Colder ice, stronger medicine, sweeter sugar. These are the results of 200 years of psychological slavery that has convinced us that we can't do what we were kept from doing through no fault of our own. It is the classic case of the victim blaming himself for the crime, of the man with no boots cursing his lack of bootstraps. Ice is, after all, just ice; medicine only medicine, and brown sugar sweeter than any other.
We are in the middle now of the observation of our 200th anniversary
2
as an organized people on this continent, many of us are afraid of what the future may bring, afraid to look too critically at our past, afraid to assign guilt and responsibility for our common condition.
In these 200 years we have come quite a long way. We can now sit in the front of the bus, sit downstairs at the movie theatre, register, vote and hold office where once we could not, and generally see many more Black faces in high places. At the same time, we've moved from the cotton field to the high-rise ghetto, from the back of the bus to the front of the welfare line, from segregated schools run by us to the open road and the yellow school bus.
Some statistics suggest that for our young, the end of education may mean the beginning of unemployment, the creation of a permanent class of unemployed and unemployable persons who are condemned to a lifetime of public charity.
Look at only one indication of the social costs which we all pay. The Bureau of the Census reported that 75% of all inmates in state prisons were between 18 and 34 years old, compared with 40% of the general population; that 61% of them were high school dropouts,
3
compared to 26% of the general population; that 52% of them had been sentenced twice for the same offense, that 61% had used drugs on a daily basis at some time in their lives, that 27% had served in the armed forces, as opposed to 43% of the general male population, and of those who had served, 42% had received either general or dishonorable discharges.
Most importantly, 47% of them were Black.
These are our young male adults, the promise of our future. These are the products of benign concern and malignant neglect, of 200 years of official carelessness with the life chances of one-tenth of the nation's population. These are the vast army of the unwanted, the products of assembly-line education, of a social welfare system designed to destroy families, of a government that publically opposes crime in the streets and privately practices crime in the suites.
They are reflective of the chances we all have. At a time when some Americans apparently believe that a proper bicentennial celebration consists of beating a Black man in Boston with an American flag, it is obvious that our position on the margin is never more secure than we make it.
4
Of immediate importance is solidifying the gains won over the past two decades before inflation and recession wash them away.
The old story of last hired - first fired and the attempts by the Nixon - Ford administration to roll back the second Reconstruction mean that we must give immediate priority to simply staying where we are, to escaping from the see-saw principle that has been ours over the last decade -- going up in one direction and down in another. A great deal of our salvation lies in our grasp, independent of the political fortunes of men and parties.
It is found in our willingness to revive the spirit of the sixties, not with marches and protestations, but with the notion that struggle and sacrifice are constants, ever with us, not to be abandoned because rhetoric changes or fashions shift.
On the way to this middle position between where we used to be and where we are now, something seems to have happened to us all. On the way to school, too many of us forgot young girls with spittle hanging from their dresses, who walked that lonely block past screaming harpies to put an end to the separate but unequal education forced upon our fathers and mothers. As we forgot to
5
vote at all on election day, or else cast a vote for candidate 'B' because Reverend 'A' told us to, we forgot that too many died to give us choices and not chances at the polls. We forgot that social commitment is not measured by the length of your hair or the trickiness of your handshake; political thought is neither rhetorical nor sartorial. We forgot Frederick Douglass' injunction that ""there is no progress without struggle"" and have arrived at the 200th anniversary of our society's organization without purpose or commitment to anything but our individual selves.
In too many ways, we are like too much of the rest of the population, too eager to embrace the new and sacrifice the old.
In America in the twentieth century, we are surrounded by great turmoil all across the globe. Old assumptions about old arrangements are being challenged and found wanting, and change is being forced, often at the point of a gun, on those reluctant to share the power they gained for themselves in illegitimate ways. Here at home we are the guilty bystanders, as a massive mood of indifference rushes across the land.
It is no accident in 1976 that the two newest faces on the political scene have successfully managed to absorb the rhetoric of the oldest,
6
The proposition that less is more, that society cannot and should not be organized to successfully guarantee our lives, our liberty, and our pursuit of happiness.
Two hundred years ago, this country found itself locked in bloody battle over these principles, and if history is a guide, we thought the battle had been won. Now the battle is being fought again, and this time even the illusion of victory may escape us.
An old blues singer once said that some men kill with bullets, others kill with the stroke of a pen. The battles at Concord and Lexington were fought with bullets and powder. The current battle uses no guns, but leaves just as many wasted lives in its wake. The first shots in this second battle were fired in 1968, when the forces of reaction and repression were elected to high office, and re-elected four years later. Assisted by an impotent Congress, they have engineered a series of slowdowns, cut-backs, reverses in revenue, shifts in sharing, and a gradual but very real retreat from concern for the powerless.
The result is plain to see: the national nullification of the needs of the needy, the gratuitous gratification of the gross
7
and the greedy, and a victory for the politics of penuriousness, prevarication, pious platitudes and self-righteous swinishness, a massive manipulation of the American mind that has made the mundane magnificent.
Suddenly, two hundred years after the land of the brave declared itself the home of the free, the one group of Americans who arrived on these shores the year before the Mayflower, now hear themselves called an ""alien group.""
Sadly, although others persist in treating us as alien, we increasingly and rightly insist that we be treated just like others, but act as though we belonged to no group but ourselves.
A survey done of the Blacks who serve in the Georgia General Assembly is revealing. 75% reported that all or most of their campaign monies came from outside the constituencies they represented. 50% reported receiving no money at all from Black professionals, the one group in our community able -- but apparently unwilling -- to contribute to Black candidates for public office.
Of all Black professionals, only school teachers had a good record of political fund giving.
8
Not doctors or lawyers or butchers or bakers demonstrated any great financial concern for influencing the election of Black candidates to this important office, which regulates each of these professions in some manner. Black candlestick makers have yet to be heard from, but I would doubt if their performance is any better than that of their fellows.
The result is clear: if you want to give a dance, you've got to pay the band, and not only are we lax in voting, we are lax in giving, too.
There's an old saying in politics. It is: ""Whose bread I eat, his song I sing."" And if the Georgia experience is typical -- and I believe it is -- then white bread is the unfortunate diet of choice for Black candidates for public office.
Increasingly, Black professionals are becoming more sophisticated in lobbying with City Councils and state legislatures for the things which enhance their ability to function well in a society dominated by hostile interests. The average Black elected official is a layman, and he has no specialized knowledge other than his or her convictions about what ought to be.
But until the Black professional becomes an active political
9
participant -- not just as a voter or as an informational source, but also as part of the campaign fund drive -- we can expect no radical change in the way things have always been.
My constituents have an average annual income of about $4,000 per family. They have been generous with their votes and their dollars, but I sit on legislative committees that regulate Medicaid payments to physicians and druggists, on another which is currently investigating consumer complaints about a variety of businesses, and on one set up to aid small and minority-owned businesses in my state.
My vote -- out of 56 in my state Senate -- sets salary levels for all school personnel from teachers to janitors, helps decide how long lawyers must live in Georgia before they can practice law, whether or not they've got to take the bar exam, whether optometrists can share in insurance coverage with opthamalogists, and generally who gets how much of what from whom.
This is a large responsibility, and like others throughout the country who serve in legislatures, on City Councils and County Commissions, I try to discharge it as best I can.
Now that the hand that used to pick cotton is helping pick Mayors
10
and Sheriffs, I'd appreciate that hand digging up some cash now and then.
One of the great success stories of the last decade and a half -- in spite of the recession, inflation, and unemployment rates as high as 50% among some sections of the Black population -- has been the growth of the Black middle class.
If this section of our population only apes and imitates its white counterparts, then it ignores the fact that it exists on the backs of others less fortunate, that it rose to relative affluence because others fought hard battles before, or that a remaining 33% of us cannot generate enough income to provide the basic necessities of life.
We hear a great deal today about qualifications, and we each know of the Jackie Robinson syndrome that requires each of us to be more qualified than the Chairman of the Board to get a job being the first to do more for less pay.
Despite all our degrees and experience, the single, great qualifier for many Black professionals was not their skill or intelligence, but 200 years of struggle fought for people who couldn't conjugate a verb but could carry a picket sign; people who worked from can't
11
to can so their children wouldn't have to; people who died so the rest of us might live.
That 'qualified' me to be a State Senator in Georgia, and it 'qualified' a lot more of us than we may care to recall.
To ignore that history, or ignore the necessity for carrying that battle onward is to condemn ourselves to more of the same, of second class lives lived in cast off homes, of separate and unequal education for our children, and the perpetual existence of a large American underclass, too many of whom are us.
What is additionally frightening to discover -- in the middle of 1976 -- is that once again the nation is preparing to choose a President, and we are less prepared than at any time in the last ten years to participate in that choice.
The facts are real ones. While Black people in the Southern region have a generally good record of local political performance, nationally we are in real danger of counting ourselves out of helping choose who will govern us over the next four years.
In 1960, in a close election between John. F. Kennedy and Richard Nixon, 39 million eligible Americans, Black and white, failed to vote.
In 1964, when Lyndon Johnson defeated Barry Goldwater in a
12
landslide election, 43 million Americans chose not to choose.
In 1968, the figure rose to 47 million, and in 1972, 63 million Americans stayed at home and let the rest of us choose between Richard Nixon and George McGovern.
More frightening for us in 1972 was this: fewer than one-half of the 14 million Blacks who could have said ""no"" to Nixon were even registered to vote.
Based on U.S. Census figures, I can tell if you are a regular voter or not. If you are between 45 and 64 years old, a college graduate, have lived in the same place for more than ten years, and have an annual income over $10,000, then you vote with some regularity. If you are between 18 and 24, have a high school or elementary school education, live on a farm in the South and make less than $5,000 a year, then you don't vote, and you don't count, and no one counts you.
It was a point of pride for many of us to recall that not a single Black face -- except for the security guard who discovered the break-in -- was involved at all in what we now call the Watergate affair. For some of us, this was either an indication of extra-high morality among us, or a sign that the Nixon
13
administration was so racist, they didn't even want to grant us equality in crime. Sadly, however, I know too many soul brothers who would have gladly cut John Dean's throat if they could have replaced him at Richard Nixon's right hand. The point here is that Black Americans had it in their power earlier to have erased this sorry episode from our country's history, to have prevented the entire scandal.
In 1968, if we have voted an additional ten more Black voters per Black precinct across the United States:

Richard Nixon would not have been elected President;
Berger, Blackmon, Powell and Rehnquist would not now be on the United States Supreme Court;
Spiro Agnew would either still be the Governor of Maryland or would be doing long time;
John Mitchell never would have been Attorney General;
John Dean and Charles Colson would be practicing law in obscurity;
and Gerald Ford would not now be the President of the United States.

Without attempting to shoulder all the blame for the last eight years of reactionary rule, we must share some of the responsibility,
14
for in spite of restrictive law and social custom, in spite of shifts to the right by all other sections of the old liberal coalition we once belonged to, it is an undeniable fact: Black non-voters opened wide the door for the Nixon years in 1968, just as surely as if we had carried him into office on our backs, and on our backs he was.
Now despite a generally good record of recent participation by Southern Blacks, the Voter Education Project estimates a 15% gap between Black and white registration in the 11 Southern states.
Nationally, the picture is even worse. In proportionate numbers, there are today more Black people registered to vote in Selma, Alabama, than there are in Chicago, Detroit, New York or Philadelphia. In fact, between the elections held in 1968 and 1972, the numbers of Black people registered in the North and West declined, and the number of Blacks who voted in 1972 was less than the number who voted in 1968 and 1964.
In 1972, we were 9.9% of the total electorate, 8.9% of all registered voters, and 8.1% of all those who actually voted.
There is an old cliche which says: ""All that is necessary for evil to triumph is for good men to do nothing.""
15
It's not enough to be Black by birth; that was an accident. To be Black in life is the supreme test, to demonstrate every day, in word and deed, that you are a part of a great people, of a national movement that has had its ups and downs and will have more, but which demands your allegiance unless through some magic you managed to escape the burden of being the eight-ball in a universe built for ivory.
There's an old piece of campaign literature which is a particular favorite of mine. It is a piece of white paper with a large Black spot on it. The slogan at the bottom says: ""Blow on this spot. If it turns white, you have won a million dollars. If not, protect your own interests and vote for John Smith.""
Can we not now stop blowing on spots and begin to protect ourselves? If we don't do it, no one will.

Futurists even have their own language: They discuss the post-industrial, post-scarcity, superindustrial, globally homeopathic, post-affluent, pre-figurative society that may, they say, be soon upon us. Their models are developed through trend extrapolation, cross impact analysis, mutual causal paradigms, and transformational matrixes, predicted on resometrics, technetronics, synergetics or anticipatory democracy within either macro - or micro-systems.
We can surely expect much more change by the year 2000 A.D. Twenty-five years from now our world's population may be six billion people. We may have by then developed the ability to create ourselves through genetic engineering, to create a race of men and women less hostile
2
to each other, less selfish of their own resources. We may be able to alter our weather, as well as our consciousness.
Within only three years, fifty per cent of the world's population will be reached by television, and fifty per cent of the world's goods and services will be produced by the multi-national corporation. We are changing from an industrial economy into a service economy, an economy in which service availability and informational ability will become the currency of the future. We are sure to go through a series of violent and nonviolent wars of redistribution like the current crises over who can charge how much for oil.
No one of course can plot or plan the future unless we are able to know the past and describe our present situation.
We have just passed our two hundredth birthday as a people. We are afraid of what the future will bring, afraid to look too critically at our past, afraid to assign guilt, and afraid to assume
3
responsibility for our common condition.
We have a fairly new President, elected by a majority of one, who in turn has chosen a new Vice-President. We find ourselves in a time of international turmoil and domestic dilemma, of national indecision about the ways and means to stop rising prices and falling expectations. Across the rest of the world, there are changes are taking place. rapid changes occur.
In Africa, the people of Mozambique and Guinea-Bissau have reached freedom and self-determination. The North Vietnamese are consolidating their victory over American military might and will soon excercise control over their entire nation.
In Europe, in Latin America, with some notable exceptions, the struggle for justice and right against oppression and wrong continues.
Only in America is there hesitation and faltering, uncertainty and indecision. Only here do popular movements among the oppressed rise and fall as regularly as do the phases of the moon.
4
The last twenty-five years of Black struggle in America have produced some marvelous victories, often overlooked today as unemployment increases and the economic system approaches chaos.
Victories were won at lunch counters and movie theatres and polling places and bus stations; the fabric of legal apartheid in America destroyed. What had been a movement for civil rights has become a political movement; Black men and women are winning elective office and gaining power that they formerly only dreamed of.
But despite an increase of 150% in the number of Black people holding office, despite the freedom to sit or eat or ride or vote in places that formerly lacked Black faces, in a real way we find our condition unchanged.
Every statistic that measure how well or how poorly a group of people fares, including infant mortality rates, median family income, and life expectancy, shows that while our general condition has improved, our relative condition has actually worsened.
5
It is as if we were climbing a molasses mountain, wearing snow shoes, while everyone else rides a leisurely ski-lift to the summit. Now the ski slopes are more treacherous, the molasses melts into mud, into a Sargasso Sea of crime in high places, into a swamp of joblessness for many and hopelessness for more.
Yesterday's gains become suspect. The seat at the front of the bus loses meaning to a people whose longest trip is likely to be from the feudal system of the rural South to the mechanized, high-rise poverty of the North.
The right to vote loses its meaning to a people offered a choice between Tweedledum and Tweedledee.
The right to an integrated education means little to children who are bussed from one academy of ignorance to another.
The struggles of the sixties were carried forward against discrimination in housing, employment, education and government, because the victims became their own best champions and because they found a
6
sympathetic ear in the body politic.
But, as the demands became more strident, as a foreign war drained both treasury and manhood, as the best and brightest were beaten down by bullets, a shift occurred in the national consciousness.
Despite protest and movement, despite election, agitation and resignation, what has occurred during the last ten years is simple: the reins of government have been seized by a massive coalition of the comfortable, the callous and the smug. Men who have closed their hearts and their minds to the claims and calls to conscience put forward by the forgotten and unrepresented elements in American society. Their actions have resulted in the national nullification of the needs of the needy; tin the gratuitous gratification of the gross and the greedy; in a triumph for the politics of penuriousness, prevarication and impropriety; in the perpetuation of pious platitudes and self-righteous swinishness.
The two most recent national presidential elections gave this
7
awesome power to this group of men, with their arrogant contempt for people and their problems. The second, more a rout than an election, reinstalled the fiscal fascists, the merciless merchants of the cost accounting school of social welfarism, in the White House.
The late American balladeer Woody Guthrie once said that some men kill with bullets, others kill with the stroke of a pen.
The near genocidal acts of the last half decade, fostered by an impotent Congress unable to resist Presidential vetoes, impoundments, cut-backs, shifts in sharing and reverses in revenue, have cruelly cut the people on the bottom rung of the economic ladder, those who traditionally look to their government for help.
At one time, the genocidal trend appeared to be reversed. A moribund Congress, wet from Watergate and splashed from the Tidal Basin, was emboldened by the sight of one of their own ogling bare breasts in Boston, and moved swiftly to topple octogenarians bolstered by the senility system, and thus advanced the democratic process
8
slightly by opening their own processes to fuller participation.
But despite rising prices and unemployment, despite increased inflation and dangers of recession, these same men and women lack the testicular fortitude to offer any alternative to President Ford's programs to promote austerity by forcing the poor to pay more for food stamps and gas, and by refusing to grant a decent raise in Social Security benefits.
If the previous years, the Kennedy and Johnson years, had taught us any lesson, it was that government, under militant and concerted pressure, would move, slowly, ponderously, and with all deliberate lack of speed, to become a limited partner with the American underclass in their struggle to help themselves.
The last few years have changed all that. The government's policy toward the poor has changed from benign concern to malignant neglect.
In the sixties, the number of people living in poverty in
9
America was reduced by one third. It is reasonable to ascribe some of these gains to the so-called Great Society and New Frontier programs. In succeeding years, the new crowd of cruel and callous castrators moved with cold calculation to kill, freeze and wind down programs for urban renewal, model cities, community action, public service employment, student loans, public housing, federal impact funds for education, and swiftly imposed a sixty per cent national pullback in social services.
If we are to believe with Thomas Jefferson that the common man is ""the most precious portion of the state,"" we find that precious resource to be in real danger of economic extinction. Human problems are now placed on a balance sheet, forced to add up, to pay for themselves. The heartless crowd in Washington administers programs designed for and paid for by the common man with all the solicitude of a hungry mortician at an old folks home.
10
The nation waltzed into the seventies believing that its ""Black problem"" had been either burned or blown away. But infant mortality rates for us remained twice as high as for everyone else; nearly one half of all Black families in the United States earned less that $5,000 per year; the average Black American was still dying seven years earlier than his white counterpart; and we remained the last to be hired and the first to be fired.
The Watergate became more than just an apartment building to live in. Richard Nixon turned it into a shameful nightmare we were forced to live with. The Watergate became more than just a residential and commercial complex crowded against the banks of the Potomac. Now it symbolizes for all Americans the lengths to which moronic moral midgets will go to cool their Potomac fever.
Our money is becoming counterfeit in world currency markets. Our foreign policy bears the stamp of give-away Kissinger's kiss of death. Domestic policy suffers for the lack of any attention at all.
11
Schools no longer educate our young. And our young, knowing nothing, are nodding in the doorways of abandoned cities while hoping things will go better with ""Coke."" For Black America, the tentative economic gains of the sixties are slowly but surely slipping from our grasp. For Black America, it is still true, despite the War on Poverty, which we apparently lost, that one-third of all our children still live in poverty, a truth that bodes ill for future Black generations. It is still true that a Black college graduate stands a good chance of earning less money during a lifetime of employment than will a white high school dropout.
We are where we are today because of a confluence of events in the 1960s. The nonviolent, and in retrospect, lovable, marchers of the early part of that decade began to be replaced, if not in fact then certainly in the public fancy, by the rapacious rioters of the late sixties. America's cities were believed to be either in flames, under martial law, or sinking under the dead weight of a population
12
of pensioners, the unemployed young, or their presumably unemployable parents.
The middle mind of America was running away from social concerns in a crisis state all their own. They rightly perceived that their taxes, higher proportionately than those paid by the pernicious President of the past, were escalating to pay for barely maintaining what they were running away from, but they were wrongly taught, by their President and others, that their taxes were high because of the lazy poor, not because of the corporate evader and the military glutton.
Lower level administrators, the Mayors, Councilmen and Commissioners, began to face an all too long list of plagues that we have come to call the urban crisis: drug addiction, increased racial friction, civil service militancy, housing destroyed by Plan ""A"" faster than it is built by Plan ""B"", schools which warehouse and miseducate their students, relief rolls which give relief to no one.
For them, the New Federalism promised to be manna from Heaven.
13
It promised new money for all, money to pave the streets, to pay the police, to clean the air and water. But instead of manna and millions, it was pennies stolen from the poor, robbing Peter to pay Paul half of what Paul couldn't get by on to begin with.
The result was to shift the burden of responsibility and accountability from the federal government where the resources are, to the states and towns and cities where the resources are not.
The rhetoric from Washington about sharing the wealth became a scandalous exercise in consolidating wealth and power in places where they always dwelled: away from the cities, away from the children, away from people for whom wealth is an extra meal and for whom power is the ability to hide from the census taker.
The popular comparison between today's dilemma and the end of the Reconstruction era one hundred years ago is more than just a frightening story. Then as now, a President desperate for power entered into an illicit arrangement, not only with the unreconstructed

South, but with the national unreconstructed mentality that believed then, as it believes now, that private profit and public arrogance could be pursued at the expense of the people living on the American margin.
Concurrently, many of the liberal crusaders for social justice and democracy became tired, or involved in other, less traumatic concerns. For many of them, picking up beer cans by the side of the public highway became an acceptable substitute to winning jobs in the brewery for Black people.
The aspirations of and the movement of Black people began to be curtailed, not by organized violence and barbarity, but by a series of nationally choreographed legal and extra-legal manuevers designed to make us less than political and economic equals.
The frenetic, and often frantic, activity of the 1960s had created a political climate characterized by selfishness and fear; a political constituency was recruited from the frightened to form solid ranks against the forgotten.
15
Backlash is too hackneyed a term for a people confused by long hair and frightened by clenched fists, their politics misdirected by those who verbally oppose crime in the streets but who secretly practice practice crime in the suites. This manipulation of the American mind has made the mundane magnificent, and has placed government in the hands of men who believe in privilege for the powerful and neglect for the powerless.
There can be no better prescription for relieving this crisis, and for reviving some interest in it, than by creating a nonpartisan national coalition of need, with us as base, of mothers who want care, not warehousing for their children, ; of workers who want work at a decent and protected wage, ; of people who work for their living and can't live on what they make; as well as those who can't find work but who can't live on what we so grudgingly give. A coalition of of all those people who want an end to welfare and capitalism for the poor and subsidy and socialism for the wealthy; and all who must learn that stability for
16
those at the bottom is compatible with sufficiency for those in the middle. All those people now live in America, divided by race and class, fearful of each other, contentious and impotent.
Now the analysts have told us that fewer and fewer of our people see their salvation in the political process. The 1974 election turnout was less than 40% of those eligible to vote, and for the first time, high and low education and income became a factor among those who chose not to choose.
""It is because all the candidates seem alike,"" someone said, ""Alike in appearance, in program, and in promise.""
It's true, because the issues then were age and incumbency, and allegiance to fallen idols, or contests between the demonstrated failures of one set of hopefuls and the unproved promises of another; nowhere was there commitment to radical social and economic change of the sort needed to lift the underclass to simple survival level.
An entire political movement came to near maturity in America
17
in the sixties. Fueled by the fire from the Southern Civil Rights Movement, it threatened to challenge the foundations of monopoly capital, of white skin privilege, ,of the racial arrogance that has drained our treasury and young manhood and created vast reservations of the unwanted on this country's soil.
That movement became the partial victim of its own success. It fought for and won the right to sit in front of the bus, to cast a vote, to sit at a lunch counter. It launched a Southern Black political movement, but it failed to sustain and extend itself, and instead saw itself dissipated by struggles on the edge.
For some of us, being Black became a rhetorical or sartorial accomplishment. For many, social commitment began to be measured by the length of your hair, or the intricacy of your handshake. Many of the young people who some years ago marched militantly in the streets are now running nude on the college grounds, attempting to prove that
18
all men are not created equal.
The political process needs to be put to a test, not as an election day effort alone, but as another weapon in an arsenal that lately has contained more pop guns than howitzers. It reaches a climax this year with the selection process for a new President of the United States. The election which will be upon us shortly has obviously not excited as many people as its more frantic predecessor four years ago, when only half of those who could, cared to choose between Richard Nixon and George McGovern.
This year's contest, offering only a choice between the unproved promises of one fallible man and the poor past performance of another, threatens to attract even fewer partisans to the polls on November 2nd.
The reasons for this un-attraction are many and varied, and speak most alarmingly to the decline of mass participation in the political process. Through most of 1976, we witnessed a record high number of
19
candidates running against each other in a record high number of primaries in which a record low number of voters helped choose the eventual nominees. Pluralities replaced majorities and elections were won by margins that would have guaranteed oblivion in past years.
Now two candidates whose debates remind us of blindfolded boxers come before us to ask for our votes in November. What we need to be about this election year, and all the years to come, is the development of a new American majority, a constituency of the concerned who will create election majorities that can guarantee:

income and wealth redistribution through a tax structure that reduces the disparity between the needy and the greedy;
elimination of poverty through a program of full employment supplemented by a negative income tax for workers on the margin;
an educational system that dignifies vocational as well as academic training, and permits each American to realize full potential;
free, adequate health care for all Americans, financed through
20
	the national treasury, not by profit making insurance companies;
effective social control of monopoly; and
national regional or municipal ownership of vital services operated for need, and not for profit.

These promise no perfect world, but do hold out the hope that man can create a system of laws and relationships between men that promise more than our present system of privilege for a few.
We ought to be reminded of some words spoken by Dr. W.E.B. DuBois nearly half a century ago:
""We are American Negroes. It is beside the point to ask whether we form a real race. Biologically, we are mingled of all conceivable elements, but race is psychology, not biology, and psychologically we are a unified race with one history, one red memory, one revolt. It is not ours to argue whether we will be segregated or whether we ought to be a caste. We are segregated; we are a caste. Our problem is: How far and in what way can we consciously and scientifically guide
21
our future so as to insure our physical survival, our spiritual freedom and our social growth? Either we do this or we die. There is no alternative. If America proposed the murder of our group, its moral descent into imbecility and crime and its utter loss of manhood, self-assertion and courage, the sooner we realize this the better. By that great line of McKay, ""If we must die, let it not be like hogs."" But the alternative of not dying like hogs is not that of dying or killing like snarling dogs. It is rather conquering the world by thought and brain and plan; by expression and organized cultural ideals. Therefore, let us not beat futile wings in impotent frenzy; but carefully plan and guide our segregated life, organize in industry and politics to protect it and expand it. What will be, no one knows. It may be a great physical segregation of the world along the color line; it may be an economic rebirth which insures spiritual and group integrity amid physical diversity. It may be utter annihiliation by class and race and color
22
barriers in one ultimate mankind, differentiated by talent, susceptibility and gift--but any of these ends are matters of long centuries and not years. We live in years, swift, flying, transient years. We hold the possible future in our hands, but not by wish and will, only by thought, plan and organization.""*

One hundred and seven years ago, In May, 1869, the sub-surface struggle between the movement for the enfranchisement of Black men, and the movement for the enfranchisement of all women, came to the surface.
The great abolitionist, Frederick Douglass, spoke to the issue as he saw it then. He said: ""When women, because they are women, are dragged from their homes and hung upon lamposts; when their children are torn from their arms and their brains dashed upon the pavement; when they are objects of insult and outrage at every turn; when they are in danger of having their homes [torn] burnt down over their heads; when their children are not allowed to enter schools; then they will have an urgency to obtain the ballot.""
Someone in his audience cried out: ""Is that not all true about Black women?"" Douglass replied: ""Yes, yes, yes it is true of the Black woman, but not because she is a women but because she is Black.""
The [illegible] coalition that militant feminists and militant abolitionists of that day had reconstructed to win voting rights for the then all destroyed itself over the still pressing question of which part of the coalition partnership seeking freedom for people marked by color and sex would win their rights first.
From that day to this, the conflict has continued.
It is seen strongly today as the beginning to our economic system collapses around us, and demonstrates now, more than ever before, its inability to adequately distribute the goods and resources we all own and produce in common. The scarcity of jobs forces competition between racial and sexual groups, forcing them to push each other aside as they scrable for the crumbs created by an economy that produces two classes — the greedy and the needy. The tradgedy of the movement for women's rights and the movement for the rights of the Black people is that they have primarily focused on political rights rather than general economic ones. 
Just was as the old civil rights movement discovers today that the right to vote or the right to an integrated education are nullified by lack of economic equality, you in the women's movement may sadly discover that the equal rights amendment may mean for you what other equal rights meant for us: the equal right to be poor, the equal right to join the millions of unemployed, the equal right to have your tax dollars used here and abroad for subversion and terror, the equal right to join the millions of unemployed, the equal right to live in a country where 5% of the people have twenty per cent of the wealth and 20% of the people must share only 5 % of the wealth. 
That kind of equally guaranteed inequality must be fought against now, by building a massive movement of the disenherited of all races, sexes and classes, to insist that our bicentennial celebration can last more than a minute. 
In 1976, while the nation prepares to choose a new president, we have the opportunity now to make the campaigns a referendum on human rights. 
The demands for racial and sexual equality, for economic democracy must be forced upon the candidates who will come before you, seeking your support.
You must construct an agenda which will insist upon:

income and wealth redistribution through a tax structure that reduces the disparity between the needy and the greedy; 
the elimination of poverty through a program of real full employment 
free, adequate health care for us all, financed through the national treasury and not through profit making insurance companies; 
effective social control of monopoly, and 
national, regional or municipal ownership of vital services, operated for need and not for profit.

[The following is handwritten on upside down campaign letterhead.]
You stand on historic ground.
We stand before Tom Watson's statue. He stood against priviledge, and put together a massive coalition of Black and white Georgians, workers and farmers.
Like so many other such movements, it foundered on racism and bigotry, and vanished, never to be revised again.
[The following is typeset.]
These promise no perfect world, but do hold out the hope that we may create a system of laws and relationships between us that promise more than the present system of priviledge for only a few.
We ought all remind ourselves of some words from the past, from the late scholar W. E. B. DuBois, who said almost 100 years ago: 
""I believe in god who made of one blood all the races that dwell on earth. I believe that all, black, brown and white, are brothers and sisters, differing in no essential particular, but alike in soul, and in the possibility of infinite development.
I believe in service; humble. reverent service, from the blackening of boots to the whitening of souls, for work is heaven, idleness hell, and wages the well done that summoned all them that lanbor and are heavy laden, making no distinction between the Black sweating cotton hands of Georgia and the first families of Virginia, since all distinction not based on deed is devilish and not devine.
I believe in the prince of peace. I believe that war is murder. I believe that armies and navies are at bottom the tinsel and braggadocio of tinsel and wrong, and I believe that the wicked conquest of weaker and darker nations by nations white and stronger but foreshadows the death of their strength.
I believe in liberty for all, the space to stretch their arms and their souls, the right to breath and the right to vote, the freedom to choose their friends, to enjoy the sunshine, to ride on the railroad, uncursed by color, thinking, hoping, dreaming working as they will in a kingdom of god and love.
[The following is handwritten on the back of the previous page.]
What happens next.
The 3,000 gathered here have must be prepared to say to your Senators and Representatives that they cannot oppose equal rights in January and expect equal votes from us in June.
This crowd is young and white. It is too young and too white. It must reach out to encompass not just white and Black or male and female but old and young, straight and gay, but you must attract and win the women who gave me a rose last year, even though I lead the fight for what they thought was the breakup of the home, unisex toilets and homosexual marriage.

If you succeed in making an impact on the new administration, you will be the first group of spokespersons for the poor and powerless who have done so since the polls closed on November 2nd.
The election of a President from the rural, small town South and a Vice President from the small town Midwest ought to signal a new concern for the areas of your interest. Whether it does or not depends on you and your ability to transfer the policies on paper you agree on here to action in the White House, on Capitol Hill, and in the regional offices of the Federal apparatus in the South.
The South is poor people living in a rich land. It is Atlanta and Birmingham and Houston, but it is also Leflore County and Bluffton and Santee. It is Black and white people, but it is particularly rural Black people caught in the crunch between the decline of family farming and the upsurge of the cities. These are the Forgotten Americans, poor and impotent. These people - like many of you who are their spokesmen - believe almost naively in the political process as a means of solving their problems.
Last year saw the end of two hundred years of the American experiment and the beginning of four years of great promise.
Last November's rejection of eight years of Nixon and Ford showed that the electorate was ready for a change.
They were tired, they seemed to say, of callousness in the Capitol, of carelessness with people's lives.
They wanted a government that could be as good as they thought they were and elected a candidate who said he wanted the best.
Sixteen years ago, another Democratic administration came into office promising us the best and the brightest. This year's new faces in Washington's high places seem oddly reminiscent of those in 1961, as if they had been born again just for today. The new Cabinet is hardly more racially or sexually integrated than the one it replaces, and appears to belong to at least as many private clubs.
The new government's initial composition is a surprise only in that it was expected to be different; it was expected to reflect - in greater measure - the composition of the victory that put it into office.
91% of the Black people who voted on November 2, 1976 voted for the Carter/ Mondale team. These voters provided the margin of victory and more in 13 states, states whose electoral votes gave the winning side 216 of the 270 electoral votes they needed to win.
It is now entirely reasonable for these voters to expect their loyalty to be repaid, not just in putting their faces in high places, but by developing plans to eliminate 200 years of imposed pathology from their lives.
Over ten years ago, the noted sociologist Kenneth Clark described the Black ghetto as ""social, political, educational, and - above all - economic colonies. Their inhabitants are subject peoples, victims of greed, cruelty, insensitivity, guilt and fear of their masters.""
That description is sadly still true today. No election has changed it. No riots in the street have shifted it. No cries of 'freedom now' or 'Black Power' have made the slightest difference in the relationship between the colony and its masters, between serf and lord, between have and have-not.
Today's tragedy is both that things remain the same, or worse, but also that many believe them to have been radically altered.
The removal of the more blatant forms of American apartheid have made it easy for too many to believe today that Black people are really equal and free.
Nothing could be further from the truth.
The old sayings are still true. We are still last hired, first fired. We are still last in, first out. We are still poor out of proportion to our numbers, powerless despite our ability to elect Presidents, ignorant in spite of integrated schools, hungry regardless of integrated lunch counters.
A look at the first 76 years of this century are instructive. When the Twentieth Century began, Black people were slaves in every way but legally. Most of us could not vote. Nearly all of us went to segregated schools, and in the South, only a few months a year.
Most could not hope to become educated beyond high school, and almost none at the graduate level. Most worked as semi-skilled laborers. Few owned their own homes.
Seventy years later, much of this had changed. Most of us had escaped the farm for the city. Most of us were able to vote, even if we chose not to do so. Most of our children went to schools that were integrated by law, if segregated by fact. We had become doctors, lawyers, teachers, office holders - had spread ourselves across the spectrum of American employment.
Yet, even this progress is deceptive. In 1971, we were ten percent of the employed workers of America, but only 1 percent of the engineers, only 2 percent of physicians, only 3 percent of the managers and administrators, 6 percent of the craftsmen, as contrasted with 17 percent of the service workers, 20 percent of the laborers, and 50 percent of the household workers.
And we have constantly constituted twice as many of those who have had no job at all. These describe a people in permanent crisis, a crisis shown not just in figure and fact, but in the daily lives of millions for whom life has never been a crystal stair.
American Blacks have tried to escape this dilemma through prayer, protest and politics and have found that none of these alone can guarantee salvation.
In the 114 years since Abraham Lincoln freed the slaves, the fortunes of Black Americans have risen only to fall again, like opposite ends of a see-saw.
From Reconstruction until today, the lives of Americans whose skins are dark have been colored by racial discrimination.
Shortly after the beginning of this century, the late scholar W. E. B. Dubois set forth a method and goals for Black America. He said then, ""We must complain. Yes, plain, blunt complaint, ceaseless agitation, unfailing exposure of dishonestly and wrong—this is the ancient, unerring way to liberty and we must follow it...
""Next we propose to work. These are the things that Black men must try to do:

to press against the curtailment of our political rights;
to urge Negroes to vote intelligently and effectively;
to push the matter of Civil Rights;
to organize business cooperation;
to build school houses and increase the interest in education;
to bring Negroes and labor unions into mutual understanding;
to study Negro history;
to attack crime among us... to do all in our power by word and deed to increase the efficiency of our race, the enjoyment of its manhood rights and the performance of its just duties.

This is a large program. It cannot be realized in a short time... This is the critical time""
What was true for Dr. Dubois 72 years ago is sadly true for us today.
That prescription for our action must be coordinated with state and Federal action to halt the decay of the land and life of those millions who—by choice or by chance—live away from the skyscrapers and bright lights of the New South.
This region is special not just because of its history or its poverty—it is special because its people know what struggle is.
There is an expression you used to hear to describe a people who crowded each other out—they used to say they were like hogs at a trough.
In the excitement of the victory last November, too many of the people who should know better have been acting like hogs at a trough, eager to shoulder conscience aside to advance their own prospects.
That is sadly expectable. We have learned how to lead our horse to water, but we have not learned how to make him drink.
During the campaign, we kept hearing people tell us to get on the train before it was too late. Let me leave you with some other words from Dr. Dubois, who said, ""everyone wants to get on the train, but no one wants to know where the train is going.
Many of you here put this train on the track.
Be careful we don't end up lying down in front of it, or at the least, in the caboose where we've been since we started."

""We must complain. Yes, plain blunt complaint, ceaseless agitation, unfailing exposure of dishonesty and wrong — this is the ancient, unerring way to liberty and we must follow it....""
""Next we propose to work. These are the things that Black men must try to do:

9

to press against the curtailment of our political rights;
to urge Negroes to vote intelligently and effectively;
to push the matter of civil rights;
to organize business cooperation;
to build school houses and increase the interest in education;
to bring Negroes and labor unions into mutual understanding;
to study Negro history;
to attack crime among us.....to do all in our power by word and deed to increase the efficiency of our race, the enjoyment of its manhood rights and the performance of its just duties.""

""This is a large program. It cannot be realized in a short time....This is the critical time.""
What was true for Dr. DuBois 72 years ago is sadly true for us today.

[The following pages are handwritten.]
That prescription for our action must be coordinated with state and Federal action to halt the decay of the land and life of those millions who — by choice or by chance — live away from the skyscrapers and bright lights of the New South.
This region is special not just because of its history or its poverty — it is special because its people know what struggle is.
11
There is an expression you used to hear to describe a people who crowd each other out — they used to say they were like hogs at a trough.
In the excitement of the victory last November, too many of the people who should know better have been acting like hogs at a trough, eager to shoulder conscience aside to advance their own prospects.
12
That is sadly expectable. We have learned how to lead our horse to water, but we haven't learned how to make him drink.
During the campaign, we kept hearing people tell us to get on the train before it was too late. Let me leave you with some other words from Dr. Dubois, who said, ""everyone wants to get on the train, but no one wants to know where the train is going.""
13
Many of you here put this train on the track.
Be careful we don't end up lying down in front of it, or at the least, in the caboose where we've been since we started."

The presence of the sickle cell trait in 10% of the American Black population, and of sickle cell anemia itself in one of every 500 Black Americans is for most of us only added evidence that skin color arbitrarily determines how long we live, how much we earn and learn, and how soon we die. 
Listen if you will, to a description of what this particular disease does to the afflicted. 
A publication issued by the Department of Health, Education and Welfare tells us that “sickle cell anemia is frequently characterized by a state of chronic anemia, the presence of jaundice, recurrent episodes of pain called ‘crises’, an increased susceptibility to certain infections, growth retardation, and frequently a shortened life expectancy. It is passed from parent to offspring through a genetic inheritance pattern.” 
Not only is this paragraph a description of the sufferings of the victims of sickle cell anemia; it would serve as well to describe the lives of Black people living in the United States in 1979. 
If we aren’t personally anemic, our pocketbooks are; if we don’t have recurrent episodes of pain, I don’t know who does; and all Black Americans suffer from a shorter life expectancy and a greater susceptibility to disease and infection than other Americans do. 
2 
So in a perverse fashion, its expectable and understandable that Black people have sickle cell anemia; if we didn’t have it, America would have invented it, and made a special presentation of it to each of us at birth. 
But the movement of scattered groups throughout America to raise funds and to increase general public knowledge of this disease and its consequences is a hopeful sign in our lives; a sign of greater mental health, of greater community concern for our lives and the lives of those who come after us. 
It is important, therefore, to place the fight to eradicate sickle cell anemia in the general context of the struggle to remove all racial barriers from our lives; to insist that the 200-year-old struggle for life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness include the right to a life free race-based restrictions of all kinds.

In 1831, a young Frenchman, Alexis de Tocqueville toured the United States and wrote his classic Democracy in America. He described the wonders of this infant nation, the sovereignty of its people, the liberty of its press, the probable tyranny of the majority, our free institutions. In his chapter on ""The Present and Probable Future Condition of the Three Races Which Inhabit The Territory of the United States” he noted: 
""…..the destiny of the Negroes is in some measure interwoven with that of the Europeans. These two races are attracted to each other without intermingling; and they are alike unable entirely to separate or combine. The most formidable of all the ills which threatens the future existence of the Union, arises from the prescence of a Black population upon its territory…..
He later observes: ""…in those parts of the Union in which the Negroes are no longer slaves, they have in no wise drawn nearer to the whites. On the contrary, the predjudice of the race appears to be stronger in the States which have abolished slavery than in those where it still exists, and no where is it so intolerant as in those states where servitude has never been known.” 
Again later:……I do not regard the abolition of slavery as a means of warding off the struggle of the two races in the United States. The Negroes may long remain slaves without complaining; but if they are once raised to the level of free men, they will soon revolt at being deprived of all their civil rights; as they cannot become the equals of the whites, they will speedily declare themselves as enemies."" 
4
De Tocqueville was never optimistic about the outcome of this great struggle; indeed, he believed it inevitably would lead to chaos. 
Now, almost a century and a half later, the pessinism he expressed seems justified. 
Martin Luther King would be 50 years old this year. His death, 11 years ago at the hands of James Earl Ray and persons unknown, created a void in leadership in Black America that may never be filled. 
When he was murdered in 1968, it may have seemed that the major work of his life was finished. 
In the years of his leadership, Black Americans had won the right to vote, to participate in deciding public policy, to help elect to office the women and men who govern America’s towns and cities and states and even the nation itself. 
We had won the right to an integrated education, to learn and study side by side with other children, to become whatever our minds would lead us to. 
Access to an equal education would insure us an equal place at the starting line, a fair chance at being healthy, wealthy, and wise. 
But we mistakenly assumed that these victories would win the larger one, the chance at economic equality in the larger world, and 
5
equal chance to be spread fairly among the three classes that compose America, a uniform chance to be rich, confortable, or poor. 
But the eleven years since Dr. King’s death have served only to reinforce the disparity between rich and poor, and to further concentrate people of color at the bottom end of the scale.
[The following line is handwritten between paragraphs.]

When King was killed in 1968, the United States was at war with Vietnam. The country was divided among those who thought the war was just committment to a foreign — if corrupt — ally, and those who believed it an unwarranted interference into a civil war between competing political forces in Vietnan.
The American South was in turmoil too. Eight years of peaceful, nonviolent demonstrations had nearly ended; voting rights were reluctantly — and barely — enforced for the region’s Black population, and an uneasy quiet settled on the land. 
In the nation, riots had occurred in Newark, Los Angeles, Detroit and following King’s death, in nearly every American city. 
The Commission appointed by President Lyndon B. Johnson to study the cause and prescribe the prevention of future urban, racial disorder reported: 
“Unemployment is a key problem. It not only controls the present for the American Negro, but in a most profound way, it is creating the future as well.” 
6
And elsewhere, the Commission on Civil Disorders said: 
“Unlike the (European) immigrant, the Negro migrant found little opportunity in the city. The economy, by then matured, had little use for the unskilled labor he had to offer.” 
And again they reported: 
“The structure of discrimination has stringently narrowed opportunities for the Negro and restricted his prospects……….. Althought Negro men worked as hard as the immigrants, they were unable to support their families…..Pervasive discrimination and segregation in employment, education and housing (which) have resulted in the exclusion of great numbers of Negroes from the benefits of economic progress.” 
The Commission made recommendations to the President, the Congress and the nation which would, they said, “end the destruction and the violence, not only in the streets of the ghetto, but in the lives of people.” 
The Commission’s report was issued in 1968. Its first witness was Dr. Kenneth Clark, who told the Commissioners he had read reports of other racial riots in 1919 in Chicago, in Harlem in 1935 and again in 1943, and the Watts Riot report. They read, he said, like a “kind of Alice in Wonderland — with the same moving picture re-shown over and over agin, the same analysis, the same recommendations, the same inaction.”

1979 marks the 25th anniversary of Brown vs the Board of Education, Topeka.  
All other current civil rights gains, all other progress recorded since then stems from that decision that “the doctrine of separate but equal has no place.”1 
If the depression in 1929 — fifty years ago — had convinced America it was obliged to protect the well-being of all its citizens, the court decision in 1954 began to convince reluctant Americans that they would have to share their bounty, their knowledge and their world. 
For the American Black population, as Richard Kluger notes: “No more would he be a willing supplicant for the benefactions and discards of the master class; no more would he be a party to his own degredation. He was both thrilled that the signal for the demise of his class status had come from on high, and angry that it had taken so long and first extracted so steep a price in suffering.”2
In equal education, the cause from which the Brown decision graduated, we discover that the once solid south is now the most integrated section of the country, while the once liberal North still stubbornly and successfully insist on maintaining segregated schools. 
This twenty-five year-old process had almost been more painful than the results have been beneficial. From the very first, all deliberate speed meany any conceivable delay. The burden of bringing justice to American education fell almost exclusively on the small shoulders of Black children and the impecunious pocketbooks of their teachers. 
8
From the beginning, these children were cursed and spat upon. Soldiers of the United States Army had to escort these American citizens into American schools. They were bussed away from their neighborhoods to protect the sanctity of someone else’s, were bussed more often and for longer distances, and once installed in school, over the objections of nearly every white person in their communities, were expelled more often than their numbers — or performance — deserved. Competency tests are now turning their schools into production line educational factories rather than the centers of learning they were intended to be. 
In the South, the man who’d been principal of Booker T. Washington High School quickly became the assistant-to-the-assistant-to-the assistant at Stonewall Jackson High School. The Institute for Southern Studies has estimated that the school integration process has cost the Black South 57,000 teachers who would be working now if the nunbers of Black theachers had continued to parallel the numbers of Black children in school. 
Nationally, the Institute says, Black Americans lose more than $3 billion dollars these teachers could — and schould contribute to our communities. 
In 1977, Black Americans had fewer 25 to 29-year-old high school graduates than whites the same ages had 25 years ago. 
More Blacks dropped out of high school in 1977 than enrolled in college. 
Only 30% of all Black college students are enrolled in the historically Black public and private colleges, but these schools still graduate more than 50% of all Blacks with college degrees. From whatever school, a black boy with a college degree will earn only $150 more per year than a white boy with a high school diploma. 
9
By almost any other measure, the position of Black America has worsened. The gap between white and Black unemployment is as high today as it has ever been. Our unemployment rates equal those of the Great Depression. In both relative and absolute terms, Black income has fallen behind income levels for whites. 39% of all our families are headed by women. 44% of all our children live in female headed households. While the numbers of elderly white poor have gone donw, the numbers of elderly Black poor have gone up. One fourth of all our families are the recipients of public assistance. 
Because so many of us are poor, it is no surprise that our health status is poor as well. We are medically underserved. To equalize the proportion of Black to white physicians in the United States, Black America would have to produce 27,000 new physicians overnight, a comforting thought only if you assume that white Americans are sicker than we are. At the present rate of medical school graduations for Blacks, it will take 125 years to equalize the humbers of Black and white doctors in the United States. 
The infant mortality gap between Blacks and whites has increased. Data from the United States Bureau of the Census tell us that Black men lost a year of expectable life in the decade of the 1960s. If white life expectancy rates remain constant — which they won’t — and the Black death rate continues to declien at the present rate, it will take 80 years for the races to reach parity in the cemetary, for blacks to live as long as whites do. 
Black death rates for hypertension are 235% higher than for whites; for tuberculosis, 388% higher. For homocide, the Black death rate is 642% higher than for whites. 
I could go on. You may not know the figures, but you surely know the people, and you know as they do that their lives will never be a crystal stair. 
10
These flat and lifeless statistics are reflective of real human beings, breathing women and men, the promise of our future, the products of benign concern and malignant neglect, the result of 200 years of official carelessness with the life chances of one-tenth of the nation’s population. Here is the vast army of the unwanted, the products of assembly line education, of a welfare system designed to destroy families, of a government that substitutes style for substance, of a president who knows the words of our hymns and not the numbers on our paychecks. 
The lives of the least of these is reflective of the chances we all have to live lives above the margin. 
Our first priority must be to solidify the gains already won before inflation and recession completely wash them away. The old story of last hired, first fired; the semi-successful attempts by the Nixon-Ford administration to roll back the second reconstruction; the continued inability of Carter and company to make any real dent in the downward spiral of joblessness and poverty, the backlash of Bakke and the uncertainty of Weber mean that we must give precedence to staying where we are, to excaping from the see-saw style that shows blacks gains in one direction canceled by Black losses in another. 
Much of our salvation lies within our own grasp, independent of the political fortunes of men and parties. It will be found in our willingness to revive the spirit of the sixties, not by marches and protests alone, but by accepting the principle that struggle and sacrifice are a constant part of our lives, not just a style to be abandoned because fashion shifts or retoric changes. 
On our way to the middle position between where we were and where we want to be, something seems to have happened to us all. 
11
On our way to school, we forgot young girls with spittle dripping from their dresses who walked that lonely block past screaming harpies to put an end to the separate and unequal education forced upon us. 
When we forgot to vote at all on election day, or cast a vote for Candidate “A” because Reverend “B” told us to, we forgot that too many died to give us choices and not chances at the polls. We’ve forgotten that social committment is not measured by the length of your hair or the trickiness of your handshake; political action is neither retorical or sartorial. We’ve forgotten Frederick Douglass’ injunction that “there is no progress without struggle.” We have passed the two-hundredeth anniversary of our society’s organization without purpose or commitment to anything but our individual selves. 
In far too many ways, we are like the rest of the population, too eager to embrace the new and sacrifice the old. 
In the United States of America in the last quarter of the twentieth century, we are surrounded by turmoil and change all across the globe. 
In Zimbabwe Rhodesia, the struggle for independence continues. 
In Nicaguarga, a concerted struggle by the people has forced a tyrant out and democracy in. 
Old assumptions about old arrangements are being challenged and found wanting; change is being forced, often at the point of a gun, on those reluctant to share the power they gained in illegitimate ways. 
Here at home we are the guilty bystanders, indifferent to our own condition, uncaring about our slow slide backward into history. 
12
It is no accident that the President of the United States has successfully managed to absorb the rhetoric of those who believe that less is more, that society cannot and should not be organized to successfully guarantee our lives, our liberty, and our pursuit of happiness. 
Two hundred years ago, this country found itself locked in bloody battle over just these principles, and if history is any guide, we felt that the battle had been won. Now the struggle is being mounted again, and this time even the illusion of victory may escape us. 
And old blues singer once said that some men kill with bulletts: others kill with the stroke of a pen. The armies of Concord and Lexington used bullets and powder; the current battle uses no guns, but leaves just as many wasted lives in its wake. 
The first shots in today’s wars were fired in 1968, when the forces of reaction and repression elected one of their own to the White House and re-elected him four years later. 
Assisted by an increasingly impotent congress, they engineered a series of slowdown, cut-backs, reverses in revenue and shifts in sharing and a gradual but real retreat from concern for the powerless. 
In 1976, when a candidate promised to be as good as we thought we were, an egotistical and self-centered nation jumped at the chance to sanctify the White House. 
Now almost four years later, we are preparing to make that chouce once again. And Black Americans, at least, find ourselves as ill prepared today as we have been at any time in the past. 
13
The facts are real. While Black people in the Southern United States have a generally good record of political performance, nationally we are in real danger of counting ourselves out instead of helping to choose who will govern us into the ’80s. 
In 1960, in a close election between John F. Kennedy and Richard M. Nixon, 39 million Americans, Black and white, failed to vote. In 1964, when Lyndon Johnson defeated Barry Goldwater in a landslide election, 43 million Americans chose not to choose. In 1968 the figures rose to 47 million, and in 1972, 63 million Americans stayed at home and let the rest of us choose between Richard Nixon and George McGovern. 
More frightening for us in 1972 was this — fewer than one-half of the fourteen million Blacks who could have said “No” to Nixon were even registered to vote.
TwoSix years later, in the Congressional elections of 1978, only 37% of the registered Black voters cast their votes to help select the do-nothing Congress of the United States. 
Based on Census figures, I can tell if you are a registered voter or not. If you are between 45 and 64 years old, a college graduate, have lived in the same place for more than ten years, if you have an annual income of more than 10,000, then you vote with some regularity. But if you are between 18 and 24, if you have a high school or elementary school education, if you live on a farm in the South and make less than $5,000 a year, then you don’t vote, and you don’t count, and no one counts on you. 
And if you have all of the qualifications of a voter and none of the qualities, then you’re simply a fool. 
14
In 1968, if only ten more Black voters per Black precinct across the nation had cast their ballots:

Richard Nixon would not have been elected President
Berger, Blackmon, Powell and Rehnquist would not now be on the Supreme Court. 

In 1976, if only 3,000 Black voters in Ohio had stayed at home on election day, Carter would have lost Ohio, 25 electoral votes, and the Presidency of the United States. 
While increased voter registration and participation are obviously needed in Black America, a word needs saying about voter education as well. 
A survey conducted last fall in Ebony Magazine is frightening in its implications. Among its target group, those 18 to 29-year-old Blacks who are our future, 48% did not know who Mary McLeod Bethune was; 51% did not know who Paul Robeson was, and more than 50% did not know who Vernon Jordan and Benjamin Hooks were. Only 37% of them believed in voting. In 1977, 51% of this group was politically impotent; only a few more than half believed it important to vote at all. Only 12% had attended a political rally or speech; only 5% had worked for a political party or candidate, and 27%, the largest active group, had expressed their racial consciousness and political activism by signing a petition. 
So we are preparing for the 1980 elections, in which a President and Vice-President, one third of all the members of the United States Senate and 435 members of the United States House of Representatives will be chosen, by planning to leave our best and brightest at home. 
15
No one can say with any certainity now who the candidates will be, but we can assume without fear of contradition that the election will be held. 
And unlike the revolution, it will be televised, or many of you would never know it happened. 
Its not too soon now to begin preparation; in fact, it may nearly be too late. 
We must first overcome our inability to effectively organize ourselves into political and economic blocs. We must maximize our minority status, must build and support and salvage our own institutions, must act as if we are really brothers and sisters instead of alienated strangers in a world where dogs eat dogs and men stand on each others’ shoulders to insure they’ll move upward singley, if at all. 
Think back, if you will, to the Presidential campaign of three years ago. 
A fresh, new face came out of the South, attacked eight years of reactionary Republican rule, promised to give our people jobs and to give us a government as good as we are. 
Now three years later the United States is preparing to choose a president again. 
The President we elected then now tells us that unemployment will be 8.2% during his re-election campaign year and that the rate of inflation will be just as high. 
Unemployment statistics for blacks, of course, are always twice the national rate. 
16
We suffer additionally from a health care system where costs run rampant and quality is beyond control. We Americans pay more of our gross national product for medicine than any other Western society, yet rank 15th among those nations in infant mortality rates. 
The food we eat and pay so dearly for is the product of a system that pays billions in subsidies to agribusinessmen — not the small family farmers who marched on Washington this year. 
The homes we live in are priced beyond the reach of the average family because of monetary policies designed — we are told — to fight inflation. 
The fuel that runs our cars and heats our homes comes from a system directly and indirectly subsidized by you and me for over 50 years. This corporate welfare has vreated the most wasteful and vulnerable energy system in the indus-rial world, a system free from the normal restraints of anti-trust and anti-monopoly prosecution. Protected from foreign competition by oil import quotas, allowed to control production and to set supply at the most profitable level, big oil and its allied industries created a highway system and automobile industry that ignored repeated warnings that there was not enough of this precious fluid to last forever. 
These four sectors of our economy — fuel, food, housing and health — are crucial to the living standard of each American. 
A farm program which encouraged family farmers to produce to their limit, encouraging abundance rather than planned and expensive scarcity; a national health plan that made real the constitutional guarantee of life lived freely and happily for each American, and a mandatory credit allocation program to house the middle class and working poor would do more than Presidential rhetoric 
17
to halt inflation in these necessities. 
The costs of such a program — and more — can be met by undertaking real reform of federal tax laws to eliminate discrimination in favor of the wealthy. The current tax revolt movement has a real base in real anger, but is misdirected toward underfunded but sesparately needed services for the poor. When those who have a little fight with those who have almost nothing, only those with great resources stand to win. 
Most necessary to the process of bringing democracy to America is to develop an informed and organized electorate, a collection of women and men who will vote their interests at the ballot box. 
There are 15 million voting age Blacks in the United States who make up 10 per cent of the national electorate. Many are concentrated key industrial states with large blocks of electoral votes. Blacks are 10 per cent of the voting age population in 64 congressional districts; at least 20 per cent of the voting age population in 89 cities with populations of 50,000 or more, and 50 per cent or more of the voting age population in 103 counties, mainly in the Southern United States. 
Taht enormous potential must be energized and educated to do more than vote for a many who knows the words to our hymns; we need a candidate who also knows the numbers on our paychecks. 
For the moment, the choice for progressive voters in 1980 is a choice between the incumbent and the impudent, between grits and Zen, between broken promises and fantasy promised. 
While we wait for another to come along, or decide to make a choice among those available now, let us remember some words from the past from that great scholar 
18
and teacher, W.E.B. DuBois, who said more than a half century ago: 
[Typeset changes.]
“I believe in God who made of one blookd all the races that dwell on the earth. I believe that all men, Black, brown and white are brothers, varying through time and opportunity, in form and gift and feature, but differing in no essential particular, and alike in soul and in the possibility of infinite development.” 
“Especially do I believe in the Negro race; in the beauty of its genius, the sweetness of its soul, and its strength in that meekness which shall inherit this turbulent earth.” 
""I believe in pride of race and lineage itself; in pride of self so deep as to scorn injustice to other selves; in pride of lineage so great as to despise no man’s father; in pride of race so chivalrous as neither to offer bastardy to the weak nor beg wedlock of the strong, knowing that men 
19
may be brothers in Christ, even though they be not brothers-in-law."" 
“I believe in service: humble, reverent service, from blackening of boots to the whitening of souls: for work is heaven, idleness hell, and wages I the ‘well done’ of the master who summoned all them that labor and are heavy laden, making no distinction between the Black sweating cotton hands of Georgia and the first families of Virginia, since all distinction not based on deed is devilish and not divine.” 
""I believe in the Devil and his angels, who wantonly work to narrow the opportunity of struggling human beings, especially if they be Black; who spit in the faces of the fallen, strike them that cannot strike again, believe the worst and work to prove it, hating the image which their maker stamped on a brother’s soul. I believe in the prince of peace. I believe that war is murder. I believe that armies and navies are at bottom the tinsel and braggadacio 
20
of oppression and wrong, and I believe that the wicked conquest of weaker and darker nations by nations white and stronger but foreshadows the death of that strength."" 
“I believe in liberty for all men; the space to stretch their arms and their souls; the right to breathe and the right to vote; the freedom to choose their friends, enjoy the sunshine and ride on the railroads, uncursed by color; thinking, dreaming, working as they will in a kingdom of God and love.” 
""I believe in the training of children Black even as white; the leading out of little souls into the green pastures and beside the still waters, not for truth alone lest we forget, and the sons of the fathers, like Esau, for mere meat barter their birthright in a mighty nation. Finally, I believe in patience: patience with the weakness of the weak and the strength of the strong, the prejudice of the 
21
ignorant and the ignorance of the blind; patience with the tardy triumph of joy and the chastening of sowwor; patience with God."""

To the members of the class of 1971:
It is traditional at a ceremony like this one to tell you that you are embarking on a great journey through an uncharted sea steering with the compass of your education, sailing under sails raised by your own brilliance, but that, however difficult your course, you are to remember that we are all of us - Black and white, rich and poor - all in the same boat. That may be true, but it’s leaking under Black people’s seat!
You are about to leave here at a time of social & moral turmoil.
You are entering into the real world outside of these ebony towers at an interesting time. You are the spiritual descendants of those young people who 31 years ago, coming from schools very much like this one, demonstrated that young people could make a difference, first at lunch counters and bus stations, ] 2 then at county courthouses and voting booths all over this the dark regions of
2
the country.
Throughout the decade of the ‘60s, young people the age that most of you are now, faced police dogs and fire hoses and midnight murderers and jails in order to bring a small taste of democracy to this region of the country.
And over these years, a certain sort of progress occurred.
But there is always difficulty in measuring what social scientists call “progress.” This is particularly true of Black people, because we are a people on a see-saw - we go up in one direction and down in another.
The 1960s were years of one kind of incredible swift movement for us: we moved from social and political slumber into mild activism into open - if shortlived - rebellion.
Since the beginning of the last half of that decade, we have ] 3 struggled through a continuing period of evaluation, attempting
3
to discover not just who we are and where we have come from, but where it is we want to go.
That is a tall question, and its discussion, particularly among those many, many sympathizers and empathizers of the Black movement, occupies more time than the achieving of any goal.
The trouble is that many people talk about revolution, but do nothing about it; they talk about reform, but do nothing about it.
We live in an age where social activism is measured by whether one wears the right button or can mouth the latest slogan - even President Nixon can say “power to the people”.
Social justice today is all too often measured by length of hair or thickness of smoke. America's youth have come to idolize Woodstock while ignoring Watts.
Human responsibility is measured on a scale which charts whether one adheres to the ""Newton"" or ""Cleaver"" positions, and

You are - in a way certified by your graduation today - becoming citizens of the larger world, but of course (page 2, page 3, page 4, all underlined material)
Your job is to ignore the foolish preoccupations that have captured the attention of your white contemporaries. You cannot afford to attend a Woodstock while the nation still tolerates Watts. You cannot afford to show more interest in macro-biotic diets, (page 6, underlined material)

This every four years celebration ought to mean something special to all American young people, who like their sisters and brothers in Georgia for the last near quarter-century, will have a chance to say who will and will not govern all of us from 1972 to 1976.
That is always a difficult decision to make for anyone in any year. It will be especially difficult next year, because of the times we live in.
These are indeed times that try men's souls, and times that cannot possibly be understood unless one has a real appreciation of the forces that shape each of us.
There are two continuing factors in all American life - racism and war.
These factors find their firmest advocates in the facist fascimilies of Nixon and Agnew, the twins of confusion and chaos.
Their behavior in the last two weeks is symptomatic of their behavior since they took office, and shed much light on the national malady.
Mr. Nixon's proposed visit to the Republic of China, for example, ought to give real pause to those of us who had long believed that mainland China posed the only effective threat to America's neo-colonial agressive desires on the undeveloped world. The fear, of course, ifs
2
that these two super-powers will develop an incestous relationship that will begin by sabatouging the heroic 25-year struggle of the Vietnamese people to rule themselves, and which will end in China and the United States replacing the Soviet Union and the United States as the two greatest threats to international peace and harmony.
The Vice-President, not to be outdone, chose the one European country - Facist Spain - that exactly fits his politics, to make disparaging remarks about Black leadership in America. This was shortly after he had spent the better part of his African tour watching hippopatami - or is it hippopatamuses - copulate. The Vice-President suggested that we ought to emulate African leaders like Jomo Kenyatta. Well, if he is willing to continue playing ""white settler,"" I am more than eager to play ""Mau-Mau"" with him.
On a state-wide level we appear to be doing better than we did in the recent past. Our city government on occasions does quite well. We are sorely lacking, in this part of Georgia, at any rate, in the quality of congressional leadership. We have here to do with a plastic congressman, a man who believes he can tell if he represents his constituents be sending them questionaires asking if they still beat their wives, and who is more concerned about ""cost over-runs"" on an OEO contract held by a consulting firm I used to be a partner of than he is by ""cost over--runs"" in the billions by Lockheed of Georgia.
The first order of business for young people interested in government ought to be to permanently retire this man from government mis-service, to make his pay back the over $150,000 that he has stolen from the federal treasury under the false pretense of being a Congressman,
3
and to insure that the people who live in what is now Georgia's 5th congressional district have someone else in Washington looking after their interests.
But government means politics to me. And politics usually means black politics to me. I can't help that. Race has colored my life.
And race continues to color the lives of thiousands of Georgians and millions of Americans.
In this vein Tthose who read the Atlanta newspapers were treated this week to an alarming juxtaposition of news stories and editorials. The cry of alarm over the proposed rapem of the Chattahoochie is of particular interest to me Black Atlantans. Where were all of these concerned citizens when Atlanta's West Side was being raped by apartment complex after apartment complex, by public housing heaped on top of public housing. Did the citizens of Morningside care when dynamite blasts from the construction of Interstate-20 West dropped huge concrete chunks through the roofs of some of Atlanta's nicer black homes . ? Where were they when a 2 square blocks of single family, middle income homes a block from my house were destroyed to build a new Kennedy School while Vine City's overcrowded slums remain remained standing? They were probably out boating on the Chattahoochie.
To fully understand fully politics, especially the politics of race, it is necessary to dispel some of the myths of Black progress. Despite the highly visible advancement of some black people in recent years, it must be understood that the objective situation of most Black people, relative to whites, has either remained unchanged or has deterioated.
4
Infant and maternal deaths for Blacks have increased in urban areas not just relative to white death rates, but also relative to the horrendous Black death rates of the '400 '40s, '50s, and early '60s.
Black unemployment as a percentage of all unemployment is rising, particularly for black youth. Althoguh Although poverty is being reduced overall, Black poverty as an incidence of all poverty has risen steadily since 1959. The gap in dollar income between blacks and whites has continued to widen since 1959.
The question, of course, is what's to be done? And more particularly, what's to be done by people like yourselves, who simply because of your race, will and do have access of positions of power and influence undreamed of by Black young people your age.
First, you must have a real understanding of the currents in the national and local Black community regarding Black politics.
I am one of 1800 elected Black officials in the United States. Although the practice of politics is increasingly scorned in the United States, it a pleasure to be one. It is a pleasure because I belong to the world's second oldest profession. There is an increasing interest in the national and local Black community in the art of politics. For example, it is increasing clear to Black Atlantans that no white policeman will ever be disciplined for engaging in the kind of brutality that every policeman knows is rampant against black policemen people until we control this city, its mayor, and the board of aldermen. Nationally, it is felt that there will never be political solutions to the difficulties Black people suffer from until we can rid ourselves of the foolish dependence we have had on the Democratic Party since the days when Franklin Roosevelt was President.
That is what, locally as well as nationally, there are strategies
5
being devised to deal with both of these difficulties.
On a national level, Black politicians we are trying to insure that the black delegates who do go to the Democratic Convention in Miami in 1972 go as representatives of Black people, and not as the junior associates of organized labor or the already committed servants of any of the too many candidates for the Democratic nomination.
This strategy will include running black candidates as favorite sons - or favorite daughters - in many of the 23 primary states next years, with especial attention being given to those states where the Black voters has made the difference between victory and defeat for state-wide candidates.
On a local level, the strategy would include making a determined attempt to capture every municipal office available in 19723. This ought not be viewed as a racist strategy, incidentally. When your fathers and uncles grandfathers were running this city and state for their own pleasure for so many years, none of them thought it odd that no Black people were included, and none of them thought it racIsts that white made right. This is simply a fulfillment of the old biblical prophecy that ""the first shall be last, and the last shall be first.""
Agian, we come back to the central question - what will you do?
In simple terms, you must be honest, upright, concerned members of your community, interested in the civic affairs and civic health of your state.
You must not fall victim to the same charades that have been so successful in the past - the myth that things will get better be-
cause you wish them so.
6
cause you wish them so.
Men have never done the right thing for the right reason - they must instead be made to do right. That we why have laws and policemen and jails and judges.
[Handwritten insert at top of page indicated for this location.] You must involve yourselves in politics, voter registration
What you must do to help solve what has erroneously been called the Negro problem is to take a cue from a great Black spokesman of 100 years ago, Frederick Douglass:
He said then: ""There is not now and never has been a Negro problem in the United States, but rather a great white problem. The Negro has as little to do with the cause of the problem as he has to do with its cure. But how - the people who cause the problem want to know - can their problem be solved . ?
""Let the white people of the North and South conquer their predjudices. Let them cultivate kindsness and humanity. ( Let them ) banish the idea that one class must rule over another. ( Let them ) recognize rthe fact that the rights of the humblest of citizens are as worthy of recognition as the rights of the highest, and your rpoblem will be solved, and whatever may be in store for you in the future, whether prosperity or adversity, whether you have foes without or foes within, whether there shall be peace or war ( if you will only live your lives ) based on the eternal principles of truth, justice and humanity, with no class having cause for complaint or greivance, then your Republic shall stand and flourish forever.""

I must state then that I come not to join or fight whatever battles here exist between whatever forces of evil and good, but simply to discuss the topic assigned to me.
If there is any difficulty in the relationship between the suburban newspaper -- here, in the suburbs of Atlanta or Dallas or Chicago or Tulsa -- and the black community -- it is no different from the relationship -- or lack of it -- between any news media anywhere and black people wherever we live.
And that is simply that we have no relationship to the media ] 2 at all, except as consumers of its end product. We are not likely to be found in the typesetters, truck drivers, reporters, editors, proofreaders, and most important, in the owners.
We are, however, some few of the readers and what we read is what needs immediate discussion now. Because we constitute some few of the readers of the suburban press, and because therefore majority America constitutes the majority of that readership, and because this majority is the majority that decides how we shall live and die, your coverage of and us and your relationship to us is a especial importance to us.
[I am not prepared tonight to argue that]
Nearly 100 years ago, the greatest scholar Black America has ever produced, W. E. B. DuBois, predicted that ""the problem of the 20th Century would be the problem of the color line.""
10 100 years later the current issue of PLAYBOY carries a ] 3 poll that reveals that only 35% of today's college students -- primarily white, middle class, the sons and daughters ofthe men who own and write for all of America's newspapers, the same generation that is told every June can save the world -- only 35% of the saviors of mankind are ""very worried"" about race relations and 20% were not ""worried""at all.
Only Lyndon Johnson believed all the polls he read, and we all know where that led him, but I believe this one. I believe it because I travel to the college campuses these young people attend and I talk with them. I believe this poll because I see their lack of interest in the all-consuming issue of the globe reflected in their own inactivity, and in their parent's far worse attitudes toward race. I believe it because I see the government of the United States propose a policy of ""benign neglect"", a policy which American Blacks ] 4 would argue has been in effect for 352 years.
[As the poll is true, so then]
The poll is true partially because people become what they read, as well as what they eat and drink and breathe, and the pol l is true because these young people, their pafents, their younger brothers and sisters, all of whom will have something to say about the relationship between the races in this country, have generally read things that are not true.
They are not catastrophic lies that come from some American Geobbles (sp?) but smaller lies that do the same damage in another way.
In brief, people get some of their information from the print media; information that they transalate into the political decisions they make. Their information has been faulty, and this has helped to impair their decision making ability.
(Parenthetically, I do not intend to place all of the ] 5 responsibility for 352 years of actual and psychological slavery at your doorsteps; I want you, however, to shoulder your portion of the burden).
Let us move from the general to the specific.
Throughout the entire decade of the '60, white Americans -- living in Scarsdale, New York or Stump Hollow, Tennessee -- read in their newspapers that Black Americans were moving ""too fast""
Martin Luther King was considered a dangerous near radical by the American press until his death; the Montgomery bus boycott ""an illegal restraint of trade""; the 1963 March on Washington an ""exercise in government by mob.""
Malcolm X was considered an irresponsible ""hatemonger""; with two Anglo-Saxon words, Stokeley Carmichael became an ""incindiary firebrand!"" ] 6
When the Student Nonviolnet Coordinating Committee said in 1965 that the war against the people of Vietnam was wrong, the Washington Post said we were foolish and stupid. When I asked the New York Times a month ago why they had no reporters covering a dramatic voter registration drive in Mississippi, and several covering the best of white America wallowing in the mud, getting spaced on drugs in a Louisiana [cop] cow pasture at a pop festival, a desk man told me that the festival was news.
I suggest that the Times and the Post are symptomatic of both the best and the worst American journalism; that their evils are reflected in your type.
That evil has been the steady stream of propaganda directed at the reading public, convincing them that a people who lived at the bottom of the barrel had no special greivance, at least not one that ] 7 wouldn't wait a decade or more for a solution.
Again I caution that I do no expect a newspaper serving suburban Westchester, New York, to cover a voter registration rally in Port Gibson, Mississippi. I do expect that periodically, more often than on the anniversary of Dr. King's death, your readers can have a pointed reminder that the number one problem of this nation -- indeed of this world -- is race.
I should like to have your constant readers know that black Americans are actually worse off now than we were before ten years ago.
Some of your papers may have printed an Associated Press or New York Times News Service Story sent out about July 28th. It reported that things ""despite a decade of substantial gains, black people in America still remain far behind whites in most social and economic areas."" ] 8
It did not report the following:
(attached speech, page 1, from ""when a black child is born......... to page 2 complete)
Those figures, and the reasons why are what you ought to give your readers when they read something about us.
The reasons why are complex, to be sure. If your papers were The Black Panther or Muhhamad Speak want an easy answer, you could run, just under your masthead, ""We are the Enemy"" but your readers would soon demand more.
They should have been told by you that Judges Haynesworth and Carswell were incompetents. If they were, I apologize. They should be told by you that Richard Nixon and John Mitchell have thrown the slow, but steady, progress of integrated schools in the South into chaos. If they were, I apologize. They should have told ] 10 by you that part of the answer to New York's staggering welfare load can be found in your own promotional material -- the lines that read ""an increasing number of major corporate headquarters are located in the area."" You might tell your readers that this is more than a quick bus ride from Harlem or Bedford Stuveysant. If you have, I apologize. You might examine the voting records of your congressmen on crucial issues affecting black people, not just the final vote, but the votes on amendments as well. If you have done so, I apologize.
In brief, you ought to tell your readers that black people are still in the same boat, only it's now it's beginning to leak under our seat.
You ought to tell them that part of this evil exists in their towns and villages and suburbs, and that they and their governments bear some responsibility for eradicating it.
They ought to be told, in brief, [the same kind of] that things are wrong, that theoretically, at least, they can be made right, that an aroused citizenry and an educated populace is one weapon in that struggle.
You are the schoolbooks to educate that populace, and you ought to be the clarion call that ariunsed that citizenry. If you are not, then you have failed not just your readers, but your profession, your nation, and your planet.

Dear Mr. Bond:
Tom did remember ""parva, parva, etc."" In fact, he remembers the whole thing, or led me to believe so.
He sends his greetings and I enclose my own plus the copy of your speech. Thank you for trusting me with it.

The winds of changes blow hard and fast among young people all across the globe.
The phenomenon of youthful activism is common to every nation, democratic or tyrant led, Black and white.
In Asia, in Africa, in the Americas, in Europe -- everywhere there are people, there are young people, and everywhere there are young people, there is turmoil.
The turmoil takes various forms in various lands: the red guards in the People's Republic of China, the Zengakuren, the militant youth in Japan, the early sit-in movement of the American South that blossomed into student activism across the continent -- all these have added to the rising tide of youthful participation in the affairs of the nations of the world.
But youthful activity in each of these nations has been only
2
sporadic, rising to meet and grapple with a specific issue, while the usual eventual outcome is a cessation of involvement or protest or militance, and a return to the status quo.
Nonetheless, young people have played an important role in the struggle of man to better his condition.
It was young Black people in Ghana in 1950, when Ghana was still the Gold Coast, who helped launch her move toward independence.
South American students played a key role in stopping dictators in their countries, particularly Peron in Argentina, in the early '50s. Students in Cuba were a vital part of the overthrow of the Dictator Batista. It was a student demonstration in Hungary in 1956 that helped trigger the Hungarian Revolt.
It was young Black students in the Southern United States who through their bravery and daring helped break the back of legal discrimination against Black people, and who set the example of
3
student activism for an entire generation of white college students.
In the school year 67-68 alone, the French paper Le Monde carried 2,125 articles on youth revolts or disorders on six continents.
But throughout the history of youthful activism, there has been this constant ebb and flow. It is almost as if young people are exactly the worst their elders have always believed about them: capable of great idealism and emotion, but unable to sustain any long range commitment to overthrowing evil and establishing a just order.
Too many of the young are just that, and that is why, in each of the fifty United States, the term student activism has an often hollow ring. That is why some of the young people who battled in cotton fields for the right to vote and at lunch counters for the right to vote and at lunch counters for the right to eat are not to be found when the issue becomes the right to work and live or the right to rule yourself.
That is why on college campuses that once rang with slogans
4
calling for power to the people you now discover more interest in music, drugs, and macrobiotic diets and the salving powers of astrology, the romantic rhetoric of revolution, and the enobling sacrifice of self induced poverty that you can discover any real interest in improving the condition of man through social and political action.
That is why you here today cannot afford the foolish preoccupations that divert so many summer soldiers from a battle that will probably last for many winters more.
That is why you must be prepared to struggle, in a political fashion, not just for immediate civil rights for young people here, now, and today, but for the extension of full manhood rights to all people everywhere for all time.
Most crucial of the civil rights is the right to vote. It is an article of faith among informed persons that the age of majority is
5
lower now than it ever was, and young men and women become young men and women sooner than they did ten or even five years ago.
The common argument put before the U.S. Congress is that if any one is old enough to fight, he certainly is old enough to vote. That argument has its weaknesses, the most obvious being that only men are presently drafted into military service, so that if young men are to vote because they fight, then women must be denied the vote because they do not.
Therefore, the vote has been extended to youth not for reasons of the likelihood of their killing, or being killed, but because youth today, men and women, are of an age to decide whether anyone ought to kill or be killed at all.
This new tool -- new in the hands of people who have not yet determined what, if any, worth it has -- must be used carefully.
It is quite popular among many of the youth who have never voted to demonstrate that things are in bad shape despite the
6
number of people who have been voting to date and that therefore nothing will change if a few new people now exercise the franchise.
Hopefully, that is because none of us who have voted to date have had your concern, your idealism, your interest in seeing that the political process became what it ought to be: a means through which people solve their problems and govern themselves.
It only becomes this through the infusion of new blood and new ideas, and through a long commitment by persons like yourself to the notion that change for the better never comes because we wish it so, only because we make it so.
That cannot be done by simply trooping to the ballot box for every election. One can have a perfect record for casting votes with never a thought about what or whom the votes go for.
Because you are young, because the education explosion has made you more knowledgeable than your elders, because this world will be
7
yours long after the people who messed it up have gone, then you must rise to the challenge to make it a better place for us all.
You can do this, not by mouthing rhetoric that will be gone with the wind, but by becoming an active part of the affairs that move about you.
This means that your interest must be great enough to cover questions ranging from whether a twenty-foot alley receives a street light to international complications that may turn out all of the lights all over this world.
Once again, you cannot bring this kind of leadership to your neighbors by telling them you know what is wrong -- the odds are that they knew what was wrong before you got here, and that they have had a good appreciation of how to set things right for some time.
Therefore you must be prepared to work not just for them, but with them, so as to insure that your superior knowledge of theories and strategies can be tempered with a bit of common sense.
8
You must also be ready to accept the responsibility for your actions, and the actions you urge on others.
The beauty of the late Martin Luther King was that he never asked anyone to do that which he would not do himself; never asked for suffering he would not, him and in the end, finally did, endure himself, and always stood ready to let the forces of oppression know that he would not turn and hide, but would face them like the man he was.
You have gathered to discuss the rights of minors. Remember if you will that today's minority is tomorrow's majority, that what in New York or Paris or Rome or Johannesburg looks like a few becomes the many when viewed world-wide.
Remember that the people who have been directing the affairs of colored peoples across the globe cannot do so much longer, at
9
least not with the however unwillingly granted consent of those peoples, and that this struggle will continue even without your presence.
But by your presence here, you have demonstrated you will be in the struggle tomorrow and the day after and the year after that, and that you will take as your slogan some words written nearly one hundred years ago by the greatest spokesman people of African descent ever had, Dr. W. E. B. DuBois.
Dr. DuBois said:
""I believe in God who made of one blood all the races that dwell on earth. I believe that all men — Black and white and Brown — are brothers, varying, through time and opportunity, in form and gift and feature, but differing in no essential particular, and alike in soul and in the possibility of infinite development.
Especially do I believe in the Negro race; in the beauty of
10
its genius, the sweetness of its soul, and its strength in that meekness which shall inherit this turbulent earth....
""I believe in the Prince of Peace. I believe that war is murger. I believe that armies and navies are at bottom the tinsel and braggadocio of oppression and wrong; and I believe that the wicked conquest of weaker and darker nations by nations white and stronger but foreshadows the death of that strength.
""I believe in liberty for all men: the space to stretch their aims and their souls. The right to breathe and the right to vote, to choose their friends, enjoy the sunshine... uncursed by color; thinking, dreaming, working as they will in a kingdom of God and love.""

The Center also studies across-sectional samples of the national white population in the fall of 1964, 1968, and 1970. The results of these studies was published in a monograph, White Attitudes toward Black People, issued in 1971.
It's author, Angus Campbell discovered that there is no unified, ""white"" view of race relations in America, no single typical, representative, racial attitude.
Instead, white Americans generally agreed that laws ought to prohibit discrimination on the job, the urban disorder required more than a swift, police response, and that the white community should never take the law in its hands to enforce order in times of racial disturbance.
Only on the question of housing integration did Campbell find division among his white respondents.
The scholar's conclusions were that white Americans had largely abandoned their previously held contention — taught from pulpit and classroom and accepted as Holy Writ by most of white America — that Blacks were inherently incapable of competing equally with whites. Instead, that discarded master race notion has been replaced with the assumption that low achievement levels in Black education and employment are due to a failure of will in Black America, and unwillingness to run
2
the race other, now successful Americans have run and won.
Campbell summed up the American racial picture today with the following truths:

White Americans are all racist in some degree;
resistance to change by the majority is the standard pattern in American race relations, although integration of the work situation is less likely to be resisted than integration of more private and personal areas of life;
social characteristics in the white population not associated with reational or ethic divisions — age, sex, income, occupation — have little relationship to racial attitudes. Only college education as a variable, according to Campbell, has any relationship to benign or malignant racial attitudes among whites.
white explanations for Black conditions have changed from ""the generic to the motivational"", a retreat from white superiority and a gradual movement toward blaming Black America for failing to measure up to standards set for it by the majority.

The other more public statement on American race relations was issued by what was called the Kerner Commission. On July 27, 1967, this presidentially appointed commission declared that ""white racism"" was responsible for America's continuing dilemma, and that the country has headed toward two separate societies, one Black, one white.
(It is difficult to determine how a people can go somewhere they've already been).
3
[The following underlining is in blue pen, added to the typed page. See images.]
I dwell at length at these summaries of white opinion and attitudes because they limit every discussion of the possibilities of racial progress. Like ants in an invisible bottle, Black Americans are held back by glass walls they cannot see, but feel as strongly as if they were made of steel.
In 1935, W.E.B. DuBois described the situation we face today. He said then:
""The colored people of America are coming to face the fact quite calmly that most white Americans do not like them, and are planning neihther for their survival, nor their definate future if it involves free, self-assertive manhood. This does not mean all Americans. A saving few are worried about the Negro problem; a still larger group are not ill-disposed, but they fear prevailing public opinion. The great mass of Americans are, however, merely representatives of average humanity. They muddle along with their own affairs and scarcely can be expected to take seriously the affairs of strangers or people whom they partly fear and partly despise. For many years it was the theory of most Negro leaders that this attitude was the insensibility of ignorance and inexperience, that white America did not know or realize the continuing plight of the Negro. Accordingly, for the last two decades, we have stiven by book and periodical, by speech and appeal, by various dramatic methods of agitation, to put the essential facts before the American people. Today there can be no doubt that most Americans know the facts; and yet they remain for the most part indifferent and unmoved.""*
4
After solid progress in every area of concern through much of the 1960's, one wonders how we have reverted to the racial status quo of today.
There are two reasons why we have slipped backward, two complimentary forces that have grown stronger over the last 10 several years. ,They are conservative politics and the economy of scarcity.
Two years ago we celebrated the end of the first two hundred years of the American experiment with Democracy, and the beginning of four years of great promise.
The rejection that year of eight years of Nixon and Ford seemed to suggest that the American electorate was ready for a radical change.
They were tired, they seemed to be saying, of callousness in the capitol, of carelessness with people's lives. They wanted a government as good as they thought they were, and elected as President a candidate who said he wanted the best.
About ten years ago, the noted sociologist Kenneth Clark tried to describe the ghetto where most Black people lived then as now. He said: ""...the ghetto is a social, political, educational, and — above all economic colony. Their inhabitants are a subject people, victims of the greed, cruelty, insensitivity and fear of their masters.
The Nixon-Ford years reinforced that definition; the Carter year-and-a-half has done little to change it.
Today's tragedy is not just that things remain the same, or worse, but that the removal, over the decade of the 1960's of the more blatant forms of American apartheid, haves made it too easy for too many people to be-
5
lieve them to have been radically altered for the better.
Nothing, in fact, could be further from the truth. All the old sayings are still true. We are still last hired, first fired. We are still last in, first out. We are still poor all of of proportion to our numbers, powerless despite our ability to elect Presidents, hungry regardless of integrated lunch counters, and ignorant in spite of integrated schools.
A quick look at the first seventy-eight years of the twentieth century is instructive. When the 20th century began, Black people were slaves in every way but legally. Most of us could not vote. Nearly every one who was educated at all, attended segregated schools, and in the South, for only a few months each year. Most could not hope to gain education beyond high school. Most worked as farmers or semi-skilled laborers. Few owned the land they farmed, or even their homes.
By 1970, much of this had changed, and changed for the better. Most of us had escaped the farm for the city. Most of us All are now able to vote, even if we choose not to do so. Most of our children now go to schools that are integrated by law, if segregated by fact. We have become doctors, lawyers, teachers, office holders---have spread across the entire spectrum of American employment.
[The following comment is handwritten in the left margin next to the following paragraph.] ? Update
Yet, even this progress is deceptive. In 1971, we were ten percent of the employed workers of America, but only one per cent of the engineers, only two per cent of the physicians, only three percent of the managers and administrators, and only six percent of the craftsmen. In contrast, we were seventeen percent of the service workers, twenty percent of the laborers, and fifty percent of the women who earn their living in other women's homes. And we have consistently constituted
6
twice as many of those who have had no job at all.
These statistics describe a people in permanent crisis, a crisis shown not just in figure and fact, but in the daily lives of millions, for whom life has hever been a crystal stair.
In the one hundred and fifteen years since Abraham Lincoln freed the slaves, the lives of Black Americans continue to be colored by race. Since Reconstruction, our fortunes have risen, only to fall again, much like the opposite ends of a sew-saw.
Just this weekend the Rand Corporation released a study which demonstrates that despite impressive gains, it will take 30 years before wage rates for Black American males equal those for whites. That suggests a malignancy in the nation, a cancer no surgeon can excise. It is the central fact of life for non-white Americans, eclipsing sex, geography, education — everything.
For the last century and a quarter, Black Americans have repeated the immigrants progress undergone earlier by Europeans. Just as in 1921 it was believed that Italians, Poles and Jews were feeble minded, and therefore subject to restrictive immigration laws, Black Americans were thought mentally suspect too. An inferior people may be treated sub-humanly at worse, and differently, at best, and Black Americans have always been treated both ways.
[The following comment is handwritten in the left margin next to the following paragraph.] ?
Now that the formal trappings of racism are eliminated, a growing number of Americans of color discover themselves left out. They may sit on the front of the bus but have no where to go. They may eat in any restaurant, but can't afford the meal.
7
Twice as many Black Americans are jobless now as in 1968, ten years ago. 100,000 Black men have lost jobs in the short period of the Carter presidency. We are 10% of the labor force, and 20% of the unemployed.
We are 27% of those who have been jobless for 15 weeks, 30% of those jobless for 27 weeks, and 34% of those who have had no job for a year.
Since the beginning of World War II, millions of Southern Blacks migrated to America's great cities. More than half of us live in central cities today. Attracted originally by the promise of jobs and freedom from the reign of Jim Crow.
Shortly after we arrived, however, the jobs departed, lured to suburbs by tax incentives and subsidies; in effect a real unemployment tax paid by — not to — the urban Black.
As these cities become home for the wealthy of one race and the poverty-stricken of another, the phenomenon Dr. Harvey Brenner calls the ""doom factor"" comes to bear.
In Brenner's scheme, an increase in unemployment also increases suicide rates, homicide rates, and incidences of state mental hospitalizations among males.
A rise of 1.4 percentage points in unemployment in 1971, Brenner says, was directly responsible for 51,570 deaths, including 1,740 homicides and 1,540 suicides, and 5,520 additional mental hospitalizations.
These depressing figures reflect and record the American unwillingness to pay the inconvenience costs of fulfilling the American Dream.
They demonstrate why our cities are in decay, our prisons overcrowded, our schools failing, and why more that 10% of our national population has been condemned to the status of a permanent underclass, doomed never to stand equal with their country women and men.
8
One must wonder, however, how things could bet better and worse at the same time, how a committment to total war on poverty could become a mere skirmish, and how the national mood which seemed to favor equality through most of the '60s could become so perverted and mean.
The social planners of the Johnson era could not have forseen that the Vietnam war would force them to choose between guns and butter, or that guns would win and butter become scarce. They could not have predicted that their cut-backs in social service would be seized upon a decade later as proof that the poverty war was unwinnable, and that ""throwing money after problems"" was no solution at all, although the little money thrown was scattered so widely it is a wonder it had any effect at all.
They could not have predicted the global phenomenon now upon us, the shrinking of natural resources relative to the world's population, the reversal of the economic and political dynamics of the world's political democracies, the beginning of the age of scarcity.
9
Richard Barnett, in a disturbing essay last month in the New York Times sunday magazine, discussed this new ""age of Scarcity,"" and the growth of what has been call the lifeboat ethic....a metaphor that suggests humanity as the passengers on a kind of global titanic, a sinking ship without enough lifeboats for everyone.
Naturally, those to be left out of the lifeboats constitutes that increasing portion of the world's population that is becoming irrelevant to the productive process...the chronically unemployed, predominantly people of color.
Barnett believe this is the heart of the global human rights problem. That, in an age of slowing growth brought on by shrinking resources, the cost of those resources is going up and the valued placed on human life is going down.
[Handwritten in right margin after the following paragraph.] ?
The lifeboat ethic, and its consequences, are becoming increasingly visible in the United States: in the decay of the Center Cities, where most of the poor are concentrated: In the depressed rural areas no longer needed to produce the nation's food: In the seven million Americans unemployed.
And it is visible in the striking similarities between Jimmy Carter' budget proposals and those of Gerald Ford and Richard Nixon. All three have tended to write off the desperate needs of poor people in the name of a new brand of economic realism. Carter's response to the plight of the cities is an urban plan that amounts to a band-aid for an ampu-
10
tation. The Humphrey Hawkins full employment bill has been so severely disembowlled by the white house that its passage into law will amount to little more than a legislative funeral.. The rememberance of good intentions.
The code words and slogans are: ""austerity,"" ""conservation,"" ""limits to growth,"" and ""limits to what government can do."" Whatever validity they may have. they signal to minority groups that there is no more room in the boat for us.
There are other signals and shifts in mood and attitude that express the lifeboat ethic even more ominously. Samuel Huntington, and advisor to the national security council, warns against the ""excesses"" of democracy, and suggests that the problems of government are too complex to accomodate the conflicts inherent in democratic rule.
Interest in repairing the ravages of racism and deprivation has faded away as Americans increasingly look out for number one. And the growing volume of complaints about the cost of welfare, medicaid, social security and other social programs, voices the fear that too many swimmers are hanging on the sides of the boat, pulling it under with them.
11
Many of the gains won on yesterday now seem suspect. The right to sit in the bus front seat loses meaning for a people whose longest trip is apt to be was from the feudal system of the rural South to the mechanized, high-rise poverty of the North. The right to vote loses meaning for people forced to choose between Tweedledum and Tweedledee. The right to an integrated education means little to children bussed from one ignorant academy to another.
The civil rights struggle of the 1960s were carried forward against rigid discrimination in housing, employment, education, and were successful because the victims soon became their own best champions and because they found a sympathetic ear in the national body politic. But, when the demands of the 1960s became more insistent, as a foreign war began to drain our treasury and young manhood, as our best and brightest were beaten down by bullets, a shift began to occur in the national consciousness.
The decade of the 1960's had seen the number of people
12
officially defined as poor, by government statistic, reduced by nearly one-third. But, beginning in 1968, the American poor became the unwilling victim of the illicit combination of the gratuitous gratification of the gross and the greedy, the national nullification of the needs of the needy, and the victory of the politics of penuriousness, prevarication, of pious platitudes and self-righteous swinishness.
[Handwritten in right margin after the following paragraph.] ?
Swiftly, the Nixon administration, these cruel and callous castrators, moved with cold calculation to freeze, kill, and cut back urban renewal, model cities, community action, public service employment, student loans, public housing, federal impact funds for education--and to impose a 60% national pull-back in social services.
If we are to believe with Thomas Jefferson that ""the common man is the most precious portion of the state,"" we find that precious resource in real danger of economic extinction today.
Until January 1976 the federal government offered nothing
13
but a series of national disasters for black people -- with no emergency relief in sight. Now the pattern is being set for what the next years may bring.
Even now, another blow against progress is being organized by the collection of some old friends and some old enemies, who have joined to mount a nationwide legal challenge in California, Washington State, Florida and Georgia to the affirmative action and equal opportunity programs that all-too-slowly and cautiously are providing compensation for 2300 years of a sexually and racially motivated quota system which has guaranteed that the male and the pale will hold a monopoly on good jobs, on college and university seats, on positions of power in government, and all the benefits and rewards American promises the many and delivers only to the few.
To admit Alan Bakee to medical school by order of the court would:

place a chilling burden on every equal opportunity plan in America, no matter how different from the one he objects to;
declare him the winner of retroactive lottery among more that 22,000 unsuccessful medical school applicants;
overturn the unanimous conclusions of 13 admission committees at 13 medical schools which rejected him;
hold suspect the degrees of whites granted admission at the school he sued, despite lower scores than his;
and certify the admission to medical schools of whites with low paper qualifications while denying such entery to similarly qualified minorities.

14
[Handwritten in right margin after the following paragraph.] ?
We need to develop an economy that provides a place for everyone, that removes the economic elitism that characterizes this century. The battle lines must shift to a new struggle: to winning the economic democracy that for so long has been denied most Americans, a deprivation that has relegated 1/3 rd? Blacks to the status of a permanent underclass, half subsisting below the poverty line, while the rest work twice as hard to earn half as much as everyone else.
Our goals ought to include: income and wealth redistribution through a tax structure that reduces the disparity between the needy and the greedy;
The beginning of the end of poverty through a program of real full employment, supplemented by a negative income tax for marginal wage earners;
15
A system of total, lifelong education that would dignify vocational as well as academic training, and permit each person to realize full potential;
Free, adequate, cradle-to-grave health care for all, financed through the national treasury, not by profit-making insurance companies;
Effective social control of monopoly, and national, regional, or municipal ownership of vital services, operated for the welfare of the citizens, not the profit of a few.
These hold the promise of no perfect world, but do hold out the hope that we may create a system of laws and relationships between us that promise more than the present system of privilege for only a few.
What we need to be about is the creation re-creation(?) of a national coalition of need conscience(?) , of parents who want care, not warehousing for their children, of workers who want work at a decent and protected wage, of all those who want an end to subsidy and socialism for the
16
rich and welfare and capitalism for the poor, all those who must learn that sufficiency for those at the bottom is compatible with stability for those in the middle, all these people now live in America, divided now by race and class, fearful of each other, unorganized and impotent.
We ought to be reminded of some words spoken by Dr. W.E.B. DuBois nearly half a century ago: ""We are American Negroes. It is beside the point to ask whether we form a real race.

A little less than a year ago day after tomorrow and a few days less year ago another set of murders occurred in Jackson, Mississippi. There are many like myself who will always believe that if those killed in Jackson had to die at all, they were lucky to die when they did, so that someone besides their classmates, their mothers and their teachers would know that they lived and died at all.
But that is all history now, and we, like good students, are predetermined to either learn from it, and move ahead, or doomed to repeat it again and again.
Repeating it means more than Guardsmen and dead bodies and blood-thirsty policemen on college campuses; it means that we will never get free from the trap that has been set for us, the trap that shows movement and agitation rising and ebbing and rising and now ebbing again.
In those terms, Kent State was a high-water mark. It signaled a new kind of rage on the campus, among many of the young who had chosen not to be enraged before. At Kent State in 1970, bullets ceased to discriminate, just as billy clubs stopped discriminating in Chicago in 1968.
But that rage was never translated into any kind of movement, de demonstrating that rage generated by instant death is perhaps not s

sufficient to sustain an orderly, disciplined attack on the oppression and wrong that you are here learning how to become a part of.
What will it take, then, to build and sustain a determined attempt to literally overthrow the grip held on all of the oppressed people living inside her these shores as well as those just now beginning their struggle around the globe . ?
What is immediately obvious is how it cannot be done. It cannot be done, for example, by engaging in adventurism of the sort that results in appealing rhetoric but also in increased repression for this country's non-white population. Revolution is seldom precipitated through the exercise of the vocal cords, and slander, however clever, will never substitute for scientific analysis.
Woodstockism cannot be tolerated while Watts exists; ROTC on the campus cannot compete for the attention of today's activist with rats in the ghetto. Debates about the relative revisionism of the late Ho Chi Minh are not allowable in a land with no revolutionary ideology of its own.
It is not simply that these things are unequal but that one has no place beside the other; it is foolish to ask a people whose daily preoccupation is with survival to appreciate the niceties of North Korea's position on the women question or whether the Army discriminates against homosexuals, or whether Tide pollutes more than Ivory Snow.
3
Survival, then, is precisely the question for all of America's under-class, and particularly so for black people. Every current statistic suggests that we are gradually sinking into a pathological state induced by our constant position on the bottom of the American heap, and every current study and analysis demonstrates that despite whatever minimal achievements we have struggled through over the last decade, our position in relation to everyone else is worsening.
We come to this point in 1971 through a peculiar history, made peculiar not just by color and condition and previous and present servitude, but through the availability of differing sets of alternatives.
It is proper to divide the black struggle of the last decades into two distinct periods. In an article in the current Harper's magazine, Bayard Rustin describes the periods eloquently. While there is some disagreement to be found with his suggestion of what must happen in the future, there can be found none with his analysis of what has happened in the past. Let me quote him at great length. He says:
"". . . The first phase, which covered something like the first half of the decade, was one in which the movement's clear objective was to destroy the legal foundations of racism in America. Thus the locale of the struggle was the South, the evil to be eliminated was Jim Crow, and the enemy, who had a special talent for arousing moral outrage among even the most reluctant sympathizers with the cause, was the rock-willed
4
[segregatopmost]
segregationist , the professional white Southerner.
""Now, one thing about the South more than any other has been obscured in the romantic vision of the region - of ancient evil, of defeat, of enduring rural charm - that has been so much of our literary and intellectual tradition; for the Negro, Southern life had precisely a quality of clarity, a clarity which while oppressive was also supportive. The Southern caste system and folk culture rested upon a clear, albeit unjust, set of legal and institutional relationships which prescribed roles for individuals and established a modicum of social order. The struggle that was finally mounted against that system was actually fed and strengthened by the social environment from which it emerged. No profound analysis, no overriding social theory was needed in order both to locate and understand the injustices that were to be combated. All that was demanded of one was sufficient courage to demonstrate against them. One looks back upon this period in the civil-rights movement with nostalgia.
During the second half of the Sixties, the center of the crisis shifted to the sprawling ghettos of the North. Here black experience was radically different from that of the South. The stability of institutional relationships was largely absent in Northern ghettos, especially among the poor. Over twenty years ago, the black sociologist E. Franklin Frazier was able to see the brutalizing effect of urbanization upon
5
lower-class blacks: '. . . the bonds of sympathy and community of interests that held their parents together in the rural environment have been unable to withstand the disintegrating forces in the city,' Southern blacks migrated north in search of work, seeking to become transformed from a peasantry into a working class. But instead of jobs they found only misery, and far from becoming a proletariat, they came to constitute a Lumpenproletariat, an underclass of rejected people. Frazier's prophetic words resound today with terrifying precision: '. . . as long as the bankrupt system of Southern agriculture exists, Negro families will continue to seek a living in the towns and cities of the country. They will crowd the slum areas of Southern cities or make their way to Northern cities, where their family life will become disrupted and their poverty will force them to depend upon charity.'
""Out of such conditions, social protest was to emerge in a form peculiar to the ghetto, a form which could never have taken root in the South except in such large cities as Atlanta or Houston. The evils in the North are not easy to understand and fight against, or at least not as easy as Jim Crow, and this has given the protest from the ghetto a special edge of frustration. There are few specific injustices, such as a segregated lunch counter, that offer both a clear object of protest and a good chance of victory. Indeed, the problem in the North is not one of social injustice so much as the results of institutional pathology. Each of the various institutions touching the lives of 
ur
6
urban blacks - those relating to education, health, employment, housing and crime - is in need of drastic reform. One might say that the Northern race problem has in good part become simply the problem of the American city - which is gradually becoming a reservation for the unwanted, most of whom are black. . . .""
[Rustin then sums up]
""If the problems of the ghetto do not lend themselves to simple analyses or solutions, then, this is because they cannot be solved without mounting a total attack on the inadequacies endemic to, and injustices embedded in, all of our institutions. . . .""
Rustin then sums up where we are and what we face by stating that ""The truth about the situation of the Negro today is that there are powerful forces, composed largely of the corporate elite and Southern conservatives, which will resist any change in the economic or racial structure of this country that might cut into their resources or challenge their status; and such is precisely what any program genuinely geared to improve this lot must do. Moreover, these forces today are not merely resisting change. With their representative Richard Nixon in the White House, they are engaged in an assault on the advances made during the past decade. It has been Nixon's tragic and irresponsible choice to play at the politics of race, not, to be sure, with the primitive demagoguery of a ""Pitchfork Ben"" Tillman, say, but nevertheless with the 
7
same intent of building a political majority on the basis of white hostility to blacks. So far he has been unsuccessful, but the potential for the emergence of such a reactionary majority does exist, especially if the turbulence and racial polarization which we have recently experienced persists.
""What is needed, therefore, is not only a program that would effect some fundamental change in the distribution of America's resources for those in the greatest need of them, but also a political majority that will support such a program. . . ."" 
Here we part company, but I think his analysis suggests a partial way to escape from the trap of politics always escalating into protest culminating in rebellion resulting in repression that we seem continually headed toward.
That is the construction of a political movement that can seize power in the standard, civics text-book fashion of electoral victory after electoral victory, while in parallel fashion it allows for the growing nationalist sentiment that the American black community is now pregnant with.
This pregnancy can be stillborn or aborted by having majority America reinforce the concentration camp and reservation psychosis that is slowly encircling our native-born colonial population, or it can give birth to the kind of ehtthnic diversity that we so falsely insist
8
our pluralistic society permits.
If politics depresses you, consider that when the Cuban people overthrew Batista, they underwneent political change; as the Vietnamese continue their centuries old struggle to be free of foreign domination, they are and have undergone political change.
You may long for their activism and militant and military manner, but you shou should remember what Che Guevera said it seems so many years ago: ""The streets of Harlem are not the mountains of the Sierra Maestre.""
It is particularly important that you involve yourself in political activism of the broadest sense. This is not simply election day doorbell ringing, or the Democrans or Republicrats but the more important task of building constituencies of common interest that can force change through their votes, through their measured feet marching in the streets, or through whatever form of mass action they - not you - choose to undertake.
It is important for you because it offers you a chance at what black people have been seeking for 352 years: a chance to have something to say about what is being done to you, all about you.
It is important because you can offer some life and hope for a people without hope who are close to spiritual and political death, and it is important because a year ago this month many of p you promised you would do something and then did nothing at all.
It is important finally, because most of you will do nothing anyway, no matter how many speeches are made or how many shots are
9
fired or bodies counted or babies starve to death, and it is important because since your mothers and fathers didn't do it, your children may not have a chance to do it.
George Wald, a Nobel Laureat in biology, summed it up in a speech he delivered two years ago. He said then:
""About two million years ago, man appeared. He has become the dominate species o the earth. All other living things, animal and plant, live by his sufferance. He is the custodian of life on earth, and in the solar system. It's a big responsibility.
""The thought that we're in competition with Russians or Chinese is all a mistake, and trivial. We are one species, with a world to win. There's livfe all over this universe, but the only life on this solar system is on earth, and in the whole universe, we are only [ne]  men. 
""Our business is with life, not death. Our challenge is to give what account we can of what becomes of life in the solar system, this corner of the universe that is our home; and most of all, what becomes of men - all men, of all nations, colors and creeds. This has become one world, a world for all men. It is only such a world that can now offer us life, and the chance to go on.""

That is a small number, to be sure, but it does mean that the number of Black people in the United States who practice the art of politics is increasing.
This art is not the art of the possible; that only means that for Black people, most things are impossible; this is not the art of compromise; that only means that Black people must compromise so much that nothing is left when we are through; this art is simply the process of seeing who gets how much of what from whom.
Although the practice of politics is a scorned one today in this country, among Black and white, rich and poor, it is increasingly a pleasure to be one.
That is a pleasure because of tradition - I belong to the world's
2
second oldest profession - and it is a pleasure because of what that word ought to mean to you.
If you are one of the 1800 politicians, in the sense I use the word, then a group of people, probably Black, got together and elected you. They chose you, out of a group of two or three or more people, because they believed you could do something for them.
I assume, incidentally that it was Black people who chose the 1800 because white people, generally speaking, haven't yet learned to separate the man from his race. That is to say while Black people are always having to choose between two white candidates for president, governor, mayor, alderman or sheriff, if given the choice between white and Black, the white bloc vote votes its race every time.
I assume also, that the people who chose the 1800 are like the people who chose me. They live in a city or a town; they live in what outsiders call a ghetto, but what we call a neighborhood; they haven't
3
got much book learning, but they are not stupid, they don't have good jobs, but they do work hard, they are cheated by neighborhood merchants, Black or white; they are abused and brutalized by policemen, Black and white; they live near prostitution, narcotics, gambling and petty crime from which they receive only marginal benefits, and of which they are the greatest victims.
If they are Southerners they may send their children to integrated schools; that is, schools where the Black man who was principal last year is assistant to the assistant principal this year, and where the school song is Dixie.
Some may be on welfare, which means they barely stay alive while Uncle Sam pays farmers not to farm, tells all millionaires they don't have to pay some of their taxes, and Congress barely defeats the new A.D.A. Program, or Aid to Dependent Airlines.
They may have a new governor, as voters in my state, in Arkansas
4
and South Carolina do, but they may be discovering that Inaugural Day rhetoric is merely a cover for a more sophisticated brand of racist populism like that pushed by the Hillbilly Hitler in Alabama.
Finally, and increasingly important to us as politicians, these constituents probably vote Democratic like their lives depended on it.
That last is important because next year we choose a president in this country, and these voters and mine will be called upon to have something to say about who he will be.
We are in the same position with the Democratic party as the man who was told only two airlines could take him where he wanted to go. One of the two had the best safety record, but the worst record for hiring Black people. He had to decide whether he wanted to be a race man or a live man.
That is why independence is important for us. It is not going to be possible for 15% of the population, disorganized and scattered,
5
to form a third party by 1972. It it possible to hold ourselves aloof and independent from the hustle and bustle that is sure to build up around the multiplicity of Democratic candidates in 1972, and to extract important promises from one of them, or to run our own man, a Black man, for that office in each of the Democratic primaries across the country.
This is important for us. I am sure you remember the foolish cries of 1968 that urged the election of Richard Nixon on the grounds that his victory would heighten the contradictions, make things worse, and thereby hasten the revolution.
This is the same kind of sidewalk masochism that elected Adolph Hitler in Germany, and usually comes from people who want our contradictions heightened, not their own.
The plain facts are that heightened political activity on our part is a must in the next year and a half.
We have got to beware those people who urge us to support candidate
6
A or B or C, and instead have got to act in our own interests for once.
This means defeating not just Richard Nixon - an easy job when the Gallup poll reports that only 28% of the population gives him a ""good to excellent"" rating on the job he is doing - but putting into public office all over the country men and women who care about us and our problems.
No one has to recite a long list of what these problems are. Everyone in the country who is their victim knows what ravages racism and domestic colonialism have wreaked upon us.
The answer to the problem is government, no matter what kind of system you live under, and the answer to governmental inactivity and indifference is massive agitation and organization.
The mass of the American population cares little about whether we rise or fall, live or die, and therefore the burden of escape falls on the victims of the crime.
7
I propose that we begin today, in this country's districts, towns and cities, the tremendous task of welding together a strong Black electorate that will be prepared to make independent decisions about who Black people vote for and against in the months and years ahead.
As you do this, there will be those, white and Black, who will accuse and abuse you.
These are the psuedo-militants who believe that natural hair can camouflage a processed mind.
These are the boutique radicals who would rather debate the relative revisionism of the late Ho Chi Minh or the presence of ROTC on the campus than do something about rats in the ghetto.
These are the limousine liberals who must have their manhood insulted before they will give a dollar to help feed the hungry.
These are the upright citizens who will tell you that politics is all corrupt and hopeless, but who give politicians hell when we don't
[Handwritten at bottom:] go to p. 9 — numbered wrong

[Handwritten at top:] (no page 8 — I goofed)
deliver the moon and stars.
These are the open-hearted-people-lovers who want you to sign a petition against discrimination in Iceland, but who don't worry about discrimination in their own offices and factories.
These are the people who will attend a Woodstock but still tolerate Watts, who believe that love will conquer all or that we can smoke America to her knees.
If, like in the movie, love means never having to say you're sorry, an awful lot of sorry people have made us live sorry lives for 352 years.
If smoke alone would do it, there should be an awful lot of problem free young people in America today.
But if we get together, we can make a difference.

philosophy of Congressman Bill Clay of St. Louis, and remember, in his words, that ""we have no permanent friends, no permanent enemies, only permanent interests"", then we can begin to build a Black-based political movement that can elect and defeat those who help or hinder us.
We are 45% of New Orleans, 58% of Memphis, 42% of Richmond and Birmingham, 44% of Savannah, nearly 50% of Augusta, 52% of Greenville, Mississippi.
We have got to develop an interest in what happens in these places and in hundreds of towns and counties like them.
What happens in Memphis or Newark or Alaska or Alabama to any of us is important to all of us.
Finally, there are some recent alarming signs for us all.
All on the same day, Thursday March 25:

the House Internal Security Committee voted to retain the concentration camp features of the Emergency Detention Act;
11

the Department of Health, Education and Welfare announced that while infant mortality rates for whites had fallen, for Black young people they went up;
Senator Ernest Hollins of South Carolina released studies demonstrating that one third of the children in rural slums and urban ghettoes suffer from retardation;
the Southern Regional Council in Atlanta said that the federal government's rosy figures on school desegregation were untrue.

Taken apart, these are merely small disruption in anyone's daily life.
Taken together, they are symptomatic of a pernicious national disorder that threatens each of our lives and well being.
These seemingly separate announcements ought to be a part of a continuous signal to us, a signal that what was wrong is still wrong and what needs to be right will never be right until we ourselves
12
determine that it will be.
It is of course important that all we politicians hold uppermost in our minds the fact that someone chose us. Someone chose us because they thought we'd make life easier. We try, most us as best we can, but something more than that is needed.
We are, for good or evil, or for better or worse, only 1800 in number. We are far from perfect beings, and as a class of people are just about as dishonest, crooked, and as calculating as American college students and their professors are.
The sum of the task for all of us, then, must be to fight the evil, racism and violence that suppresses us all. That racism and violence must be carefully defined. We know full well that violence does not limit itself to the bomb at night or the brick through the window or the muggers' knife.
13
And we know that crime and criminality are not limited to the kinds of petty thefts, crimes against property and crimes of passion that flourish in some communities, but that violence and unchecked criminal elements are running rampant throughout American life.
It is violent and criminal, we propose, to have Black children attend school for twelve years only to emerge with a sixth grade education.
It is violent and criminal, we propose, to have Black young men represent a disproportionate share of the inductees and casualties in Vietnam, making us first in war, last in peace, and seldom in the hearts of our countrymen, it is violent and criminal, we propose to call welfare recipients lazy and shiftless while 6,000 farmers are paid an average of $25,000 each to do nothing. It is violent and criminal, we propose. for a ghetto merchant to charge 150% interest on a television set or a refrigerator, and then wonder why his store is the first one destroyed when the holocaust comes.
14
It is violent and criminal, we propose, for some of America’s young people, the generation we were told was ""different"" from the rest, to show more interest in music, drugs, the romantic rhetoric of revolution and the ennobling sacrifice of self enforced poverty that in the very real problems of existence that afflict so many really poor people, Black and white, today. It is violent and criminal, we propose, to promote
It is violent and criminal, we propose, to promote self help and the virtues of the free enterprise system for a group of people living in an economy that practices socialism for the wealthy and capitalism for the poor, and where property has always been more important than people.
It is violent to live in a land where the general public spends more money on tobacco for itself than all governments - municipal, county, state and national - do on education, and where annually more money is privately spend on pet food than government spends on food
15
stamps for the poor.
It is racist, we propose, to suggest that Christopher Columbus ""discovered"" a country that was already here, inhabited by a thriving and civilized population; it is racist, we propose, to have imported a group of people here against their will and then impose a strange and alien religion on them; it is racist generally for one set of people to impose their cultural values on another.
Until you hear that Black people are

claiming the superiority of James Brown over Beethoven;
of the pyramids of Egypt over the empire state building;
of Swahili over French and German and Latin;
of Langston Hughes and Imamu Baraka over Shelley and Keats and Shakespeare;
of Jack Johnson, Muhammad Ali and Jackie Robinson over
16
	over Gene Tunney, Rocky Marciano and Brooks Robinson. Of Elijah Muhammad over the Pope, then don't accuse us of racism.

Of course, these things are all quite possibly true, but we don't insist that you accept that truth, nor do we control the instruments that make yesterday's lie today's fact, but we do implore you to accept the possibility that it exists.
As we get deeper into the '70s the rhetoric of the last twenty years of Black struggle must be transformed into new and more intense action. We cannot afford twenty more years of preaching that the hour is late: the hour is now. We can't afford the luxury of warning that this is the eleventh hour: it has been midnight since before Nixon took office. The old excuses for inaction have stopped being mere copouts: they have become the badges of cowardice.
Young Black men and women are desperately needed for struggles in welfare offices, in labor halls, in political wards and precincts, in poverty-ridden communities, in courtrooms and in the streets. They
17
They are not going to be needed in some titanic confrontation of a visionary future; the are needed now, today. Unless they act now, there may not be any later.
We cannot afford the kind of inaction which justifies its existence because the ""in'actors"" are ""getting ourselves together""; we cannot afford the luxury of deciding that this or that method of achieving social change is too conservative or too militant; we cannot afford to have someone suggest that politics, or street demonstrations, and/or group economic entrepreneurship or any single method is the only method we can employ to secure our freedom. We cannot afford the luxury of a Woodstock in a nation that still tolerates Watts; we cannot afford to mouth the admirable rhetoric of Malcolm X without also adopting his admirable self-discipline. We cannot afford to emulate the activity of some radical groups that began Black, but are swiftly moving from the
18
""grey"" to the ""gay"" or other groups in the sectarian left who insist their analysis is the only one or that only ""true believers' can participate in what surely must be a people's movement.
Perhaps we might be assured by the thought that the struggle for racial justice and economic equality is racial in root while its effects on us are largely economic and psychological, but that they have an ecological base.
A base that is anti-ecological in the sense that it rejects the proposition that picking up beer cans on the highway will ever be suitable alternative activity for people who ought to be bringing the polluters of our air, water and land to public justice in concert with the criminal polluters of our lives.
But the base of the problem is ecological in the very real sense that the men who manufacture garbage to dump in our rivers also manufacture bombs and Napalm to dump in the human sea of Vietnam; in the
19
sense that the same people who manufacture automobiles that are no good when they are eighteen months old are the same men who refuse to use their expertise and skill and capital to manufacture full employment for men.
It is ecological in the sense once stated by Norman Cousins, editor of the Saturday Review, who said:
""With all his gifts, man has been able to effect vast change, making his life different from that of those who have lived before. His capacity for invention and his sense of creative splendor have constructed great civilizations. But he has never been in command of his own work. He has never been in balance. The result is that today, for all of his brilliance, he has thrown himself all the way back to his primitive condition, in which his dominant problem on earth was coping with his environment.""
To us, this must suggest either accommodating ourselves to the circumstances in which we find ourselves, or
20
circumstances in which we find ourselves, or in bending them to suit our needs, rather than crushing us to suit the needs and entertainment
This requires realization that there has not ever been, and never will be any real Negro problem in America, but that there has been, internationally, the kind of problem spelled out by the late, great Dr. W.E.B. DuBois. He said:
""The problem of the 20th century is the problem of the color line. - The relation of the darker to the lighter races of men in Asia and Africa and the Islands of the Sea.""
This problem is at the root of every other one. Until it is conquered, we shall all of us suffer together.

Ladies & gentlemen, brothers & sisters, it is a pleasure to be here.
It is a pleasure to be here because I am a politician, and many of you are politicians.
[See the final page's first five paragraphs for the content marked as the speech's introduction.]
That is a pleasure because of tradition - we I belong to the world's ] 2 oldest second oldest profession - and it is a pleasure because of what that word ought to mean to you.
If you are a one of the 1800 politicians, in the sense I use the word, then a group of people, probably Black, got together and elected you. They chose you, out of a group of 2 or 3 or more people, because they believed you could do something for them.
I assume, incidentally, that it was Black people who chose you the 1800, because white people, generally speaking, haven't yet learned to separate the man from his race. That is to say that while Black people are always having to choose between two white candidates for president, governor, mayor, alderman or sheriff, if given the choice between white and black, the white bloc vote votes its race every time.
I assume also, that the people who chose you the 1800 are like the people who chose me. They live in a city or a town; they live in what outsiders call a ghetto, but what we call a neighborhood; they haven't ] 3 got much book learning, but they are not stupid, they don't have good jobs, but they do work hard, they are cheated by neighborhood merchants, black or white; they are abuse and brutalized by policemen, black and white; they live near prostitution, narcotics, gambling and petty crime from which they receive only marginal benefits and of which they are the greatest victims.
If they are SouthernersTthey may send their children to integrated schools; that is, schools where the black man who was principal last year is assistant to the assistant principal this year, and where the school song is Dixie.
Some may be on welfare, which means they barely stay alive while Uncle Sam pays farmers not to farm, tells oil millionaires they don't have to pay some of their taxes, and Congress barely defeats the new A.D.A.C. program, or Aid to Dependent Airlines. Companies.
They may have a new governor, as voters in my state, in Arkansas ] 4 and South Carolina do, but they
[Circled at the top of this page break:] X
may be discovering that Inaugural Day rhetorical rhetoric is merely a cover for a more sophisticate brand of racist populism like that pushed by the Hillbilly Hitler in Alabama.
Finally, and increasingly important to us as politicians, your these constituents probably vote Democratic like their lives depended on it.
insert 1
That last is important because next year we choose a president in this country, and these voters and mine will be called upon to have something to say about who he will be. 
insert #1
This is important for us. I am sure you remember the foolish cries of 1968 that urged the election of Richard Nixon on the grounds that his victory would heighten the contradictions, make things worse, and thereby hasten the revolution.
This is the kin same kind of sidewalk masochism that elected Adolph Hitler in Germany, and usually comes from people who want our contradictions heightened, not their own.
The plain facts are that heightened political activity on our part is a must in the next two years year and a half.

Our lives did depend on it then, and our future political behavior will affect our lives as well.
We are in the same position with the Democratic Party as the man who was told only one two airlines could take him to where he wanted to go. It was the airline with One of the two had the best safety record, but the worst record for hiring black people. He had to decide whether he wanted to be a race man or a live man.
That is why independence is important for us. It is not going to be possible for 15% of the population, disorganized and scattered, ] 5 to form a third party by 1972. It is possible, to hold ourselves aloof and independent from the hustle and bustle that is sure to build up around the multiplicity of Democratic candidates in 1972, and to extract important promises from one of them, or to run our own man a black man for that office in each of the Democratic primaries across the country.
insert # 2
We have got to beware those people who urge us to support candidate ] 6 A or B or C, and instead have got to act in our own interests for once.
[Typed inserted content ends at this page break, and handwritten speech continues.]
That means defeating not just Richard Nixon - an easy job when the Gallup poll reports that only 28% of the population gives him a ""good to excellent"" rating on the job he is doing - but putting into public office all over the country men and women who care about us and our problems.
No one has to recite a long list of what these problems are. Everyone in the country who is their victim knows what ravages racism and domestic colonialism have wreaked upon us.
The answer to the problem is government, no matter what kind of system you live under, and the answer to governmental inactivity and indifference is massive agitation and organization.
The mass of the American population cares little about whether we rise or fall, live or die, and therefore the burden of escape falls on the victims of the crime. ] 7
I propose that you we begin today, in your this country's districts, towns and cities, the tremendous task of welding together a strong Black electorate that will be prepared to make independent decisions about who Black people vote for and against in the months and years ahead.
As you do this, there will be those, white and black, who will accuse and abuse you.
These are the psuedo-militants who believe that natural hair can camoflauge a processed mind.
These are the boutique radicals who would rather debate the relative revisionism of the late Ho Chi Minh or the prescence of rotc ROTC on the campus than do something about rats in the ghetto.
These are the limosine liberals who must have their manhood insulted before they will give a dollar to help feed the hungry.
These are the upright citizens who will tell you that politics is all corrupt and hopeless, but who give you politicians hell when you we don't ] 8 deliver the moon and stars.
These are the open-hearted-people-lovers who want you to sign a petition against discrimination in Iceland, but who don't worry about discrimination in their own offices and factories.
These are the people who will attend a Woodstock but still tolerate Watts, who believe that love will conquer all or that we can smoke America to her knees.
If, like in the movie, love means never having to say you're sorry, an awful lot of sorry people have made us live sorry lives for 352 years.
If smoke alone would do it, there should be an awful lot of problem-free young people in America today.
But if we can get together, we can make a difference.
We are from 20 to 70 per cent of the voters in 173 of this country's 435 Congressional Districts. If we follow the excellent ] 10 philosophy of Cong. Bill Clay of St. Louis, and re- member, in his words, that ""we have no permanent friends, no permanent enemies, only permanent interests,"" then we can begin to build a black-based political movement that can elect and defeat those who help or hinder us.
We are 45% of New Orleans, 58% of Memphis, 42% of Richmond and Birmingham, 44% of Savannah, nearly 50% of Augusta, 52% of Greenville, Mississippi.
We have got to develop an interest in what happens in these places and in hundreds of towns and counties like them.
What happens in Memphis or Newark or Alaska or Alabama to any of us is important to all of us.
Finally, there are some recent alarming signs for us all.

Quite recently a study was done which reported that there are roughly 1800 black politicians - black elected officials - in the United States.
That is a small number, to be sure, but it does mean that the numbers of black people in the United States who practice the art of politics is increasing.
This art is not the art of the possible; that only means that for black people, most things are impossible; this is not the art of compromise; that only means that black people mus compromise so much that nothing is left when we are through; this art is simply the process of seeing who gets how much of what from whom.
Although the practice of politics is a scorned one today in this country, among black and white, rich and poor, it is increasingly a pleasure to be one.
That is a pleasure (continue from first line on yellow sheet to the end)

June 14, 1971
Mr. Bond:
Thank you so much for the use of your speech. It was greatly appreciated.
[Signature]
Mrs. Josephine S. Moore 
News Bureau, University of Oregon
[Date seal.]

[Date seal.] Jun 18 1971
[The following pages are handwritten.]
Members of the class of 1971
It is standard practice on occasions like this one for the graduation speaker to tell the eager graduates to hitch their wagon to a star or that the world is theirs or that their job is to make the world safe for democracy.
More realistically, your job is to make American democracy safe for all Americans and the rest of the world.
You leave these ivory towers and enter into the real world at an interesting time.
Overseas, your country is still trying to impose its will on several nations of brown people.
Here at home, your nation continues to starve the hungry, impoverish the poor, subsidize the wealthy, colonize non-white peoples, befoul the air and water, and to continue to to generally perpetuate the status quo.
As literate human beings, as young people today certified as educated and informed by the state, you know these things to be true.
Additionally, as members of the generation that - so we are told - is going to save the world, you are prepared and committed to do something about it.
2
The great question, of course, is what will you do? What will be done.
Black people in this country - the group furthest down the ladder we are told traditionally leads to success, fortune and security - have tried a variety of methods and techniques.
Over the 352 years since we were dragged, screaming and kicking to these shores, we have seen some small improvement in our lot in life.
For example, we are no longer legal slaves. We can go to school in places where we never went before, get jobs where we couldn't work before, eat in restaurants where we weren't admitted before, and [gone] vote where we couldn't vote before.
But we still remain a people on a see-saw; we go up in one direction while going down in another.
We are and always have been the last to be hired and the first to be fired; there are more of us with no jobs at all today than anytime before in the last 10 years.
Despite some small Southern advances, there are more black children going to all black schools North of the Mason-Dixon line now than there were in 1954, when public school segregation was declared illegal.
3
While the Saturday night custom of lynching a black man has largely dissapeared in the South, the all too frequent murders like that two weeks ago in Drew, Mississippi reminds us that saftey in the streets and law and order means safety for others and little law and less order in our lives.
A quick look at the kinds of facts and figures that measure how well or how poorly a group of people are doing demonstrates clearly that while better off than we used to be, in relative terms we are now in worse shape than ever.
Infant mortality rates, unemployment median family income, life expectancy all the measurable statistics suggest a worsening, not an improvement, of the black condition.
Existing on the margin is not news for us.
That was true nearly 100 years ago when the civil war ended and we thought we would have a chance at determining our own destiny.
It continues now at the end of a similar era of
4
[The following pages are typeset.]
hope and limited progress.
What is happening now happened once again in American history in the years after Reconstruction. The promises that black people would be included in the social and economic life of the nation, were repudiated. Instead of fulfilling the dream, then and now:
- The white crusaders for social justice and democracy became weary as black people could no longer be considered a purely Southern problem;
- The aspirations for and movement of blacks began to be curtailed by organized violence and barbarity and by a series of legal and political manuevers designed to make black men less little more than political and economic equals eunuchs.
- The hopes and beliefs of black people that racial equality and social justice could be achieved through litigation, legislation, negotiation, occasional direct action and strong alliances with
5
white liberal groups were supplanted by disillusionment, bitterness and open anger.
- The guilt and indignation of Northern supporters of the Southern drive for equality turned into an attitude of cautious and now open - racism when the Northern black man began to take seriously the claims of racial progress and began to look for visible signs in Northern cities1.
Those who directed the movement from lunch counters to bus stations to voting booths to electoral politics are no longer there.
Those Northerners whose concern and whose money helped finance that movement are no longer concerned or financial.
The government we once thought sympathetic to our goals is either no longer the government or and is certainly no longer sympathetic.
6
The nation which now spends thirty billion a year to interfere in the political future of fourteen million Vietnamese and less than one tenth that amount to insure a decent future for 27 million poor black and white Americans now tells us that if the war ends today, we will not have thirty billion for domestic affairs but only eight billion.
It has been Class vs. Class and Race vs. Race in this country from the 17th century to this one beginning of America until now.
It probably will continue to be that. What is discussable for today's purposes is not whether it will continue to be that. But how the question will be put in the future. What responses will those in like yourselves, coming to power make? Will the establishment absorb again, as it does so well, those who rail against it?
The question of race will be increasingly put to the establishment on violent terms. This will not be the heated mass
[The following pages are handwritten.]
That is your test in the years ahead.
Whether or not sporadic campus protest and campus rallies against unclear air will be translated into a lifetime of political action aimed at settling the white problem in America.
Political action for you ought not mean just voting booths and campaign rallies, but year-round movement aimed at building a new American noisy and agitated majority that creates the base for social change.
Now is a good time to begin. This country will hopefully choose a new president in 1972, and you can have a hand in who it will be.
Not just by voting - that may be the least of your immediate concerns. You have got to join the oppressed American underclass in organizing a political movement that will insist that liberal campaign rhetoric and progressive platform promises becomes the hard and fast reality of the years ahead.
You can do this by employing the humanism that surely must be a part of the education you have received.
You do it in conversation with your friends and neighbors, and you do it by becoming an organizing committee of one, an organizer who sees his fr role as husband, mother, worker, parent or student as part and parcel of bringing together people who demand change in and out of our system through human concern for your fellow man.
You must harness yourselves to the age old impulse in man to have something to say about what is being done to him and with him.
That is the impulse which helped Cuban peasants overthrow Batista; the impulse which is directing the quarter century old struggle of the Vietnamese to govern themselves; the impulse which will triumph in Angola and Mozambique; the impulse which will someday drive all the Afrikaners into the sea; the impulse which will unseat the occupant of Uncle Strom's Cabin in Washington, and the impulse which drives all men to set themselves free.
Your impulse can come from a statement written by America's greatest black scholar, the late great Dr W. E. B. DuBois almost 50 years ago.
Dr. DuBois wrote then:
""We believe that the vocation of man in a modern, civilized land includes not only the technique of his actual work, but actual intelligent comprehension of his elementary duties as a father, citizen, a maker of public opinion.... a conserver of the public health, an intelligent follower of moral customs, and one who can appreciate if not partake something of the higher spiritual life of the world.
""We do not pretend that this can be taught to each individual in school, but it can be put into his social environment, and the more that environment is curtailed, the more emphatic is the demand that.... man shall be trained and trained thoroughly in these matters of human development if he is to share the surrounding civilisation.""
Or indeed if there is to be any civilisation at all.

That we are a minimal part of America's economy is indisputable--there can be no celebration over that.
We have, however, made some minimal advances in the political system in America, advances which seem most remarkable when compared with where we were just ten short years ago.
2
Last year, for example, the Voter Education Project reported that in the Southern region alone:

478 Black candidates were elected to public office in 1975.
In Alabama, 17 Blacks were elected to City Councils, two Mayors were elected, and one School Board member won office.
In Arkansas, nine Blacks were elected to School Boards.
In Florida, 37 Blacks won office, including two Mayors and 35 City Council members.
In Georgia, one State Representative chosen in a special election, 34 City Council members, and three School Board members.
In Louisiana, 90 Blacks won office, including one incumbent re-elected to the State Senate, nine State House seats, 62 Police Jurors, eight Constables, nine Justices of the Peace, and one Parish School Board member.
In Mississippi, eighty-eight Blacks won office, including four State Representatives, two Circuit Clerks, one Chancery Clerk, two Tax Collectors, one County Attorney, four Coroners, four County Superintendents of Education,
3
	16 County Supervisors, 28 Constables, 19 Justices of the Peace, five County School Board members, and two Election Commissioners.
In North Carolina, 83 Blacks won office, including 77 City Council members and six Mayors.
In South Carolina, twenty Blacks won office, including 16 City Council members, two Mayors, and two members of County Councils.
In Tennessee, 17 City Council members were elected.
In Texas, forty-five Blacks won office, including four Mayors, three School Board members, and 38 City Council officials.
In Virginia, 21 Black County Supervisors were elected, the state's only Black State Senator and only Black State Representative were re-elected, and one County Attorney, two County Treasurers, one Sheriff and three City Council members won office.

I said that these advances were remarkable when compared with where we were ten years ago, and so they are--but when compared with where we were when America prepared to celebrate its centennial, they seem less impressive.
4
There were thirty Blacks in the Mississippi legislature in 1970; today there are only four; there were 26 Blacks in the Georgia House in that period; today there are only 20; thirteen Blacks in the South Carolina legislature today is a great improvement over none in 1969, but during Reconstruction, we held 84 seats in the legislature there, not to mention the position of Lieutenant Governor, Secretary of State, State Treasurer, Associate Justice of the Supreme Court, and off and on, eight members of Congress. In a way, we are only struggling now to catch up with our political past. In short, Blacks in public office represent less than one percent of the more than 500,000 elected officials in the United States.
The demographic profile of Black Americans demonstrates where we are and where our political power can come from--from big cities and the non-urban South. Our profile also hints at our power-less-ness--the social indices most affiliated with Black people--low income, poor education, un- and under-employment--make for low levels of political participation.
What is frightening to consider--in March of 1976--is that once again the nation is choosing a President, and we are less prepared than ever to participate in that choice.
5
The facts are real ones. While Black people in the Southern region have an admirable record of political performance, nationally we are in real danger of counting ourselves out of helping choose who will govern us over the next four years.
In 1960, in a close election between John F. Kennedy and Richard Nixon, 39 million eligible Americans failed to vote.
In 1964, when Lyndon Johnson defeated Barry Goldwater in a landslide election, 43 million Americans chose not to choose.
In 1968, the figure rose to 47 million, and in 1972, 63 million Americans stayed at home and let the rest of us choose between Richard Nixon and George McGovern.
More frightening for us in 1972 is this--fewer than one-half of the 14 million Blacks who could have voted in that election were even registered to vote.
For many of us, it is a point of pride to recall that no Black person--except the security guard who discovered the break-in--was involved at all in the entire scandal that grew to be called the Watergate affair.
For some of us, this was an indication that the Nixon administration was so racist that they didn't even want to
6
grant us equality in crime; for myself, I sadly know too many brothers who would have cut John Dean's throat if they could have taken his place at Nixon's right hand.
The point here is that Black Americans had it in our power years earlier to have prevented the entire scandal, to have erased this sorry episode from history.
In 1968, had we voted an additional 10 more Black voters per Black precinct across the United States:

Richard Nixon would not have been elected President of the United States;
Berger, Blackmon, Powell and Rhenguist would not now be on the United States Supreme Court;
Spiro Agnew might still be the Governor of Maryland;
John Mitchell would never have been Attorney General;
John Dean and Charles Colson would be practicing law in obscurity;
the world would never know--or care--who Martha Mitchell is,
and Gerald Ford would not now be President of the United States.

Without attempting to shoulder all of the blame for the last eight years of reactionary rule, we must share some of
7
the responsibility, for in spite of restrictive law and social custom, in spite of shifts to the right among other sectors of the old Roosevelt coalition we belonged to, it is an undeniable fact--Black non-voters opened wide the door for the Nixon years in 1968, as surely as if we had carried him into office on our backs. It feels like we did.
Four years later, with less chance for success, our behavior was the same, and worse.
Now, despite a generally good record among Southern Blacks, the Voter Education Project estimates that a 12 to 15% point gap exists between Black and white voter registration in the eleven Southern states.
Nationally, the figure is worse. Proportionately, there are now more Black people registered to vote in Selma, Alabama, than there are in Brooklyn, or Chicao, or Detroit, or Philadelphia.
In 1976, regardless of which candidates ultimately come before us in November, the patterns of the poor participation in the past are likely to be repeated.
It provides little profit to discuss today why this is true if the discussion is limited to criticisms of the choices we may have then.
8
The point is that having little to do with the selection of the runners-up, we will be in poor position to blame the winners.
Critiques of the American political and economic system exist in great abundance, and need not be repeated here; to debate whether or not we ought to be in the ""system"" is like telling a drowning man he shouldn't be in the water; he is and so are we. We had better learn how to swim or build boats, and the water is rising every day.
The debate about whether or not we ought to participate in a the Bicentennial celebration is an artificial one; this country wouldn't have made it the first 200 years without our toil and talent, and it cannot continue for another 200 days if it ignores the resource we have to offer.
We do the country--and importantly ourselves--a great disservice when we voluntarily stand back from the great decisions being made around us.
We have just seen a primary won in Florida by a candidate who got 70% of our votes, and fifty percent of the votes of those who don't like us.
That effect is caused by a paucity of choices and the desire to defeat George Wallace, as well as the frightening
9
fact that we are--in spite of our failure to become absorbed into the American dream--more reflective of all Americans than we care to think.
Despite the traditional allegiance of Black voters to the Democratic party, there is a marked decline among all voters--and among us--in correlations between class and party affiliation. The 100% increase in the Black vote total received by Richard Nixon in 1972 over his 1968 total is indicative of this fact.
Although economic hard times have hit more of us harder than anyone else, this data suggest that Black voters will not fit as neatly into any party's column in the future, whatever the odds.
The American political process remains a series of diminishing options, regardless of who the candidates happen to be.
None of us can ever be completely satisfied with the quadrennial choice made the second Tuesday in November, no matter how noble, or committed, or even how ""Black"" one of the candidates may be.
The expectation that our preferred choice may win, or will have any more effect than the power to defeat the next
10
best candidate is slim, primarily because we have yet to build a national confederation of interest among ourselves that can be put into alliance with others who share our concerns.
What we need to be about in 1976--and for many, many years to come--is a version of politics which cannot be labeled by any of the old terms. To call our aspirations part of the ""new"" politics, or to label it ""radical"" or ""socialist"" is to merely put a title on a phenomenon still undergoing birth.
If there is an opening for an American era of politics different from the past, then it must be citizen's democracy, insurgent, but with its focus seriously aimed at power.
When I speak here of ""democratic"" and democracy"", I do not mean the political party presently out of power, or the system of selecting government leaders as presently practiced in America; I mean the system of equally distributing wealth and power in an organized society, through institutions based on the premise that we all have equal ability--and equal right--to make decisions about our lives and our future.
This will require the creation of a large cadre with the strategy, skill and vision to build a democratic movement in
11
the mainstream--a reassertion of the plain truth that ordinary men and women have the common sense to control their lives, given the knowledge and the means.
The instruments involved in building such a movement are more than electoral races, as important as they can be. The lesson we ought to have learned from the sixties is this--mass movement must have an organizational base; without organizations that are stable, continuous, and mass based, the movements that do emerge eventually flounder and decay; the sixties--in retrospect--were merely a series of mass mobilizations, winning impressive victories and inspiring great expectations, but ultimately unable to sustain a living democracy at the base of the society.
We must develop a political program broad enough to attract a large section of the population, real enough to have some expectation of implementation, and human enough to solve the problems which we have in abundance but which most Americans have in some measure.
As a beginning, let us agree on what we want:

to guarantee all Americans an equal opportunity to participate in the organization of this society, and in the shaping of public and private decisions which
12
	affect their lives;
to guarantee that none of us goes without the basic necessities--food, shelter, health care, a healthy environment, personal safety, and an adequate income;
to insure adequate national security against real threats from abroad, and 
to meet our obligations to assist in the development of the world's lesser developed nations.

To meet these goals, we must move radically away from an economy where the top 1% of the population receives more income than the bottom 20% and the richest 10% of the population receives the same income as the bottom 50%.
That is a monumental task--its conclusion, after two hundred years of struggle, is far from just around the corner.
Let us reflect then on some words from the past, the great scholar W. E. B. DuBois:
""We are American Negroes. It is beside the point to ask whether we form a real race. Biologically we are mingled of all conceivable elements, but race is psychology, not biology, and psychologically we are a unified race with one history, one red memory, one revolt. It is not ours to argue whether we will be segregated or whether we ought to be a caste. We
13
are segregated; we are a caste. Our problem is: How far and in what way can we consciously and scientifically guide our future so as to insure our physical survival, our spiritual freedom and our social growth? Either we do this or we die. There is no alternative. If America proposed the murder of our group, its moral descent into imbecility and crime and its utter loss of manhood, self-assertion and courage, the sooner we realize this the better. By that great line of McKay, 'If we must die, let it not be like hogs.' But the alternative of not dying like hogs is not that of dying or killing like snarling dogs. It is rather conquering the world by thought and brain and plan; by expression and organized cultural ideals. Therefore, let us not beat futile wings in impotent frenzy; but carefully plan and guide our segregated life, organize in industry and politics to protect it and expand it. What will be, no one knows. It may be a great physical segregation of the world along the color line; it may be an economic rebirth which insures spiritual and group integrity and physical diversity. It may be utter annihilation of class and race and color barriers in one ultimate mankind, differentiated by talent, susceptibility and gift--but any of these ends are matters of long centuries and not years. We
14
live in years, swift, flying, transient years. We hold the possible future in our hands, but not by wish and will, only by thought, plan and organization.""*

The tragedy of American foreign policy as observed in Angola over the last few months is that it reveals that we have no coherent African policy at all.
If a nation's foreign policy flows from domestic streams, then it is obvious that the roots of subversion, and of alliance with the South African government, have their base in two centuries of repression and racism here. It is then no accident in America's bicentennial year, that South Africa is an ally and Martin Luther King revealed to have been an enemy.
Now that the Popular Movement has triumphed, and now that recognition is being extended to it as the legitimate government of Angola, for Americans the question remains - what ought our relationship be to Angola, particularly, and the to Black Africa, specifically . ?
A quick look at the recent past is instructive here.
Using the simplistic rhetoric of the Cold War, the Adminsitration has attempted to justify its covert activity in Angola and its shameful alliance with South Africa as a holy crusade against international communism.
Typically, former United Nations Ambassador Daniel Mognihan characterized the Soviet involvement in Angola as a first step in colonising the entire continent. Secretary Kissinger points the accusing finger at the Soviet Union and Cuba for their support of the two defeat p Popular Movement, and rpso ipso facto, their involvement becomes justification for our own.
Obviously, the role played by the super-powers has been radically different, with the United States locked arm in arm as a supporter of the Salazar regime in Portugal during the precise decade and a half when Soviet involvement in Angola Africa was directed principally at supplying the forces attempting to overthrow the colonial government bolstered by our arms.and friendship.
2
The Ford administration then was faced with a decision.
The secret involvement of the Central Intelligence Agency by far predates the recent Angolan war, and gave President Ford the opportunity not to initiate CIA covert activity in Africa, but the option of whether or not existing activity ought to be maintained or increased.
The CU CIA had been supporting the FNLA and Holden Roberto since 1962, and had funneled monies into Zaire since 1960.
During the Kennedy and Johnson administrations, American policy toward Portugal's colonies was to play all ends against the middle, the provide to continue providing Portugal with military and political support while publically mouthing our support for nonviolent change and therefore nonexistent in the colonies. Our secret support went to all three of the groups opposing Portugese rule, but never in amounts sufficient enough to make any appreciable difference.
in 1969, the Nixon administration decided to end what was euphemastically called ""program aid"" as part of a larger scheme to improve our relations with the settler states in Southern Africa.
The Ford decision to ratify the suggestion made by the ""40 Committee"" was a departure from the earlier stance of minimal support to independence movement and major support to their enemies; it marked a conscious decision to attempt tp keep the MPLA from ruling Angola.
Following that decision last year, our policies have been two fold, to have Secretary Kissinger publically decry Soviet and Cuban intervention f on the one hand, and on the other, to secretly intervene ourselves with millions of dollars of covert aid to FNLA and UNITA.
That this policy set in motion, we became allies with the South African government's invasion of Angola.
The whole sorry story is a result of the Nixon Doctrine, outlined by the former President in 1970. The promise made then was that the United States would continue to define and police an international order in all regions
3
of the world.
The Vietnam war provided an amendment to that doctrine, suggesting that Americans would never again tolerate lengthy intervention at a cost of American lives. It would nbe necessary, in the words of as former Ambassador Ellsworth Bunker said about Vietnamization, to ""change the color of the corpses."" We accomplished this goal in Angola.
Aside from the specifics of the Angolan case, this doctrine means that we may will once again interfere in another civil war, having learned northing in years past.
For Americans, the questions are these:
Are we prepared now to rewrite rethink the assumptions of the past, to formulate new notions and policies in our dealings with Africa.
In Angola specifically, are we prepared to recognize the new government now, or must we wait as we did in Guinea Bissau until every other nation on earth has done so?
Will we continue to wallow in illicit relationships with South Africa, and help them continue to defy the United Nations mandate in Namibia? Must we always align ourselves with the wrong cause, on the wrong side, because the notion of anti-communism wipes away the sins of racism, facisms and totalitarianism?
Or can the Angolan experience, following as it does on the heels of defeat in Vietnam, become a lesson for us all . ?
While hoping for a political settlement among the disputing groups, we must insist on an end to all outside involvement in Angola; our own, the Cubans and the South Africans.
Will we commit ourselves - as we have done in Vietnam - to massive economic and rehabilitation assistance to the new government, or will we are we doomed to repeat the mistakes of the past over and over again.
A new African policy can be snatched from the bloodshed in Angola, but only if we are prepared to cast out the policies and policymakers twice discredited in this decade. 
[Handwritten pages begin here.]
American foreign policy is dictated by what we perceive to be our national interest - we determine our relationships with other nations based on their willingness to oppose our enemies.
As a consequence, we make common cause with nation's whose devo lack of devotion to Democracy would cause a blush from Atilla the Hun. Additionally because the conduct of all public policy in and by America is tainted by a national world view that sees us divided the globe divided into two main camps - the Free World, with America as the standard bearer, and the Communist states, marching in lock step to a tune played by the Soviet Union. Finally, Africans are Africans, and disposable.
This view has diminished a great deal over the last two decades, but is still quite dear to the Department of State.
An African policy - not a new policy, since none exists now, would include

deeds to bolster our fine words favoring majority rule
application of American standards of equal employment to American businesses licensed to operate in Africa
a non-intervention pledge in other nation's affairs
an African Marshall plan to eradicate hunger and poverty

These are generalities, and are probably agreed to by all of us here.
Again, the central question for Americans, white and black, is both a question of principles more specific than these I have mentioned, as well as a more general questio series of questions
- is there an American interest there?
there is.
- have we got a clearly defined relationship with the 40-plus countries that honors their sovernity, respects their differences, and makes uses our vast wealth and expertise to improve the life chances of their citizens
- we do not
- have we got a government - one in a long series - that rules by popular poll and yesterday's interest rather than stated principles born in our own armed struggle.
- we do
When
No other evidence of bankruptcy in foreign policy can be seen than choices which are made - not too early, but too late, and which are made by a government whose head speaks of replacing Ambassador Monyhan with a similar figure who - and I quote - ""will call a spade a spade.""
That - if anything - is our policy now, and whether groups like those of us gathered here represent elites or not, is a fact of American life
The English brought tea to Africa - the Americans must do more than bring sympathy.

INTRODUCTION
Almost a year ago, the National Urban Coalition embarked upon a project that no other private organization had ever attempted. We decided to explore in some detail the reordering of national priorities that is so widely felt to be an imperative for America. We decided to do this for two main reasons: first, because we shared the conviction that a shift in priorities is needed; and second, because the National Urban Coalition encompasses, perhaps uniquely, many of the disparate and often competing elements of American leadership that must ultimately be drawn together if an altered agenda is ever to be achieved. If a consensus on national priorities could be reached within this microcosm, it was thought, then perhaps a real reordering would be possible in the larger world outside.
The past two years have witnessed a tremendous amount of talk about reordering national priorities, most of it vague and undisciplined. The message from all of that talk cannot be denied. It is time to take a careful look at what a reordering of priorities really means, for without precise analysis there is no chance at all of achieving one. But the idea is not new. Both the Johnson and Nixon Administrations have emphasized the need for explicit consideration of where we wish to go as a nation. Last On July 20th a year ago President Nixon’s Committee on National Goals called for “constructive public discussion of alternative goals, priorities, and policies, with all groups of people participating.” The fruits of such discussion, the committee said, ""we should be incorporated into policies aimed
2
at alleviating the problems or enhancing the opportunities."" Three years earlier, President Johnson’s Commission on Budget Concepts (whose chairman, David Kennedy, is now Secretary of the Treasury) recommended that a private organization attempt to project national needs over a five-year period, basing its revenue assumptions on a high-employment economy.
Both of these recommendations are consistent with the approach taken here. When the staff of the Coalition’s National Priorities Project first addressed this task, they decided to use the federal budget for their analytical framework in devising a five-year projection of program and dollar requirements to meet national needs. Unread as it may be, the federal budget is the single most important instrument for the setting of national priorities.
The budget’s importance cannot be overstated. Federal outlays will exceed $200 billion in this fiscal year. The choices made within it reflect our national values. In addition the budget helps to determine national economic policy.
But there are deficiencies in the way that the budget is shaped - - deficiencies which, in the absence of reform, reduce the prospects for achieving significant change in our arrangement of priorities. One of the flaws is that budget allocations are
3
too often determined through what might be called the let’s see-what-we-gave-them-last-year-and-give-them-a-little-more-this-year approach. This practice militates against new ideas and tends to preserve programs which may no longer serve their original purposes.
Another flaw is the lack of openness from beginning to end of the budget process. Secrecy reigns. There is little public participation. The annual federal budget is issued each January after months of internal debate and negotiation at every level of government. At no time along the path is the budget open to public scrutiny. It continues in Congress, where the substantive committees and the appropriations committees examine individual segments of the budget, usually behind closed doors. At no time does any one body in the Congress consciously and deliberately scrutinize the budget as a whole, with an eye toward setting overall priorities.
We suggest that the budget process be opened to broad public participation and that the executive and legislative branches of government create mechanisms through which the choices facing America can be consciously and regularly examined.
In using the federal budget as a framework, the National Priorities Project staff evolved a draft National Priorities paper. It took the form of an alternative budget covering the fiscal years 1972 through 1976. It circulated widely. The staff convened meeting after meeting to review and revise it.
4
They discussed it at length with leaders representing business, labor, local government, Blacks, Mexican-Americans, American Indians, White ethnics, religion, education, youth, women, local Urban Coalitions, and social-welfare organizations.
The statement which follows--developed from that draft paper--has the general support of the members of the National Urban Coalition’s Executive Committee. Like other Americans, each of us has his own ideas of what is right and what is wrong with the nation’s current set of priorities. On a subject as complex as this, not all members will agree with every statement made. The choices are difficult.
We do not pretend that we have solved the country’s problems or even designed a blueprint for doing so. But it is our hope that this modest beginning will generate discussion and debate throughout the country and lead to precise and disciplined thinking about what “more of this” and “less of that” really implies. That is what we have attempted to do in the program of action which follows.
* * * * * * * *
3
GOAL ONE: FULL EMPLOYMENT
The budget should direct the nation back to full employment and a healthy rate of growth and economic activity. The immediate goal should be to reduce employment from its present level of approximately six percent. Ultimately, the rate of unemployment should be reduced steadily and carefully until work opportunities exist for all who desire them. A real growth rate exceeding four percent annually will be needed to accomplish this.
With the economy once again operating at full capacity, resources will become available to meet crucial public needs that are not now being met. A strongly growing economy will automatically produce a fiscal dividend in the form of greater revenues, which, in turn, will enable the federal government to provide a reasonable level of performance in essential programs and services that are now pinched for funds. The additional state and local revenues generated by such an economy will help save some of our cities and states from the bankruptcy they are fast approaching. Moreover, the single most effective program to eliminate poverty is an economy growing fast enough to provide jobs for the unemployed and for new recruits to the work force.
Full employment should be accomplished through stimulative fiscal policy directed by the Administration and supported by the Congress. This should be accompanied by a monetary policy that will assure sufficient liquidity to support the expansion.
4
To control inflation, the Administration should take effective action to prevent excessive price and wage increases and to remove employment barriers that are both inflationary and unfair.
GOAL TWO: EQUAL OPPORTUNITY
We believe that the sine qua non of full participation in American life is the opportunity for quality education. For many Americans, our educational system falls far short of providing that opportunity.
A part of the reason for this is that education begins--or fails to begin--before children reach school age. Research studies have concluded that about 50 percent of one’s intellectual development occurs between birth and the age of five and that such development is heavily influenced by environment. More recently, television’s “Sesame Street” has impressively demonstrated the degree to which pre-school children can learn when new knowledge is imaginatively and entertainingly presented.
For these and other reasons, the need for new programs in pre-school education is clear. But since state and local governments lack the funds for such programs, the federal government must provide subsidies in this area so that the opportunity for pre-school education will be available to all children.
At the elementary and secondary education levels, we believe that the federal government should be more zealous in seeing to it that the results of federally funded education programs reflect a minimum standard of performance. For example, Title I “compensatory education” programs should be focused on reading and
5
mathematics because Americans who cannot read and calculate live perpetually on the margin of society. So it is also with those who cannot speak English. Bilingual education should also be expanded and improved.
As for higher education, the federal government must expand the availability of financial aid for students so that no American is denied the opportunity to continue his studies because of insufficient funds.
Other aspects of equal opportunity do not require legislation. They require enforcement. Although the last decade produced progressive laws against discrimination in public facilities, employment, housing, and voting, the achievement was too largely a legislative triumph. The triumph will be empty so long as we lack effective implementation of those landmark laws. To be sure, enforcement agencies need more funds and more staff. But these alone will not suffice. What is needed, above all, is a commitment to enforcement by the national leadership. Without it, these laws will lose much of their meaning.
Finally, if equal opportunity is to be fully achieved, citizens of all races, classes, and income groups must have the chance to help shape the governmental programs and services that affect them. Government, moreover, must be held accountable to the citizens it serves. Here, too, it is a matter of will.
GOAL THREE: THE BASIC NECESSITIES
The United States has the richest, most productive economy in the world. But many Americans nonetheless lack the basic necessities for a tolerable life: food, shelter, health care, a healthy environment, personal safety, and an adequate income.
6
This need not be so. We can see to it that no Americans are deprived of these necessities.
It is almost goes without saying that the most vital of these is an adequate income. A reasonable income allows individuals to purchase most of the other basic necessities with dignity and free choice.
The majority of the income of most Americans comes from productive employment. As mentioned earlier, the federal government must shape its policies so that the economy will provide maximum opportunities for jobs at a living wage. We favor the following measures to accomplish this:

The use of fiscal and monetary policy to achieve sustained economic growth and high employment. Although effective action should be taken to keep wage and price increases within reasonable limits, we may have to be prepared to accept a somewhat higher degree of inflation than we have been willing to accept in the past.
Increase the minimum wage to an adequate level, and broaden the law to include coverage of more workers.
Creation of a program for public-service employment that would generate jobs at all levels of government as well as in non profit public-service organizations. These jobs would fill a clear need that cannot now be met because of insufficient revenues. Among them would be such positions as health aide, police aid, pre-school teacher, and pollution-control worker. All of these jobs should have the opportunity for career advancement built in. The federal government should provide subsidies to cover training costs, as well as a large portion of the workers’ salaries. One million of these jobs should be created by 1976.

7
For some Americans, wages and jobs will not suffice. Employment income must be supplemented by broader and better social insurance. Both Social Security and Unemployment Compensation should be changed to provide greater benefits and wider coverage. Unemployment Compensation should become a federally administered program, like Social Security, with uniform standards. The present public-assistance program, acknowledged to be a failure by virtually every element of American society, should give way to the new initiative for a cash assistance program.
To be more specific:
The federal government should scrap the present Aid to Families with Dependent Children (AFDC) welfare program. In its place it should establish a program, which, by 1976, would assure every household an adequate income, whether or not the head of the household is employed. The amount of the allowance would vary according to the number of people in the household. Work incentives would be built into the program; families would be allowed to keep a significant share of each dollar earned. Equally important, the program should be financed and administered entirely by the federal government. This would serve two purposes: it would relieve the financial pressure on the states, and it would assure greater equity for the recipients.
Assuring an adequate income would equip all households with the ability to meet the expenses of food, clothing, and transportation. It would not necessarily be enough to enable them to purchase adequate
8
health care and housing--two categories which require further discussion.
Many Americans now lack decent health care because of these major deficiencies:

Inadequate supply and poor distribution of medical manpower and health facilities, with inner-city and rural areas particularly short-changed.
An incentive system that tends to produce a far greater emphasis on high-cost curative care administered in expensive settings (hospitals) than on low-cost preventive care.

As a consequence of these two deficiencies, the cost of health care is very high for all elements of the population. To those in the low and lower-middle income groups, it is often prohibitive.
We feel that any workable remedy must be composed of two essential parts. The federal government must institute a National Health Insurance program -- paid for partly out of new taxes -- to assure every American that there at least is no economic barrier to adequate health care. And to make sure that adequate care is really available, it must increase the supply of medical manpower -- especially nurses and manpower-training grants. At the same time, the distribution of health facilities should be widened through a significant expansion of community health centers -- staffed in part by members of a Domestic Health Service Corps. As in
9
other fields, community residents should be given a major voice in determining the nature of local health programs.
Housing is similarly flawed. Like health, it suffers from inadequate supply. Thus, even an “adequate” income is no guarantee that a family will be able to find decent shelter at a reasonable price.
In 1968, the Congress set a 10 year national goal of 26 million new and rehabilitated dwelling units--enough to bring substantial assistance to families now living in sub-standard housing. Six million of these are to be low-and-moderate income units, subsidized by the federal government. After two years, we have hardly begun. Public and private housing starts in 1969 and 1970 fell 650,000 units short of the original 3,675,000 unit goal for those years, as high interest rates pulled money out of the mortgage market. Housing available to low-and-moderate income families ultimately depends upon the condition of the economy. Thus, if private housing starts continue to lag, more federally subsidized units will be the only way to assure all Americans of adequate shelter.
In 1949, Congress and the President declared the goal of a decent home and a suitable living environment for every American. If that goal is to be met, the federal government must:

Assure that substantially increased funds will be channeled into the mortgage market, thereby increasing the total supply of housing.
Appropriate enough funds with sufficient “lead time” to finance effectively the federally subsidized portion of the 10 year goal, as well as additional units if private starts continue

10
to fall short.

Reshape the federal housing programs to meet the social needs of their beneficiaries. This involves increased tenant serv[illegible] greater provisions for home ownership, preservation of functioning neighborhoods, and assurance that federally subsidized housing will be of high quality.
Broaden the eligibility criteria for participation in federally subsidized programs. Currently the most needy families are not eligible. Neither do families with incomes just above the poverty lines qualify for all these programs, even though housing on the private market is unavailable to them at reasonable cost. At the same time we should ensure that families residing in federally subsidized rental housing represent a wider spectrum of income classes.
Simplify (and reduce the number of) housing regulations now strangling federal housing programs.

Another requirement for national and individual well-being is adequate personal safety. Large numbers of Americans at all income levels do not now feel safe. The number of serious crimes reported has increased 148 per cent since 1960. Most of the increase has threatened city dwellers -- particularly residents of low-income areas.
Illusory demands for “law and order” have no provided solutions. What we need, instead, is reconstruction of our system of criminal justice -- action that will reduce crime without jeopardizing civil liberties. The most effective way to reduce crime is to treat its social, psychological, and economic causes; indeed, many of the programs and approaches discussed elsewhere in this statement will help
11
to accomplish that. In addition, however, the federal government should take the following action in the field of law enforcement and criminal justice:

Improve the woefully underfunded corrections system. The percentage of “repeaters” is remarkably high; if substantial numbers of offenders were rehabilitated, the crime rate could be cut significantly. Facilities for rehabilitation of drug addicts and alcoholics convicted of crime should be vastly increased. So should research into better methods of treating these problems. The social costs of our past failure to provide such remedial programs is immense.
Provide funds for modernization of the court system at all levels.
Expand federal aid to local police, but require that the emphasis be on police recruitment, training, research, and salaries, rather than on equipment.
Undertake a concerted effort to diminish organized crime -- particularly the dealers in hard drugs.

GOAL FOUR: RECTIFY THE REVENUE IMBALANCE
State and local governments face a steadily worsening financial crisis. Their revenues are falling farther and farther behind their expenditures, and an increase in state and local tax rates is usually political suicide. By 1976, the gap between expenditures and revenues at the local and state level is expected to be in the area of $60 billion.
12
The federal government must respond to this crisis. A revenue-sharing program alone is unlikely to close the gap, since the program most widely discussed would provide states and localities with only $5 billion per year by 1976. The most important single contribution the federal government can make is to ensure a growing economy that will automatically enhance state and local tax revenues. (Economic growth alone accounted for more than 55 per cent of increased state revenue between 1966 and 1968.)
In addition, the federal government should assume the state and local costs of certain functions which have to do with national problems. We have already recommended a cash-assistance scheme and national health insurance, which would replace the current public-assistance and Medicaid programs respectively. When our recommended proposals become fully effective, the cost now imposed by these latter programs--$5.6 billion to states and localities in FY 1970--would be borne entirely by the federal government.
Beyond that, state and local government must place greater reliance on their own tax base and on more equitable tax systems. To encourage this, federal programs should be designed to stimulate greater tax effort, tax reform, and structural change at the state and local levels. With the prospect of additional funds, these governments will be more likely to undertake politically difficult reforms than they would be in the absence of such incentives.
13
To achieve these goals, we urge:

A revenue-sharing program exclusively for states and localities. The program’s payment formula should (a) take into account need as well as population, (b) ensure that a substantial portion of the funds will be passed through to the cities, and (c) reward states which make a relatively greater tax effort and which raise a relatively higher proportion of their revenues through a progressive income tax.
A program of general aid to elementary and secondary education, available only to states which assume at least 55 per cent of the costs of such education (in the average state today, the state pays 44 per cent of these costs; local government pays the rest). States paying a higher percentage of these costs would receive relatively more federal money. By providing an incentive for states to assume a greater portion of the costs of public education, this program would greatly relieve the pressure on overburdened local property taxes, which now provide the revenues to pay the lion’s share of these expenses. The funds should be allocated to eligible states primarily on the basis of need.
A revised Model Cities program, adequately funded, which should be changed to focus on entire cities rather than on single neighborhoods. As an incentive for wider metropolitan planning, a single, coordinated application from two or more contiguous communities would, if accepted, be rewarded with funds that would exceed the amount they would have received through separate applications. Also, grants would be awarded

14
only on condition that a specified percentage of the funds would be spent in low-income neighborhoods and that citizen participation in decision-making would be assured.
GOAL FIVE: PROVIDE FOR MILITARY SECURITY
America needs sufficient forces and technology to deter foreign attack. However, the advent of the nuclear age has rendered every country vulnerable to military attack, regardless of how much or how little it spends for national security. Any level of spending requires accepting risks. In this setting, the following are needed to meet our national security requirements:

A credible “second strike” strategic capability which will deter military attacks by making it clear to potential attackers that they will themselves suffer unacceptable levels of damage if they should initiate an attack on the United States.
Adequate general-purpose forces to support our commitments to allied nations whose own security is important to American interests.
Sufficient research and development activity to ensure that our military technology does not become outmoded.

These needs will continue to require multi-billion-dollar expenditures, even with prudent reductions from current expenditure levels.
15
GOAL SIX: MEET FOREIGN ECONOMIC ASSISTANCE OBLIGATIONS
Modern industrialized nations, among which America stands pre-eminent, cannot abandon their responsibility to the developing countries. In recent years, our financial commitment has slackened while the lesser developed nations have grown in their ability to use development assistance funds in a productive way. The first requirement for rapid international development is continued vigorous expansion of world trade. This will be possible only if advanced countries remove many obstacles to the growth of export earnings for less developed economies and encourage the flow of private capital to these nations.
Foreign economic assistance, when granted to help create self-reliance among nations, can also contribute directly to an expanded world economy and to improved prospects for world peace. To be effective, however, our assistance programs must be restructured and redirected. Most fundamentally, the entire program must be based on a less visible U.S. role, and on far more realistic and modest expectations about what our assistance can accomplish. Three specific changes are needed:

The amount of official U.S. development assistance funds should rise from its present level of 0.28 percent of gross national product toward a goal of 0.70 percent of GNP by 1975, as recommended by the Pearson Commission of the World Bank.
The proportion of funds channeled through multilateral institutions such as the World Bank should be substantially increased.
The form of economic assistance should be shifted to greater utilization of grants and soft loans, less of hard loans.

16
III. REQUIREMENTS FOR ACHIEVING THE SIX GOALS
At the beginning of this discussion, we mentioned three requirements for achieving our goals. These requirements--to repeat--are:

Reordering budget priorities--that is, cutting spending in areas of lower priority and applying those funds to areas of higher priority.
Increasing tax revenues--first through achieving a more equitable tax system, then through higher tax rates.
Reorganizing government structures to bring about more responsive and effective delivery of programs and services.

Perhaps it would be useful to discuss briefly what might be done in each of these areas.
Our analysis of present budget priorities suggests several categories where cuts can be made:

Agricultural subsidy programs could wisely be cut by $1.2 billion. In its place, however, farm residents should be provided with expanded non-farm job opportunities, backed up by income assurances through the cash assistance program described on page 11.
Federal highway subsidies could be reduced by about $1 billion a year, with these funds applied to the more urgent need for mass transit.

17

Still more could be saved by reducing expenditures for Army Corps of Engineers public works projects (currently $1.4 billion), merchant marine subsidies ($330 million), and the SST ($275 million).

Dwarfing all of the above, however, is a potential reduction in military spending of about $20 billion. Such a reduction could be achieved through the following actions:

A substantial further reduction from current U.S. military spending in Vietnam, which now accounts for $13 billion of the $73 billion defense budget.
Persuading our allies in Europe and Asia to assume a larger share of defense costs in those areas
Elimination of wastefully duplicative strategic deterrent forces and a cessation of attempts to build unnecessary strategic defense systems, such as Safeguard.
Elimination (without replacement) of systems rendered impotent, and therefore obsolete, by changing technology.
Improved management and operating efficiencies.

All of these reductions can be accomplished without threatening the goal of providing for adequate national security against military threats.
Reduction in defense expenditures should be accompanied by a planned program of reconversion which would provide income assistance, relocation allowances, training and jobs at similar skill levels for workers laid off because of cutbacks in defense spending.
18
Even assuming that all of these proposed budget cuts can be effected, however, more funds will be needed if we are to move far towards meeting our goals. This brings us to our second requirement -- increasing tax revenues. We estimate that a rise of about 10 per cent in individual and corporate income taxes will be needed, assuming that the expenditure cuts suggested above (pages 20 and 21) are made. For every recommended dollar reduction not achieved, taxes will have to be increased correspondingly. These tax increases should not be undertaken immediately because they might interfere with restoration of full employment. But they will be required by the middle of the coming five-year period. Tax increases will become more feasible politically if the public becomes convinced that the tax system is equitable. Thus, reform of the tax structure -- to eliminate the inequities -- must become a first line of attack.
As for our third requirement -- reorganization of governmental structures -- let us first review some of the major reforms already mentioned in our discussion of goals. They call for the federal government to:

Rationalize the process by which the federal budget is assembled and open that process to broader public scrutiny.

19

Provide financial incentives (a) for states to rely on graduated state income taxes, and (b) for individual communities to join together for area-wide planning.
Place all of the responsibility for administration and financing of the proposed income-maintenance program in the hands of the federal government.
Take measures that would help to achieve a better and more widely available delivery of health services.
Effect changes that would bring more investment funds into the mortgage market and streamline the federally subsidized housing programs.

Other reforms -- many of them involving no expenditure at all -- must also be sought if the government is to become more effective. Among them would be:

A requirement that municipalities provide housing for low- and moderate-income residents as a condition of their receiving federal aid.
Provisions to allow citizens to participate meaningfully in the design of programs that directly affect them.
Assignment of a higher priority to consumer affairs in the federal government, as well as stronger enforcement of regulations and laws in this area.
Stricter federal legislation against environmental pollution, along with stronger enforcement of existing laws.
A restructuring of the family planning assistance program to ensure that these services can be obtained by all

20
The reforms listed here are meant to be suggestive, not comprehensive. They are intended to demonstrate directions that the federal government should take. Their purpose, in each case, is to assure that programs and laws serve the ends for which they were devised.
Without such reforms, we risk simply throwing money away, or worse, achieving undesirable results. Governmental bureaucracy must be made as efficient and responsive as possible. Most of the major new program initiatives we have recommended which will cost large sums of money -- National Health Insurance, cash assistance program, revenue sharing, including general aid to education -- require very simple administrative mechanisms. The Federal government role in these programs is almost completely that of collecting and dispensing monies.
IV. THE WILL TO ACT
There is little room for doubt about our ability to reach the goals we have outlined. The economy can supply the resources, while preserving the freedom of enterprise that has made it the envy of the world. The government, properly reformed, can deliver the services. The programs we have suggested are not revolutionary or, in most cases, even new. Most have been discussed in this country for years, and many have long been public policy in Western European nations.
21
The one remaining question concerns our national will. Whenever there has been the prospect of a budget surplus, Americans have traditionally chosen the fruits of tax reductions in preference to the support of domestic needs with public funds. Will we soon be ready to make the sacrifices--particularly in the form of higher taxes--that will be needed to reach our goals? If not, we may later lament it. If so, we can no longer delay. We must forge the national commitment and see it through.

as well as legislative programs whose success may depend on the nature and intensity of the support they receive from the White House.
PART II. RECOMMENDATIONS
A. Economic Security and Economic Development
1. Manpower and Employment Rights
RECOMMENDATION 1: Within the framework of a comprehensive manpower planning program, this Administration should provide permanent job creation programs -- with jobs in the public sector targeted to the areas of persistent unemployment and underemployment without regard to national employment rates. These jobs must be useful and desirable and have adequate wages and supportive services. Present manpower programs fail to deal adequately with the gaps between national rates and the critically higher jobless rates for blacks and other minorities in urban and rural ghettos.
RECOMMENDATION 2: A federal job creation program in the public service fields must be adopted. Such a program should initially provide a minimum of 500,000 productive jobs during the first six months of operation, and 600,000 in the second six months in this one program alone, with additional jobs in other programs to meet the unemployment crisis.
9
RECOMMENDATION 3: A minimum of 1 million NYC jobs should be provided for in-school youth during the summer.*[Handwritten asterisk in margin] Present planning in this area is totally inadequate. The jobs should be provided by the federal government with no local matching fund requirement and should be for 10-32 hour weeks at not less than $1.60 an hour. This program must be understood to be no substitute for the needs addressed in Recommendation 1.
RECOMMENDATION 4: Basic changes must be made in federal recruitment, testing, and promotion policies and day-to-day Administration to insure blacks and other oppressed minority peoples equal results to whites in the middle and upper levels of federal employment.
RECOMMENDATION 5: Executive Order 11246 must be enforced, requiring affirmative action by government contractors and subcontractors to provide equal employment opportunities and to extend the requirement of goals and timetables for achievement to all government contractors and subcontractors.
RECOMMENDATION 6: We call for vigorous support for expansion of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 to provide cease and desist power to the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, coverage of employers of eight or more persons, and to eliminate the present exemption of state and local governments,
10
and educational institutions.
RECOMMENDATION 7: At a time when blacks are fighting and dying in disproportionate numbers in Indochina, we urge the White House to initiate a thorough investigation of the status of blacks and other minorities in the Veterans Administration -- 90 per cent of whose black classified employees are in grades GS-8 or below. The investigation and the remedial action which must follow should include not only equal employment opportunity within the Veteran’s Administration, but should focus on closing the critically wide gap between the needs of black veterans and the inadequate and uncoordinated existing programs of the Veterans Administration, the Department of Labor, Housing and Urban Development, and other federal agencies.
2. Welfare Reform
RECOMMENDATION 1: We recommend that the present welfare system be replaced by a guaranteed adequate income system. We oppose any welfare reform which fails to establish a satisfactory timetable for reaching a guaranteed adequate income system of a minimum of $6,500 a year for a family of four from cash assistance, wages or both.
RECOMMENDATION 2: Any federalization of existing welfare programs must have as an ultimate objective the realization of individual economic self-sufficiency. The federalized
11
programs should guarantee the standardization of eligibility requirements, the establishment of adequate payment standards, the elimination of abusive and degrading administrative practices, and the provision of suitable work opportunities which maximize individual freedom of choice and self-respect.
RECOMMENDATION 3: Until a fully operational cash assistance program is established, we urge you. Mr. President, to direct the appropriate federal agencies to overhaul the food assistance delivery system, so that the minimum standards and goals of existing legislation can be guaranteed. Further, the necessary budgetary revisions (or supplemental budget requests) should be made so that the needs of all children eligible for free or reduced-price school breakfast or lunch programs by 1972 are met.
3. Federal Assistance to State and Local Government
The Caucus recognizes that the concept of revenue sharing is already operative and that the issue is really one of block grants versus categorical grants. The federal government has been sharing federally-collected tax money revenue with states, cities, counties, and individuals for the past forty years. The Caucus would, however, support a form of federal assistance to state and local governments with the following provisions:
(1) Assurance that the funds will be spent in ways or
12
in the amounts that will benefit the poor and the minorities who are least able to prevail in the inevitable contests at the local level that are bound to be waged over such expenditures.
(2) Allowance for the participation of neighborhood and other community units in planning and in the decisions about how funds will be spent.
(3) Enforcement of civil rights laws with respect to the expenditure of federal funds.
(4) Incentives for states to shift from forms of taxation that fall most heavily on low-income families to more progressive income taxes.
RECOMMENDATION 1: Immediate, short-term financial assistance should be afforded local communities by releasing frozen funds for development projects, closing the growing authorization/appropriations gap, and by expeditiously proposing and strongly supporting an emergency public service employment bill.
RECOMMENDATION 2: We strongly recommend that the program of welfare nationalization and reform called for in Recommendations 1 and 2 under Welfare Reform should not be considered as an alternative to the Administration’s general “revenue-sharing” proposal.
RECOMMENDATION 3: The population-based distribution
13
formula in the Administration’s “revenue-sharing” bill must be altered to more accurately target the funds to places of maximum need. Specifically, we would recommend that one per cent (1%) of the individual tax base be distributed to all categorized welfare disbursing units on a basis reflecting the proportion of national welfare costs paid by that unit during 1970, providing that the unit maintains its 1970 welfare effort.
RECOMMENDATION 4: The distribution apparatus of the present proposal for “revenue-sharing” must be changed to funnel more funds to major urban centers, i.e., 1.5% of the [X handwritten in margin] individual tax base be distributed to all local units not sharing in Recommendation 3 above and which have a population of 50,000 or more.
RECOMMENDATION 5: The civil rights guidelines set forth in the Administration’s “revenue-sharing” package must be greatly strengthened, particularly in regards to equal employment hiring, and an effective compliance program.
RECOMMENDATION 6: Although we support general “revenue-sharing” to states and localities, under the conditions set forth above, to assist in the provision of basic services, we are opposed to the apparent abandonment of national leadership in such areas as education, housing, etc. that would result from proposed program “revenue-sharing.” While states and localities
14
can be given more flexibility in administering federal grants, national priorities requiring accountability for delivering services to those most in need of them must be maintained.
4. Minority Economic Development 
RECOMMENDATION 1: An independent agency should be organized as a non-profit quasi-public, publicly-funded development bank for consolidation of present programs intended to assist minority business, and should receive an initial annual appropriation of 1 billion dollars. This agency should be under the direction of a board with broadly representative minority membership.
RECOMMENDATION 2: A federally-financed guarantee organization similar to the Government National Mortgage Association should be created to insure securities and obligations of community development corporations -- firms providing employment for and owned by residents of low-income areas.
RECOMMENDATION 3: In addition to increased federal support and employment of direct set-aside programs for all procurement, we urge you to support the enactment of legislation requiring that contractors working on federally-assisted and financed projects, set aside a specified percentage of their subcontract work for minority firms.
RECOMMENDATION 4: Federal management and technical
15
assistance should be increased and made more broadly available to minority trade associations, development corporations, and other organizations of minority businessmen, with assistance provided more as an aid than as an audit.
RECOMMENDATION 5: Funding for Community Development Corporations should be increased to at least 50 million dollars for the development of community-based minority business ownership.
RECOMMENDATION 6: The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation should be authorized and directed, by specific legislation, to use some of its assets to provide technical assistance to minority banks. No federal or quasi-federal agency presently provides technical assistance to these institutions, with the result that other kinds of programs (such as the $100 million deposit program) are less effective than they would be otherwise.
5. Poverty Programming
RECOMMENDATION 1: We urge the Administration to abandon any plans -- now or two years hence -- which will weaken the programs now under the aegis of the Office of Economic Opportunity and submerge them in existing agencies or in a broader plan for government reorganization. We believe that converting the Office of Economic Opportunity to a research
16
and evaluation organization will deprive the poor of an advocate agency in Washington. Further, we recommend the restoration of the $116 million by which the Economic Opportunity Act was reduced in the fiscal year 1972, and a substantial increase in anti-poverty funds for the following fiscal year, and the elimination of the matching requirement which makes it impossible for some communities to participate in the program.
RECOMMENDATION 2: We support the continued existence and expansion of the OEO legal services. We urge that new guidelines be drawn and new legislation be proposed which would limit the power of state and local authorities to intervene politically in the operation of these programs. Should this prove infeasible, we recommend that every low income American citizen be guaranteed access to free, quality legal assistance through the establishment of a National Legal Services Corporation.
B. Community and Human Development
1. Education
RECOMMENDATION 1: We urge you, Mr. President, to initiate (and/or support) such a child development legislation and to require the promulgations of such administrative regulations for existing child development programs, which incorporate the following principles: a) significant expansion of
17
child development services; b) developmental rather than custodial programming; c) child development services provided as a right rather than as a mandatory eligibility requirements; d) encouragement of educational innovation and reform; e) the validity of programs designed by and in accordance with the special needs of minority groups; and f) consumer control.
In conjunction with the support of minority business enterprises, special assistance should be provided to minorities for the development of day care and other child development programs. The grant system should be adopted, as opposed to the voucher system. Further, the federal government should issue grant and/or funds directly to day care institutions.
RECOMMENDATION 2: We recommend a strong program which enforces the priorities established by Congress under Title I of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965. In addition we recommend that this title be fully funded in advance so that educational systems may plan a continuing program of high quality as was true during the time of the Morrill Land Grant Act of 100 years ago.
RECOMMENDATION 3: We specifically urge that the Administration abandon its plans to consolidate federal education legislation into a program of block grants.
18
RECOMMENDATION 4: We urge this Administration to support pending legislation that is designed to provide quality integration education so that the concept of equal educational opportunity will become a reality for blacks and others among the oppressed in the country
RECOMMENDATION 5: We support and call on the Administration to make real its own announced commitment to universal literacy for every American in this decade.
Because illiteracy will be even more crippling for our citizens in the 1970’s and 1980’s than at any previous time in our history, we urge that the Administration revive and strongly fund and support a national “Right to Read” program like that originally proposed by your own first Commissioner of Education.
RECOMMENDATION 6: We specifically urge that the federal government increase substantially its financial support for predominantly black institutions of higher education in order to insure their growth and expansion. For immediate relief of black colleges we recommend the full funding of $91 million authorized in the Developing Institutions Program of Title III of the Higher Education Act of 1965, and the elimination of the matching fund requirement.
19
RECOMMENDATION 7: We recommend, Mr. President, that you arrange to convene a meeting of the officials of black institutions of higher education with the heads of major federal agencies and departments such as the National Science Foundation, Department of Labor, Department of Agriculture, HUD, and HEW, to consider how black colleges may have greater access to the funds, programs and technical assistance of those agencies.
RECOMMENDATION 8: While we would support a request for 70 percent increase in student aids in grant and work study over the previous fiscal year, we would strongly request reconsideration of the change in formula which reduces from approximately $1,800 to $1,000, the amount of grant and work study funds. A high proportion of black students now attending or hoping to enter our colleges, would not be able to sustain the financial burden of the loans now being proposed. We would support the proposed increase in the availability of subsidized grants to students whose family incomes are less than $10,000 per annum. We would recommend, however, (1) that existing grant and loan programs for student financial assistance be continued at least at current levels until the proposed programs become operational; (2) the ceiling in terms of family incomes be raised to $15,000
20
per annum; and (3) that interest rates on the available loans be stabilized.
Student financial aid for most black students must assume little or no family financial aid. They need money for almost all their costs. We therefore believe that the major emphasis should be placed on grants rather than loans in supporting their education
RECOMMENDATION 9: We recommend that the Administration give strong support to the establishment and maintenance of community colleges. We ask you to direct the Department of Health, Education of Welfare, the Department of Labor, and the Office of Economic Opportunity to work with the appropriate public officials and private citizens to restructure vocational, technical, and post-secondary education for the 70’s and 80’s. A critical aspect of this mission must be making certain that community colleges do not become dumping grounds for the children of the poor and near-poor. We are concerned that community colleges develop into one of the strongest and most flexible links in the continuing education in which millions of our people must be involved at various stages in their lives if they are not to be crippled by dead-end or unmarketable skills, or by undeveloped capacities as citizens and human beings.
21
2. Housing and Urban Development
RECOMMENDATION 1: We call for the immediate release of supplemental FY 1971 funds of $150 million for the public housing. This can be accomplished immediately by Presidential action.
RECOMMENDATION 2: We recommend the implementation of the Uniform Relocation Act to insure an adequate stock of low and moderate income housing for displaced persons. Immediate action by the President could achieve the implementation.
RECOMMENDATION 3: We urge you to support legislation to amend the Housing Act so that urban renewal money may be used for housing development projects other than new construction.
RECOMMENDATION 4: The Department of Housing and Urban Development should institute and enforce a uniform policy of site selection applicable to all of its departmental programs. The current regulations of the Department of Housing and Urban Development affecting site selections apply only to low rent housing. All other Housing and Urban Development programs, including Sections 235 and 236, should be brought under this policy to insure that they expand opportunities for black citizens and avoid reinforcement of segregation.
22
Immediate executive action in this area is possible.
RECOMMENDATION 5: We strongly urge the amendment of Executive Order 11512 (1970) concerning the selection of sites for federal installations, in accordance with the U.S. Commission on Civil Rights’ recommendation on “Federal Installations and Equal Housing Opportunity” to assure that communities are, in fact, open to all economic and racial groups as a condition of eligibility for location of federal installations.
RECOMMENDATION 6: Tax legislation providing favorable treatment of investment in new and rehabilitated housing should be broadened to provide identical preference to investment in any inner-city real property development, sponsored or substantially-owned by a community development corporation or other organization of minority or low-income citizens.
3. The Drug Crisis
RECOMMENDATION 1: We strongly urge that drug abuse and addiction be declared a major national crisis. We call upon this Administration to use all existing resources to stop the illegal entry of drugs into the United States, including suspension of economic and military assistance to any country which fails to take appropriate steps to prevent narcotic drugs produced or processed in that country from entering the
23
United States unlawfully.
RECOMMENDATION 2: We recommend that funds be made available to every major city for the establishment of ambulatory detoxification and rehabilitation centers. Federal financial support should likewise be extended to reinforce the local initiatives developed in many communities to address this problem.
RECOMMENDATION 3: Amphetamine abuse programs, beginning with Food and Drug Administration restraints on present overproduction and overuse, should be upgraded substantially. Special emphasis should be given cooperatively by the FDA and the Office of Education to restraint of the application of amphetamine drugs to control school children. We are concerned about the danger that such drugs might be given to children not adequately diagnosed as hyperkinetic.
RECOMMENDATION 4: Substantial federal funds should be made available to study the long-range social and physiological effects of the broad use of methadone as an alternative to heroin addiction. The Food and Drug Administration of the Department of Health, Education and Welfare should take the initiative in establishing safeguards which will eliminate the careless, and often unsupervised, dispensing of methadone.
24
RECOMMENDATION 5: Since organized crime is the principal distributive mechanism of hard narcotics, we urge that Justice Department manpower for investigation and prosecution in that area be substantially increased.
RECOMMENDATION 6: A cabinet level federal task force on drug abuse should be appointed, with broad representation, including the Justice Department, the Department of State, HEW and other federal agencies relevant to this problem. This task force should be mandated to design a government-wide action strategy for eliminating drug abuse. A task force report should be made public, and implementation begun within six months.
C. Justice and Civil Rights
1. Criminal Justice
RECOMMENDATION 1: We urge that the President and the Attorney General direct the Law Enforcement Assistance Administration (LEAA) to do the following: (1) support law reform and basic changes in the present system rather than the excessive purchase of weapons and equipment; (2) insure adequate minority, urban and community-level representation on planning boards at all levels; (3) guarantee vigorous Title VI enforcement in regard to grantees; and (4) make certain that urban areas, particularly inner-city communities, are
25
assisted in developing effective and fair criminal justice systems.
RECOMMENDATION 2: We urge you, Mr. President, to appoint black federal judges and other legal officials, including U.S. Attorneys, U.S. Marshals, federal correctional officers, and other Justice Department employees in every region of the country. We note with considerable concern that you have appointed only one black judge outside the District of Columbia. We feel it is especially important that black federal judges be appointed in the South.
RECOMMENDATION 3: We are disturbed that the D.C. Court Reform and Criminal Procedure Act of 1970 has been advertised as a model for the nation, inasmuch as we feel that some of its provisions clearly impinge on the constitutional rights of suspects and defendants. Such other laws with similarly constitutionally odious provisions are the Organized Crime Control Act of 1970. None of these ought to be so advertised as models, and we strongly urge that the Administration sponsor legislation to repeal such sections of those acts as the “no-knock” and preventative detention provisions as inimical to the interests of a free society.
2. Civil Rights
RECOMMENDATION 1: We call for the full implementation of the 1970 Report of the U.S. Commision on Civil Rights,
26
and request that the findings derived from the White House inquiries of the 26 federal agencies be shared with the Black Caucus as well as with the U.S. Commission on Civil Rights.
RECOMMENDATION 2: We urge you, Mr. President, to instruct the Attorney General to move promptly to investigate and take corrective action on efforts to disenfranchise blacks and other minorities in the South and Southwest -- especially in thirty-three counties in Mississippi. In addition, we urge that you instruct the Attorney General to take prompt and decisive action to investigate and take remedial action concerning allegations of attempted vote fraud in Gary, Indiana, and that similar action be taken wherever attempts are made to disadvantage and disenfranchise minority voters.
RECOMMENDATION 3: We recommend that you instruct the Office of Management and Budget to establish an adequately staffed division on civil rights with properly trained persons, which would monitor every department and agency to insure that all civil rights legislation and executive policies are implemented. Further, this agency should issue periodic public reports of its findings.
3. Veterans’ Affairs
RECOMMENDATION 1: We recommend, Mr. President, that you direct the Department of Defense, Justice, and State
27
--assisted by selected members of the bar, including minority representatives--to investigate the quality of justice meted out to black and other minority servicemen. The investigation should also examine the conditions under which blacks and other minority servicemen are incarcerated in military prisons here and abroad. The resulting report and recommendations for action should be submitted to you, the appropriate committees of Congress, and the public.
RECOMMENDATION 2: We urge the Administration to recommend and support legislation to establish a Civil Rights Division within the Department of Defense and to prescribe by law the personnel, funding, and procedure for handling complaints of racial discrimination against military personnel, both on and off base, in the United States and abroad.
4. District of Columbia
RECOMMENDATION 1: We urge you, Mr. President, to lend the vigorous support of your Administration to legislation providing for:
(1) full Congressional voting representation for the District of Columbia;
(2) Home Rule for the District, including an elected Mayor and City Council;
28
(3) a just and adequate federal payment formula to provide revenues necessary to make the District of Columbia a model for the nation.
D. Foreign Policy
RECOMMENDATION 1: We call upon you to effect disengagement from Southeast Asia as soon as possible, preferably by the end of 1971, and definitely within the life of the 92nd Congress.
RECOMMENDATION 2: We call for drastic reduction in our military expenditures, and the redirection of these funds to finance much needed domestic programs -- such as economic security and economic development, community and urban development, justice and civil rights, and many other unfulfilled interests of the black community.
RECOMMENDATION 3: Mr. President, following World War II Europe was the recipient of massive aid through the Marshall Plan and Japan was rebuilt essentially through American assistance. In the sixties the Alliance for Progress was conceived and funded for the benefit of Latin America, and the Middle East continues to receive a significant input of our resources. We feel strongly that Africa’s turn is overdue. Africa must be given priority and attention on an equal basis with other parts of the world. Over the past few years, Africa
29
has received only 8.5% of American aid; we believe this percentage should be increased significantly -- to at least 15%.
We recommend that a special Task Force be created in the Executive Branch, composed of ranking members of the Departments of State, Commerce, Defense, and other pertinent agencies, where the variety of American policies dealing with Africa can be reviewed in a comprehensive manner and whose recommendations would be effectively implemented. In addition, several recognized experts of long time interest in this continent should be included, (e.g. Member of Congress, academicians, journalists, and businessmen.)
U.S. representatives to the World Bank, the International Monetary Fund and the International Development Association should request those organizations to allocate increasing shares of multi-lateral resources for Africa.
We support broader U.S. participation in the African Development Bank and we urge that our government provide soft funds with other donors for the Bank.
RECOMMENDATION 4: United States relations with Southern Africa are in need of a major overhaul. This country should take the lead in isolating the Republic of South Africa, the world’s most racist nation. Disincentives should be developed to discourage the expansion of further private American
30
investment there. On the other hand, private American enterprise should be encouraged to seriously examine the potential for profitable investment in other parts of Africa.
We urge the Administration to actively support legislation proposing the withdrawal of the United States sugar quota for the Republic of South Africa, and its reallocation to other Africa countries. We further urge the Administration to implement the United States pronouncements in the United Nations to help liberate the remaining areas under colonial rule in Africa.
The House Subcommittee on Africa submitted a comprehensive report on Southern Africa to the Administration as a result of its extensive travels and hearings. The recommendations of this report and others it has rendered should be seriously considered.
RECOMMENDATION 5: Of all major industrial nations, the United States has for years allocated less proportionately for international development efforts. We propose that the United States directed at least 1% of its annual gross national product for international aid, with priority attention to Africa. (It must be noted that about 75% of all United States foreign aid funds have been spent for U.S. goods and services.)
31
RECOMMENDATION 6: We urge that blacks and other minorities be given a greater role in the making of foreign policy. We also as the Administration to increase its recruitment of minority Americans for foreign policy positions, as well as to improve the upgrading procedures regarding minorities within the State Department and related agencies."

8 years ago/[illegible], Ala
When Paul Goodman published Growing Up Absurd in 1960, he electrified the public with his description of the shattering impact on the young generation of the spiritual emptiness of contemporary society.
The early sixties brought forth vocal protest about the right of people to eat, sleep, ride, read, write and live up to the equality set aside in a Bill of Rights and a Declaration of Independence. Shattering indeed was it for the majority of white Americans to see a movement lead by Black men and women determined to change a way of life that deprived brother and sisters of color the right to equality.
Today, young Americans are fighting, dying and killing in Asian jungles in a war whose purposes are so ambiguous the whole nation seethes with dissent. From 1960 when Goodman published his book until today and the war against the people of Indochina we have had thousands of political prisoners. It was In the early sixties it was the nonviolent protests against discrimination. In the middle sixties it was Black brothers and sisters who proclaimed their pride and Blackness. And it was by the end of the sixties and with the beginning of the seventies the brothers and sisters who were being held captive by a
2
system that they sought to change. Repression of thought became the way of life.
Angela Davis is a victim of that repression. A Black woman of intellect, beauty, love and awareness. A teacher in a society that repressed those who think. A doer who sought to change a nation that spends its full time in smoke filled rooms plotting to stop change. Angela is a political prisoner held by frustrated white men who are intimidated by her politics of freedom for Black and poor people. She is a symbol of thousands of revolutionaries whose fate is not different than hers.
She has been charged in a conspiracy. But I ask what conspiracy? A conspiracy to feed hungry people.? A conspiracy to say to America that Black people will not remain in shackles in your ghettoes.? A conspiracy to say that inhumanity to man will bring down the human race.
A conspiracy to say that the prisons of America are repression centers for the poor, the Black, the Chicano, the Puerto Ricans who are trapped in America.
The truth of the matter is that it is not a conspiracy.
The attempted escape by prisoners in the courtroom in San Rafael, California, was an act of desperation calling public attention to the
3
inhumanity of the prison system in our country. The resulting loss of lives is a tragedy second only to the larger tragedy that the American national conscience is never moved to correct injustice unless the victims find some dramatic way to focus attention on their plight.
As usual, the government is attempting to deflect public attention away from the barbarous conditions in the prisons by creating a typical lynch spirit in connection with the Davis trial. Angela Davis has been charged with ""murder and kidnapping"" even though she was not on the scene when the shootout between the prisoners and police and the kidnapping took place. She has already been tried by the press and put on Hoover’s prestigious Ten Most Wanted list all over the country.
Since Angela Davis was born in Birmingham, and was active in the movement here in the early 1960's, it is appropriate to call attention to the fact that no one was ever put on the Ten Most Wanted list for bombing the Sixteenth Street Baptist Church that Sunday morning in 1963 when four little Black girls were killed in Sunday school, or for bombing the Gaston Motel where Dr. King and other leaders of the movement had been staying during the Birmingham crisis.
The issue in Angela’s case is that the prison system in America is rotten to the core. Graft and racism are the everyday experiences of the inmates, that is to say... under socially backward, petty, vindictive officials.
The government's long standing record of inaction regarding
4
prison these conditions and its equally pernicious record of tapping phones of civil rights leaders, spreading gossip to the press, and bugging private conversations mean it has earned no credibility and deserves not to be believed.
Angela Davis is another victim by white America crucified for being Black. Another victim of the ""crusade against communism"" psychosis and the law and order backlash brigade. She is Black and she is a Communist. This country is titillated by the former, threatened by the latter, and terrified of the combination.
During the early 1950's the hangman operating with the Cold War troops was McCarthyism. For years it decimated social organizations, throttled free expression, and intimidated into bleak silence not only liberal and radicals but men in high and protected places. A very small bond of courageous people fought back, braving ostracism, slander and loss of livelihood. Gradually and painfully, however, the democratic instinct of America was awakened, and the ideological brute force was routed.
However, McCarthyism left a legacy of social paralysis. Fear persisted through succeeding years, and social reform remained inhibited and defensive. A blanket of conformity and intimidatlion conditioned
5
young and old to exalt mediocrity and convention. Criticism of the social order was still imbued with implications of treason. The wasr in Korea was unpopular, but it was never subject to the searching criticisms and mass demonstrations that currently characterize opposition to the war in Southeast Asia.
The blanket of fear was lifted by Black youth. When they took their struggle to the streets, a new spirit of resistance was born. Inspired by the boldness and ingenuity of Black people, white youth stirred into action and formed an alliance that aroused the conscience of the nation.
Today we find increasingly parallels to the 1950 McCarthy period. In many ways we need as many people who have come out for one day, Million ? Peace Marches, to exert fulltime pressure to the question of Nixon-Agnew-Mitchell-Hoover's 1970 version of McCarthyism. The people must not be silent. Our voices must be heard. Those who cry for peace in Vietnam must see also the victims of the war at home. We cannot be totally free until Angela Davis and all political prisoners are free, even if we bring all the troops home from Southeast Asia.
Thus we must see repression clearly. We in the South particularly if we are Black but also if we are of low income and or today have long hair have witnessed some of the most degrading forms of repression.

Black people have been slaves for 300 years for the rich white landowner. This repression has continued in even the right to choose your government and still exists in forms of daily intimidation that Black and poor people face when they still even attempt to vote in places like Humphries County, Mississippi. Repression is not an accident.
Repression threatens all Americans. The government punishes welfare mothers and allows welfare millionaires to stay rich and not grow food while there is widespread hunger. There are 15 million hungry Americans and 6 million jobless Americans. This is repression. The government approves white racist rule of the schools and de-humanizing systems of education. This is repression. The setting up of massive snooping machines are but readying for the police state. The concocting of phoney conspiracy trials, the illegal no-knocks and the imprisonment of revolutionary brothers and sisters are but simple hints of what is to come, if we do not speak out.
The government and the military disrespect the will of the people by conducting a secret, criminal, racist wasr and drafting our young men into death. No, repression is not an accident, and it is not isolated. And it is not long if we are silent and about the business as usual before we too are, too, behind bars and facing death.
7
If we do not succeed in stirring up those who say they are our allies now, it will result in not alone death for Angela Davis, but in a most critical loss of freedom for us all.
It is our task to awaken our brothers and sisters and tell the world that Angela Davis is innocent and that her freedom will hasten the freedom of other innocent victims of political and racist repression, whether they be Black, Chicano, Puerto Rican, or whites who have fought for justice and aroused the anger of those in power.
America has tried to close us out and kill us. Over the past three centuries we have been hung, lynched, castrated, raped and robbed of our dignity, manhood and sisterhood. We were not only treated as second class citizens, we were treated as animals. We have finally concluded that we are not about to be dehumanized any more. We see clearly that a brother or sister in need means it also is us in need. We see that the phrases such as Black capitalism and Black entrepreneurship are the bait to begin to make us hate one another. We see the divisive means of a powerful propagandized division machine of white America to call us off. But it won't work. We are no longer callous, lazy or shiftless as the white man once had himself believe. We are a power of beautiful Black color that is a community. His polls cannot reflect the brotherhood that we know. His TV cannot reflect a life that doesn't exist. The truth is we as

Black people will have to remain revolutionaries. That change will come through struggle and freedom through our hard work.

Angela Davis knows that it is may be the fate of all Black people to wind up in a cell somewhere, their freedom severely limited.

The early sixties brought forth vocal protest about the right of people to eat, sleep, ride, read, write and live up to the equality set aside in a Bill of Rights and a Declaration of Independence. Shattered indeed was it for the majority of white Americans to see a movement lead by Black men and women determined to change a way of life that deprived brother and sisters of color the right to equality.
Today, young Americans are fighting, dying and killing in Asian jungles in a war whose purposes are so ambiguous the whole nation seethes with dissent. From 1960 when Goodman published his book until today and the war against the people of Indochina we have had thousands of political prisoners. It was in the early sixties the nonviolent protests against discrimination. In the middle sixties it was Black brothers and sisters who proclaimed their pride and Blackness. And it was by the end of the sixties and with the beginning of the seventies the brothers and sisters who were being held captive by a
2
system that they sought to change. Repression of thought became the way of life.
Angela Davis is a victim of that repression. A Black woman of intellect, beauty, love and awareness. A teacher in a society that represses those who think. A doer who sought to change a nation that spends its full time in smoke filled rooms plotting to stop change. Angela is a political prisoner held by frustrated white men who are intimidated by her politics of freedom for Black and poor people. She is a symbol of thousands of revolutionaries whose fate is no different than hers.
She has been charged in a conspiracy. But I ask what conspiracy? A conspiracy to feed hungry people. A conspiracy to say to America that Black people will not remain in shackles in your ghettoes. A conspiracy to say that inhumanity to man will bring down the human race.
A conspiracy to say that the prisons of America are repression centers for the poor, the Black, the Chicano, the Puerto Ricans who are trapped in America.
The truth of the matter is that it is not a conspiracy.
The attempted escape by prisoners in the courtroom in San Rafael, California, was an act of desperation calling public attention to the
3
inhumanity of the prison system in our country. The resulting loss of lives is a tragedy second only to the larger tragedy that the American national conscience is never moved to correct injustice unless the victims find some dramatic way to focus attention on their plight.
As usual, the government is attempting to deflect public attention away from the barbarous conditions in the prisons by creating a typical lynch spirit in connection with the Davis trial. Angela Davis has been charged with ""murder and kidnapping"" even though she was not on the scene when the shootout between the prisoners and police and the kidnapping took place. She has already been tried by the press and put on Hoover's prestigious Ten Most Wanted list all over the country.
Since Angela Davis was born in Birmingham, and was active in the movement here in the early 1960's, it is appropriate to call attention to the fact that no one was ever put on the Ten Most Wanted list for bombing the Sixteenth Street Baptist Church that Sunday morning in 1963 when four little Black girls were killed in Sunday School, or for bombing the Gaston Motel where Dr. King and other leaders of the movement had been staying during the Birmingham crisis.
The issue in Angela’s case is that the prison system in America is rotten to the core. Graft and racism are the everyday experiences of the inmates under socially backward, petty, vindictive officials.
The government's long standing record of inaction regarding
4
prison conditions and its equally pernicious record of tapping phones of civil rights leaders, spreading gossip to the press, and bugging private conversations mean it has earned no credibility and deserves not to be believed.
Angela Davis is another victim of white America for being Black. Another victim of the ""crusade against communism"" psychosis and the law and order backlash brigade. She is Black and she is a Communist. This country is titillated by the former, threatened by the latter, and terrified of the combination.
During the early 1950's the hangman operating with the Cold War troops was McCarthyism. For years it decimated social organizations, throttled free expression, and intimidated into bleak silence not only liberal and radicals but men in high and protected places. A very small bond of courageous people fought back, braving ostracism, slander and loss of livelihood, gradually and painfully, however, the democratic instinct of America was awakened, and the ideological brute force was routed.
However, McCarthyism left a legacy of social paralysis. Fear persisted through succeeding years, and social reform remained inhibited and defensive. A blanket of conformity and intimidation conditioned

In 1941, Black Americans threatened a massive march on Washington if President Roosevelt didn't order desegregation of all federal departments. He did so swiftly, averted a march, and labor leader A. Philip Randolph commented on why the response had been so swift:
""The threat of the march on Washington proved one thing: the Negro gets only what he has the power to take...We have the masses on the street behind us and that gives us the power to make conferences produce something.""
Mr. Randolph's threat in '41 became confrontation and coercion: the streets of the '40s, '50s, and '60s have become the ballot boxes of the '70s.
The last two-and-one half decades of Black struggle in American life have produced some marvelous victories, often overlooked today as unemployment increases and the economic system nears chaos.
Gains were won at lunch counters and movie theatres and polling places and bus stations and the fabric of legal apartheid in America was destroyed. What had been a movement for civil rights has become a political movement, and Black men and women won office and power only dreamed of before.
2
But despite an increase of 150% in the number of Blacks holding office, despite the ability to sit or eat or ride or vote in places that formerly lacked Black faces, in a real way we find our condition unchanged.
A quick look at every statistic that measures how well or poorly a group of people is doing--infant mortality rates, median family income, life expectancy--shows that while our general condition has improved, our relative condition has actually worsened.
It is almost as though we were climbing a molasses mountain dressed in snowshoes, while everyone else rides a rather leisurely ski-lift to the top. Now the ski slopes are more treacherous and the molasses melting into mud, a Sargasseo Sea of crime in high places, of joblessness for many and hopelessness for more.
Yesterday's gains become suspect. The bus front seat loses meaning for a people whose longest trip is likely to be from the feudal system of the rural South to the mechanized, high-rise poverty of the North.
The right to vote loses meaning for a people forced to choose between Tweedledum and Tweedledee.
The right to an integrated education can mean little to children bussed from one ignorant academy to another.
The struggles of the Sixties were carried forward against discrimination in housing, employment, education and government, both
3
because the victims became their own best champions and because they found a sympathetic ear in the body politic.
But as the demands became more strident, as a foreign war drained treasury and manhood, as the best and brightest were beaten down by bullets, a shift occurred in the national consciousness.
We stand now near our 200th birthday as a people--afraid of what the future will bring and afraid to look too critically at our past, afraid to assign guilt and responsibility for our common condition.
A look backward shows decades of movement, agitation and protest whose results are suspect today.
So much has happened in the United States since the beginning of this decade. The mind literally refuses to negotiate the torturous maze of events that frustrates our will to recall where we were so that we might assess where we are and predict where we're going for the duration of this century.
A monstrous war slaughtered our young. Even those who survived the bombs and the bullets came home to a country that yawned in their anguished faces. No jobs! No sympathy! Not even a parade! What Johnny came marching home to this time...from Detroit to Dubuque...were politicians begging indulgence for a roaring recession and an overheated, inflationary economy. And guess who was getting burned?
4
Watergate became more than an apartment building to live in. Richard Nixon turned it into a shameful nightmare we were forced to live with. More than just a residential-commercial complex crowded against the banks of the Potomac, Watergate came to symbolize for millions of Americans the lengths to which moronic moral midgets will go to cool their Potomac fever.
Our money is becoming counterfeit in world money markets. Our foreign policy bears the stamp of Kissinger's kiss of death. Domestic policy suffers for the lack of any attention at all. Schools no longer educate our young. And our young, knowing nothing, are nodding in the doorways of abandoned cities while hoping things will go better with ""coke"". For Black America, the tentative economic gains of the Sixties are slowly but surely slipping from our grasp. For Black America, it is still true, despite the war on poverty which we apparently lost, that one-third of all Black children still live in poverty...a fact that bodes ill for the future Black generations. It is still true that a Black college graduate stands a great chance of earning less money over a lifetime of employment than will a white high school dropout.
After such a hopeful start on domestic problems in America in the Sixties, it has seemed over the past five years as if a plague has been visited upon us. I know it is painful to plunge headlong back through modern history to view the stark misery of a people about to enter this decade. But think back with me to the year 1970. Let's think back to where Black America was then so we
[The speech content skips from page 4 to 10.]

thus it would seem that Blacks are not all that wrong to be suspicious of promises to return power from Washington to local areas when they we see themselves ourselves grossly under-represented in elective offices, even in those many situations where their our numbers are dominant, sometimes even more than 50 percent of the total population.
With all of these pluses and minuses standing side by side, it appears that Black America has opted for political participation as a way to wedge their way into the significant, decision-making power councils of America. And it appears that unless and until some better idea comes along, Black America will invest considerable energy, time and faith in some form of political action to achieve the aims we have been struggling to capture since we arrived in America in 1619.
From that day to this 1619 until today , our struggle has been a battle to achieve parity. It comes to climax next year soon with the selection process for a new president of the United States.
Prior to that selection there must be developed a rational basis for choosing among the varied dozens that offer themselves to us.
That in turn means the construction among us of a national movement to insist on certain basic themes that must be accepted by a candidate acceptable to us. They would include: 

income and wealth redistribution through a tax structure that reduces the disparity between the needy and the greedy;

11

the elimination of poverty through a program of full employment supplemented by a negative income tax for workers on the margin;
an educational system that dignifies vocational as well as academic training, and permits each American to realize full potential;
free, adequate health care for all Americans, financed through the national treasury and non profit-making insurance companies;
effective social control of monopoly, and
national, regional or municipal ownership of vital services operated for need, and not for profit.

These promise no perfect world, but do hold out the hope that man can create a system of laws and relationships between men that promise more than our present system of privilege for a few.
We ought to be reminded of some words from Dr. W. E. B. DuBois nearly half a century ago:
""We are American Negroes. It is beside the point to ask whether we form a real race. Biologically we are mingled of all conceivable elements, but race is psychology, not biology, and psychologically we are a unified race with one history, one red memory, one revolt. It is not ours to argue whether we will be segregated or whether we ought to be a caste. We are segregated; we are a caste. Our problem is: how far and in what way can we
12
consciously and scientifically guide our future so as to insure our physical survival, our spiritual freedom and our social growth? Either we do this or we die. There is no alternative. If America proposed the murder of our group, its moral descent into imbecility and crime and its utter loss of manhood, self-assertion and courage, the sooner we realize this the better. By that great line of McKay, ""If we must die, let it not be like hogs."" But the alternative of not dying like hogs is not that of dying or killing like snarling dogs. It is rather conquering the world by thought and brain and plan; by expression and organized cultural ideals. Therefore, let us not beat futile wings in impotent frenzy; but carefully plan and guide our segregated life, organize in industry and politics to protect it and expand it. What will be, no one knows. It may be a great physical segregation of the world along the color line; it may be an economic rebirth which insures spiritual and group integrity amid physical diversity. It may be utter annihilation of class and race and color barriers in one ultimate mankind, differentiated by talent, susceptibility and gift--but any of these ends are matters of long centuries and not years. We live in years, swift, flying, transient years. We hold the possible future in our hands, but not by wish and will, only by thought, plan and organization.""*

Now that Boston has become Birmingham and now that American communities who once exported their morality are closing their doors when justice begs to enter, an entire new force h battle for a quality, integrated education has begun. The battle lines are drawn in the following ways.

–At the same time, the United States Supreme Court

began its term this fall with over 40 education cases on its docket – cases involving public and private school discrimination and equal employment issues in lower and higher education in America.
–The President of the United States in his most frightening example of negative leadership has indicated he stands shoulder to shoulder with the slatterns of Boston and the louts of Louisville whose vigilante actions are intended only

to thwart the Constitution and deny Black children an equal, integrated education.

Finally, data released by the office of Civil Rights shows that although Black children are 27 percent of the total school enrollment they constitute 42% of all suspensions. One out of every eight Black secondary school students in America was suspended during the 72-73 school year as compared to one out of every 16 Black student white students.

What is described here then is an education system unable to come to grips with the demand made 21 years ago by the United States Supreme Court to end the maintainance of the dual school system with all deliberate speed. From the days of massive resistance to today, the central theme is this–white Americans do not want their children to go to school with Black children.
To accomplish this goal,

there have has been manufactured the myth of the neighborhood school, the lie lie that school segregation exists because of neighborhood segregation rather than racist school boards, and the fear that bussing somehow damages children’s minds. 
Let me quote at length from an article by Marion Wright Edelman, written for the Harvard Education Review and reprinted in the New York Times. She writes: 
6
[The following is a transcription of the article, included in the manuscript as a photocopy. Underlines seem to be Bond's. Strikethrough is Bond's. Boxes and arrows are also drawn on the article in red pen. See images.]
(From the New York Times, Sept. 23, 1975) LEARNING TO LIVE TOGETHER: MYTHS AND RESISTANCE TO SCHOOL DESEGREGATION (By Marian Wright Edelman) 
CAMBRIDGE, MASS. — Many Northerners seek to justify continued racial segregation in public schools primarily on three grounds: (1) segregation results not from illegal [public] actions or policies but from natural neighborhood patterns — the so-called de jure v. de facto distinction; (2) neighborhood schools are an inviolable American tradition; and (3) school busing endangers children. 
Nowhere are these myths more plentiful than in Boston, where conservatives rail against integration in the name of community and liberal’s wring their hands in confusion, embarrassed that enlightened Boston is making a national spectacle of itself. 
But none of these myths withstands scrutiny. First, the facts in Boston are typical of what judges are finding in other Northern desegregation cases, and they render virtually meaningless the distinction between de facto and de jure segregation. 
United States District Court Judge W. Arthur Garrity Jr. found that Intentional Boston School Committee (school board) actions and policies to segregate black and white youngsters had produced in Boston a school system that is more highly segregated than any other school system in a city, North or South, with the same size and racial composition. 
In a case involving the Denver public schools, the United States Supreme Court held that the segregation in fact is unconstitutional if it is the product of “segregatory intent” of governmental authorities. The Court found that sufficient segregatory intent had been shown in the Denver school board’s “manipulations” of its neighborhood policy to increase the segregation that would have resulted from a truly neutral policy. 
Such segregatory policies or acts can be

manipulations of school or housing patterns. The segregation of American cities is in large part the result of the policies and attitudes of the Federal Housing Administration. Much of the single-family housing that exist today was sold with F.H.A. or Veterans Administration mortgage coverage. 
Since 1935, F.H.A. underwriting manuals have recommended that two principles be followed (1) that racially restrictive covenants shall be honored; (2) that housing in racially integrated neighborhoods shall be rated at less than its fair market price. 
In a study conducted by the F.H.A. in 1939 to guide its housing policies, it was noted that: 
“In a country settled largely by the white race, such members of other races, of course, have not been absorbed . . . It is a mere truism to enunciate that colored people tend to live in segregated districts of American cities. . . . It is in the twilight zone, where members of different races live together, that racial mixtures tend to have a depressing effect upon land values and therefore upon rents.” 
As a result, American families could not move into integrated neighborhoods even if they wanted to, since the F.H.A. thought them bad economic risks. 
Second, the concept of neighborhood schools is not embedded in American educational tradition. Judges have found in numerous cases that the intense commitment to neighborhood schools seems to pale when segregation is possible. 
In the Detroit desegregation case decided by the United States Supreme Court in 1974, all the attendance area changes and options for ten years were examined in the court. Parents in integrated neighborhoods could elect to send their children to either all-white or all-black schools outside their neighborhoods, but not to integrated schools. More than 20,000 individual student transfer requests were reviewed and shown to contain explicit racial motives for white parents seeking nonneighborhood school assignments. All were approved by school officials. 
Neighborhood schools presume neighborhoods exist, and South Boston has been heralded as one of the few remaining coherent communities in Boston. But while it is a “stable” neighborhood as such things go in a contemporary American city, 40 per cent of its 1970 residents have moved there within the preceding five years. 
Even if South Boston were the homogeneous community it is painted to be, maintaining neighborhood schools when they ensured segregated education would not be defensible. As a Federal district judge stated more than ten years ago in ordering desegregation of Fort Worth public schools: “The constitutional right . . . is not to attend a school closest to home, but to attend schools which, near or far, are free of governmentally imposed racial distinctions.” 
Third, unlike neighborhood schools, school busing has a long-distinguished tradition in America. Forty-eight states authorize it and 15 states allow students to be transported to private schools at public expense. In the 1971-72 school year, almost 44 per cent of all American chlidren rode [258,000] buses more than two billion miles — figures that would increase if we counted use of other kinds of public and private transportation to get children to school. But the Department of Health, Education and Welfare estimates that only 3 per cent of the busing has occurred as a result of desegregation. 
Neither the average amount nor the length of busing has greatly increased with school desegregation. In a case involving the desegregation of the Charlotte-Mecklenburg schools, which provoked some of the most virulent antibusing opposition, the record revealed that before desegregation some one way bus trips ran to one hour and 14 minutes. After desegregation, bus rides averaged 30-35 minutes. 
I have often been asked recently about why I support desegregation and school busing when some black parents oppose it. Black parents are no more a monolith than any other parents. And they are human enough to resent having their children continue to bear the disproportionate brunt of achieving desegregation. There is hardly a black adult in this country who does not fight feelings of despair and fatigue daily from endless exposure to white hostility, condescension and plain insensitivity. 
There is not one of us who would will this legacy of misery to our children. But racism is not something you can avoid, even in the confines of Harlem. Racial ignorance and insensitivity are not cured by keeping children apart.* [Asterisk handwritten in red ink. The photocopied article ends here.]

Despite all these lies and the current trauma, most Americans still believe strongly in the public schools.

It is hard for me to imagine an institution in this country that embodies the ethos of democracy more than our system of public education.  
Lawrence Cremin wrote in The Genius of American Education, “Nothing is more striking than the boundless faith of the citizenry in the power of popular education. It was a faith widely shared by the generation that founded the republic, and it has been an essential article of American belief ever since.... education has been... America’s instrument of social progress and reform, and it has commanded such widespread popular support that D. W. Brown was once moved to refer to the public school as America's 'formally unestablished national church’.”  
As public schools began to spread in America early in the nineteenth century, it was the vision of Horace Mann and other early advocates who finally convinced the American people that even those with no children in public schools should be required to pay taxes to support education.  
2 9
They envisioned a common school, open to all, which would be the agent of national development along democratic lines, producing social harmony and equal opportunity, and in time eliminate poverty altogether.  
It was not easy to establish a universal public system. Southern states especially were loath to accept the idea and even then it took private philanthrophy to include Black people even partially in the system.  
But our public education has by now become remarkably inclusive. It is a vast enterprise which employs five million people and spends nearly $50 billion a year. Schools are one of the major public institutions in American life, consuming significant political energy as well as dollars.  
One justification for this huge investment has always been that public schools would produce a more just and equal society based on individual merit. There have always been other goals -- for example, the need for a literate, informed
3 10
citizenry to make democracy possible. But the goal of individual improvement and advancement through education has been a strong article of faith. Succeeding generations of American parents believed ever more strongly that schooling was the key to mobility and succewss for their children.  
The national goal of equal educational opportunity arises from this fundamental faith in the value of public education. In the last few years, however, we have been challenged to question whether our original faith in the social benefits of education has been misplaced.  
Waves of criticism, of course, wash over public education in every generation. But lately the schools are being rocked by a whole series of attacks which seem to undermine further attempts to equalize educational resources for all children.  
Perhaps most astonishing is the proposition from some social scientists that the quality of education itself does not directly influence life opportunity or income distribution. Thoses who believed that more and better schooling would insure mobility and economic success and who perhaps thought that this was the primary justification for public education have been 
4 11
shaken by a number of recent publications.  
Christopher Jencks wrote in 1972 that the goal of social mobility through education may be a myth. 
James Coleman in his better days brought into question the relationship between the amount of money spent and quality of education offered in a report for the U.S. Office of Education in 1966. He examined the situation of poor and minority children in school and concluded that family and social environment evidently weigh more heavily in determining educational achievement than anything the school does, or how many resources it has. Others publications have carried this ""resources and quality"" argument further.  
I maintain that on this issue the reality of many school situations has been obscured. Last year Virginia Fleming wrote in The Cost of Neglect/The Value of Equity, that many southern school districts still spend less than $400 per pupil each year .And It’s hard to pretend that the lack of money is unimportant to quality. When textbooks are ten years
5 12
out of date, libraries are non-existent, choices of what to learn are limited, the cost of school breakfasts and lunches makes them unavailable, teachers are undertrained and underpaid, then the poor quality of education is clearly related to inadequate funds.  
Let me give you an illustration of what I'm talking about. Parents living in the Edgewood neighborhood of San Antonio, Texas, have no choice but to send their children to the poorest public school system in the area. Local school money is raised from the property tax, and in Edgewood the value of property is only $5,960 per pupil. In nearby Alamo Heights the property value is $49,000 per pupil.  
Edgewood Alamo citizens care deeply about education, and are willing (and able, I might add) to pay high taxes for it. On every $1,000 worth of property they own they pay $10.50. Alamo Heights Edgewood citizens, who may also care deeply about education, are simply unable to pay more than $8.50 per $1,000 of property. The results give all the advantages to the children of Alamo Heights Edgewood. The Alamo Heights Edgewood residents raise $333 per student from
6 13
the property tax above their contribution to and returned share of the state funding plan while Edgewood Alamo residents raise only $26 per student.  
According to Fleming, comparison of school district expenditures within each state reveals the same fact: in every state in the union there are tremendous differences in the amount spent on each child. The accident of birth into a rich area or a poor area determines how much will be invested in a child’s education.  
To cite the most flagrant disparity in the South, and perhaps in the nation: in Texas, public expenditures per pupil for the 1969-70 school year were $197 for the lowest district as compared to $11,096 for the highest district.  
For many Americans, the first great disparity in opportunity encountered in life is precisely the institution that is supposed to be ""America's instrument of social progress.""  [The asterisk is crossed out.]
Several years ago, a courageous Texan named Rodriguez filed suit against state and county education officials charging 
7 14
that his children and other children in the Edgewood school district were being denied a fundamental right to Equal Educational Opportunity. The Federal District Court agreed with Rodriguez, and the other parents who joined him. In March, 1973, the United States Supreme Court disagreed. A narrow majority of the justices said the system was doubtless unfair - but it was not unconstitutional. The court decided to leave decisions about change to the state legislatures.  
Officials and legislators in Texas breathed a sigh of relief. They are mostly in agreement that the situation needs improving, but they have not yet come to a political agreement about acceptable change.  
In other states around the country, with and without court cases, school finance is a large political issue.  
It may well be true that, beyond a certain point, the improvement of the learning process depends on many other factors which school money cannot buy. But until all schools get at least to that point, it is cruel to suggest that money does not matter.  
8 15
Or as Coons, Clune and Sugarman said in 1970 in Private Wealth and Public Education, “Whatever it is that money may be thought to contribute to the education of children, that commodity is something highly prized by those who enjoy the greatest measure of it. If money is inadequate to improve education, the residents of poor districts should at least have an equal opprotunity to be disappointed by its failure.”  
Few parents in wealthy suburbs are going to take seriously the notion that they can give up their higher levels of spending without reducing the quality of their children’s education.
Nor should we get trapped in the notion that educators can never change. There is ample evidence that specific school programs can work for low-income children even when families and environment are disadvantaged. Even though some statistical studies may indicate that money has not always been wisely applied, this, obviously, does not have to be the case.  
The question of whether more money really leads to better education is surrounded by another money problem - education already uses up a large share of the nation""s resources. The
9 16
price of public education has tripled since about 1960; the bill still seems to be rising about ten percent a year.  
Part of that stupendous rise in school expense is due to the fact that we are trying to educate more children - both a larger population and larger percent of the population in school longer - but more important causes are higher costs of instructional materials, salaries, fringe benefits, building construction.  
Many taxpayers are not convinced that such increases have produced much improvement in education, and although it is likely that there are some who would be willing to bear larger tax loads if they could see dramatic improvement, the sad truth is that many more are simply concerned about the growing size of the total education bill and its effect on their taxes. This attitude - especially evident outside the South where costs are already high - can be seen in the rejection by voters of school bonds or school tax increases in recent years.  
Serious predictions about the next decade indicate that 
10 17
costs may not keep going up at such a steep rate. Inflation, of course, will doubtless be a devastating problem for some time to come. But enrollments should go down due to the decline in population growth. Teacher shortages, moreover, are pretty much a thing of the past. One can even hope that new attention to efficiency and better school management could help bring costs down. 
Insert X
But, even so, the cost controversy will not disappear. Many proposals to make schools more equal involve raising the total financial investment. Opposition to such proposals can be expected from many and varying quarters.  
It’s apparent that since the beginning of this decade, there has been very little evidence that anyone in public life cared very much about equal educational opportunities for all Americans.  
The biggest educational issue in the country again st is busing. In fact, whenever education is an issue at all, it is from the negative standpoint, against busing, against sex education,
11 18
against student unrest certain books. 
When these issues are used to cloud the real issue of equal education opportunities what are the results? When any list is being drawn of the wrongs in public education, its most visible indices are its effects on the most disadvantaged Americans.  
Added to the increasing rates of school dropouts, suspensions and expulsions - which are much higher among minority group youth than for white youth, is a new phenomenon the “pushout.” The pushout is defined in a study by the Southern Regional Council""s School Desegregation Project and the Robert F. Kennedy Memorial as the student who through discriminatory treatment and arbitrary actions of school authorities is excluded from school, or else is so alienated by the hostility of his or her school environment, leaves school.  
But even those Black youths who stay in school are shortchanged. Although the median years of education for Blacks now nearly equals the median for whites, the quality of education afforded 
12 19
Blacks is much lower. In Equality of Educational Opportunity, Coleman found that the median score for white children on achievement tests was 9.7 points higher than that of Black children in grade one, and 11.1 points higher in grade 12. The schools, one could conclude, are widening rather than lessening disparities.
In order to change this situation, innovative programs, expanded funding which would necessarily include school finance reform, and institutional reform will be required at all levels from preschool through higher education, including adult education.  
Proponents of reform are unlikely to receive a sympathetic hearing in any State House, local school board or in the corridors of the White House unless there is built up in this country a political force powerful enough to make the crisis in and failure of education in America part of the national agenda.  
That is a job for all of us, but particularly for people such as yourselves, people who daily see what schools can do, and don’t; should do, but won’t, and people who see what
13 20
wasted products production line schools can produce.
The crisis has been heightened in recent years by a former president who was the most anti-education president since James Buchanan, who vetoed the original Land Grant College Act in 1860.  
There are no indications that the current administration is any more concerned about lack of opportunities available to disadvantaged Americans.  
The connection between a president and an administration that enforces inequity, inadequacy and racial frustration and fear on an overburdened public school system and an administration that has enforced repression, and curtailment of constitutional guarantees is a simple / one. The one hand wahses the other; the minds which devise preventive detention in the nationz’s capitol have no d sympathy for children detained in overcrowded classrooms in Harlem, in decaying school buildings in Chicago, in the grip of underpaid and overworked teachers, in tiny county school systems too small to adequately provide any educational service.

Let me close by reading yet another statement, this one from Southerners who gathered in New York two w a week recently ago to discuss the fight against inequity in American education. They said then:  
22
[Page 22 is typeset and spaced differently than the other typeset pages. There's a mark that might be a doodle on the right margin.]
The ongoing battle to end segregation and inequality of educational opportunity--in the North as well as the South--will continue. Complete desegregation of our schools is essential to the achievement of freedom and equality in our society. The corrosive effects of racism harm whites as much as blacks and other racial minorities, Northerners as much as Southerners, and the non-poor as much as the poor. The survival of this nation depends upon the achievement of interracial accord and interracial equity in our polictical, economic, and educational institutions. There is encouraging evidence of positive achievement in the area of school desegregation, and this impirical evidence must be brought to the attention of the American public, particularly by the media. It must also be recognized that those federal judges who have acted in consistent accord with the 1954 Brown decision and succeeding cases have in truth upheld and defended the very foundations of our constitutional system. Those Americans of all walks of life who have remained faithful to the ideal of equality will be vindicated by history. Their number, sad to say, does not include the President of the United States and many members of the Congress, whose abandonment of that ideal will also be judged--and found wanting--by history. When all is said and done, one thing remains clear: Separate is not and cannot be equal. Segregation has been tried, and is still being tried, but segregation does not work. We state unequivocally that the choice for America is this: that we achieve desegregation and equality in our society, or else perish as a nation. We commit ourselves to the choice of desegregation and equality.

Sociologist James Coleman’s latest flights of fancy are contradicted both by constitutional necessity and by scientific study. Using twenty of the nation’s largest school districts as his laboratory, he attempted to demonstrate that one fifth of the white parents in half-white half-black schools moved away to avoid court ordered desegregation. If fact, almost no desegregation occurred in the cities he allegedly

Now we face our 200th birthday as an organized people, afraid to look too critically at our past, afraid to assign guilt for present condition or to look too closely at what the future may bring.
And American minorities stand back from each other, looking into history at decades of cooperation between themselves and the majority, but little among and between themselves.
The history of interracial cooperation--whites and Blacks, Browns and whites, Reds and whites--is far from extensive.
It does show, however, that Americans whose skins are white have crossed the lines of color, custom and censure on occasion--however rare--to assist those whose skins are Black or Brown or Red.
These include those whites present at the formation of the Niagra Movement from which grew the NAACP to latter day martyrs Andrew Goodman, Mickey Schwerner and Viola Liuozzo.
But there are increasing signs that the rise in ethic consciousness of the late '60s, begun among Blacks and spreading quickly to become Red Power and even Italian and Irish Power, has driven a wedge between whatever fragile bond tied those of us whose skins weren't white together.
At the same time, the ascendancy of the poverty program in the '60s and its demise in the Nixon years created an unhealthy competition for position, power, and prestige among the darker poor who were its main participants.
Even the recent successful battle to extend the 1965 Voting Rights Act nearly foundered on the competing claims of some Blacks and some Browns.

Now what promises to be continued scarcity threatens any hope for multi-cultural collaboration through the end of the '70s.
If there is any hope for us it is to be found in next year's election when the chance comes to change the name and nature of those who govern us.
There is a potential army to be found among us, an army of voters--Blacks, Browns, Reds and whites--who can make '76 a true celebration of independence.
We can--if we will--forget those differences that separate us and create a coalition of the condemned and the concerned.
This calls for some psychic sacrifices.
We must begin to approach many issues with no apparent racial slant--not every difficulty we face stems from our faces.
Many of our allies must learn that their concerns are not always ours and that we can't be boycotted into supporting them.
All of us must learn where common concern lies--it is at that point that minorities become majorities, and cooperation becomes accomplishment.

The Court then found that to segregate black children, solely because of their race, generates a feeling of inferiority in them that may affect their hearts and minds in a way unlikely to ever be undone, and that legal segregation did the greatest damage in public education and violated the equal protection clause of the 14th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution. The Court's order called for the elimination of legal segregation with all deliberate speed. A fundamental question became to what degree shall segregation be eliminated. Ultimately, the Court has given the resounding answer: ""root and branch."" A second question arose over the meaning of ""all deliberate speed."" After 14 years of litigation that challenged resistance and go-slow schemes, the courts finally answered in the 1968 Green vs. New Kent County, Va. case: desegregate now! Finally, the question of the means to be used to desegregate schools has come center stage and awaits a final resolution in the courts. The issue has received repeated attention by the federal judiciary.
In the ruling in the Swann vs. Charlotte-Mecklenburg case, it was stated that ""magnet schools,"" re-drawing attendance zones, pupil transportation, the closing or re-orienting of certain schools, etc., all are legitimate tools to be used in eradicating dual school systems. The point was to fashion a plan, using the tools at hand, which would truly achieve school desegregation.
The Southern experience over the past decade has finally produced a situation in which more than 50 percent of the region's schools are relatively free of segregation. In many places, too, where resistance once made national headlines similar to those in Boston and Louisville, honest efforts toward desegregation, establishing stability and enhancing educational quality increasingly are
2
the rule. Moreover, today with many Southern leaders accepting full compliance with desegregation efforts, though often grudgingly, even Southern resistors in the education establishment have adopted less visible though nonetheless insidious means of resisting. Now, instead of defying court orders or drawing desegregation plans which had tokenism as their intent, they make subtle use of discipline within schools as a means of forcing black students out.
But the region has obviously not resolved all of its problems related to desegregation. Advocates of equality of opportunity in education wrestle with a whole host of what have come to be called ""second generation desegregation problems,"" and in the urban cities of the South, with problems similar to those of the North. Since explosive tensions such as have surfaced this fall in Boston and Louisville have not erupted this year in the South, Southerners have some reason to view the future with a certain cautious optimism.
That future, however, many Southern educators and desegregation advocates feel, could now be in jeopardy by events taking place outside the South. They are concerned that these events and the reaction of responsible officials to them will re-open old wounds that have been healed only through the most painstaking of efforts. Others, outside the desegregation movement, view the same circumstances as a concrete illustration that while the nation has been willing and anxious to provide equality in the South, it is not so anxious to do so in the North.
But the fact is that the courts have ruled schools must be desegregated -- North and South -- and where deemed feasible the courts have allowed school districts to draw their own plans to achieve this. Many have included pupil transportation (""busing"") because residential and school location patterns were such that to follow existing boundaries would have precluded any meaningful
3
desegregation, which in many cases was the intent behind school lines and residential patterns anyway. Where local systems have developed their own plans, they usually have imposed a heavier burden for the changes necessary upon the shoulders of black communities in terms of which schools were closed, in the form of a steady loss of employment opportunities for black adults, and in the form of black children being transported for greater distances and in greater numbers than white children. In fact, under most plans of whatever origin, the burden for adjusting falls most heavily on blacks. This is the case in Louisville, Ky., where black students, according to the Mayor, will be bused ""for 8 or 9 years out of 12 while whites will be bused for 1 or 2 years."" The usual reason given for this approach, by federal judges, local superintendents and even some attorneys for black children, is the hope that this approach will make desegregation more acceptable to whites.
Today school desegregation, North and South, is intimately intertwined with concerns over the quality of experience children have in public schools, the increasing abandonment of public schools by the growing middle class, concerns over educational content -- its relevancy and accuracy -- concerns over students' academic performance and conduct, concerns as to school finance, concrete concerns over the quality of public education. These concerns are felt at a time when student outlooks, understandings and dreams of the kind of world they want to live in are changing. They are being felt also at a time of widespread rethinking of education goals and purposes by educators. All of these currents combine to affect profoundly the world of elementary and secondary education. They in no small way also affect all facets of organized and formal education. In brief, we are in a time of immense complexity for public education. And we are in a time of crisis for school desegregation.

Resistance to desegregation which has festered beneath the surface in many urban and Northern school districts for years, has emerged full blown in response to stepped up desegregation efforts in these settings. Increasingly, such resistance has been fueled by the strong anti and equivical positions taken by high officials in government, particularly in the Congress, the past and present Secretaries of Health, Education and Welfare and by the past and present Presidents of the United States. Sadly too, this year there has evolved a growing disaffection within the ranks of equal opportunity advocates themselves following the release of the so called ""Coleman Report.""
This was a paper delivered by Dr. James S. Coleman before the annual meeting of the American Educational Research Association in April, 1975. At the time desegregation plans, which included the transportation of students, were before the courts in major cities such as Boston, Detroit, and Louisville. Dr. Coleman's thesis was this: while school segregation decreased greatly between 1968 and 1972, most of the decline could be credited to the desegregation progress in the South. Moreover, Dr. Coleman argued that re-segregation has been occurring in urban school systems because of desegregation attempts that involve the busing of students. He said that such rulings were defeating the purpose of desegregation, because whites in these cities were simply leaving as a result. He described this as ""white flight"" brought about by large scale busing. Despite the fact that in very few of the twenty districts he cited was busing actually required, Dr. Coleman's report has continued to be cited as proof that desegregation ultimately will not work.
Advocates of equal opportunity as well as informed school administrators are well aware of the discrepancies in what Dr. Coleman said his research showed and what it actually showed and they are also aware of the fact that
5
except in rare circumstances, ""white flight"" is most pronounced before large scale desegregation is either ordered by the courts or voluntarily decided upon. They are also mindful of the fact that most high tension resistance to desegregation tends to diminish after two or three years. But they concede that the impact of the Coleman report is detrimental to the desegregation process.
In the fall of 1975, as schools opened, protests in Boston and Louisville mounted, unfortunately aided by President Ford's statements opposing busing. The President said the courts had apparently ignored a 1974 law requiring them to consider other proposals ""before they actually use the busing remedy."" In making this statement, the President was less than accurate, as a careful review of court ordered desegregation plans before and after the passage of the 1974 Elementary and Secondary Education Act (ESEA), would have revealed. In fact, in Boston and Louisville, the two most volatile and publicized communities experiencing civil disorder with the implementation of school desegregation, attorneys for both sides and the judges in both cases carefully considered that portion of ESEA referred to by the President and were somewhat guided by this legislation.
Shortly after the President's statement, however, despite its inaccuracies, the Senate passed legislation designed to further stymie desegregation by prohibiting HEW from threatening aid cutoffs to communities that refuse to transport children beyond the school nearest home (the ""Biden Amendment""). Ironically, this lessening of HEW's enforcement powers comes at a time when HEW is under court order to seek compliance in 17 Southern and border states with Title VI of the 1964 Civil Rights Act (Adams vs. Weinberger). And HEW is presently being sued to seek compliance in the rest of the nation.
Hence, the President's position, the Esch and Biden amendments, though
6
adverse to a wholesome national climate, are probably more symbolic than substantive. Busing is not the issue. Rather, the controversy over busing merely raises the question of the nation's long-range commitment to the principle of equal opportunity in education.
In such a time, we believe that there is a need for reaffirmation of this principle and also for a factually based, calm analysis of events that have created the present crisis, as well as for a reasoned evaluation of what should be the role of education in a democratic society.
From Dr. Coleman's report, and, indeed from many other sources including newspaper stories and editorials, the following hypothetical set of circumstances is widely alleged to exist. As black enrollment increases in schools, a ""tipping point"", (variously estimated at between 30% and 49%) is reached and whites flee to the suburbs or to private schools. In brief, desegregation won't work because it results in white flight. It is also alleged that desegregation has no positive educational value.
There is a singular lack of documented research to support this hypothesis. In fact the most systematic studies in existence refute Dr. Coleman's white flight assertions. One study of eight Florida County school districts shows that over a two-year period (a time of desegregation) only 3.6% of white parents withdrew their children from public schools in favor of private schools.1 The research, conducted under a grant from the National Science Foundation, found no evidence of a precise ""tipping point."" Moreover, busing was found to be unrelated to the parents' decision to remove their children from the public schools.
Another study conducted in 86 Northern school districts shows that school desegregation has little or no effect on white flight as measured by the change
7
in percentage white enrolled in public schools.2 Even in two districts with the highest amount of desegregation that had significant white flight, the percentage was minimal and temporary. White flight, the study shows, stabilizes to a rate lower than the pre-desegregation period by the third year after desegregation in the only two districts that showed any significant change. The report also shows that desegregating under court order does not increase white flight, nor does massive desegregation in large school districts.
On the point of pupil achievement, a recent evaluation of ESAP by the National Opinion Research Center showed:
The effects of school racial composition on achievement were generally small. Both races did less well in schools that were over 70 percent white, and most groups did best in racially mixed schools (41-70 percent white). Fears that white achievement has suffered because of Southern school desegregation appear to be unfounded.
What goes on within a desegregated school has important effects on the achievement of both races. The racial atmosphere is important. Liberal white racial attitudes seem to improve black performance at both grade levels. Racial tension is detrimental to white high school students' achievement. In short, the quality of race relations within desegregated schools is an important concern.

The research we have cited does not refute the fact that whites have, indeed, migrated from central cities to the suburbs, but most such migration had taken place prior to court orders involving busing and, likely would have taken place even if school desegregation were not an issue.
A position in support of equal opportunity in education and support of busing as a legitimate tool to achieve it does not deny the legitimate concerns of parents who have moved to suburbs to find better quality schools and to avoid what has come to be seen as a lack of order and lowering of standards following desegregation. No parent, black or white, affluent or poor, wants
8
their children to attend chaotic and inferior schools. But terms and goals need to be defined. Quality education, busing, discipline, and violence are not used with precision. We believe, at a minimum, that quality education means an educational process that makes learning a happy experience and one that prepares youth for a productive role in society. We believe that it can best be achieved, perhaps, finally can only be really achieved in classrooms that bring together students and educators from all levels of the communities in which they live, that it cannot exist in an atmosphere that separates and divides. Metropolitan school desegregation plans, carefully worked out, could be a useful instrument in this regard.
The desegregation process, because it has brought schools themselves more into the public's attention, has also more sharply revealed to more people the shortcomings of public education. Among other problems frequently cited by parents, teachers, and students are classroom disruption, overcrowded classrooms, the lack of challenge to students to learn, the atmosphere of school as a place of detention, rather than a place for education. What can be done? We are not professional educators ourselves, but we are parents and we have studied the problems of schools for many years. We know there is no magic formula that can bring instant solutions. But there should, it seems to us, be some form of human relations counseling available in at least every high school undergoing desegregation. For there are many and subtle interpersonal attitudes that students themselves are often not emotionally equipped to resolve alone. They should be intimately involved in the process of relieving tensions between groups, but we believe that persons skilled in intergroup relations, committed to equal educational opportunity and to a high quality of public education, should be part of the staff of such schools. Teachers, though many are properly
9
motivated for such a role, lack the time and training for what would, in many circumstances, be full time responsibilities.
There are today, of course, a host of innovative ideas for improving the quality of education and, in fact, many have already been put into use in desegregated situations, if for no other reason than to respond to the complaints of affluent parents over the type education that would be available to their children in a situation where they were transferred from one school to another. These include in-service teacher training, lowered pupil-teacher ratios, the formation of parent-student advisory committees, more instructional aides
We do not believe, either, that parents stated fear of potential violence and racial discrimination in desegregated circumstances can be dismissed as simply racist or overly sensitive rhetoric. They are real, as the findings of Sen. Birch Bayh's committee has disclosed. But precisely because they are real, they must be dealt with in the context of law and good education practices, not avoided out of reluctance to face their reality nor used irresponsibly as ""proof"" of unresolvable racial animosities. Reported acts of violence have increased the past few years. But there is no comparative data between the situation today and five or ten years ago. Disciplinary problems, fights within schools have occurred over generations. What is different now is that such violence is being reported and interracial incidents are the ones that receive publicity. A recent study, however, conducted in Indianapolis schools showed that 80 percent of the violence reported there was intra-racial, which is to say between white and whites, between blacks and blacks. However, media attention in Indianapolis focused on the twenty percent of violence that took place between whites and blacks. Other studies have documented that minorities are dispropirtionately disciplined in desegregated schools.
10
The role of the media in the present day desegregation trauma, in fact, has too often exacerbated, rather than ameliorated tensions. Sometimes it has been irresponsible in its duty for careful reporting of facts, falling into the usage of terms such as ""forced busing"" and ""court ordered busing""; when, in fact, no court has ever ordered busing, per se. Rather, as previously mentioned, the courts have accepted busing as a legitimate tool for desegregation, but only one of many. Usage of the term ""forced busing"" is, in itself, a subjective term, presuming that it occurs in an atmosphere of resistance overcome by overwhelming power, an action lacking the approval of anyone, including the writer of the story, or anyone in the community or, indeed, on the school board which might have approved the plan incorporating it.
The media, of course, is not alone in its lack of regard for clarity or objectivity. Politicians, civic leaders and school administrators are oftentimes equally guilty. But the power of the media to influence public opinion is far greater. We believe that it is failing in its duty for fair and accurate reporting.
The issue of busing is a false issue. What is at stake goes beyond the matter of placing children of one race in schools with children of another. We are talking about equal opportunity in education. We are talking about obeying the law. We are talking about building a democratic society. These are matters that deserve the most serious discussion and decisions about them should not be made in an atmosphere of recrimination or with the desire to make political gain. For we are talking, finally, about children and the kind of nation they themselves will make for future generations. This seems of particular significance, for throughout the present day trauma in Boston the best single hope -- as proved to be the case also in many parts of the South --
11
has been that the attitudes of the students themselves were generally more positive than those of their parents. In this there may be a lesson for all parents North and South, black and white. The world in which they grew up and for which they set the standards is a world that is changing faster than they wish or perhaps can even comprehend. But given support, given encouragement, given a reaffirmation by long-time advocates of equal opportunity, the youth of the seventies may yet be the crucial force in making the long sought for goal of equal opportunity in education a reality.

Seventy years ago, Dr. W. E. B. DuBois set forth the aims of a newly formed mo organization called the Niagra Movement.
It later became the N.A.A.C.P.
He set forth a method and goals as well:
""We must complain. Yes, plain blunt complaint, ceaseless agitation, unfailing exposure of dishonesty and wrong - this is the ancient, unerring way to liberty and we must follow it....""
""Next we propose to work. These are the things that Black men must try to do

to press the matter of stopping the curtailment of our political rights;
to urge Negroes to vote intelligently and effectively;
to pusth the matter of civil rights;
to organize business co-operation;
to build school houses and increase the interest in education.
to bring Negroes and labor unions into mutual understanding
to study Negro history;
to attack crime among us, .... to do all in our power by

2

word or deed to increase the efficiency of our race, the enjoyment of its manhood rights and the performance of its just duties.""

This is a large program. It cannot be realized in a short time .... This is the critical time.""
[The pen changes from blue to black here.]
What was true for Dr. DuBois 70 years ago is sadly true for us today.
The battles that had to be fought nearly 3/4 of a century ago must still be fought now.
We are living in a city where Black political power reigns supreme.
Our congressman is Black.
Two of our county's state senators are Black. A near dozen of our county's state representatives are Black.
Our mayor is Black.
One half of our city
Two of our county commissioners are Black.
Our Mayor is Black.
One half of our City Council is Black.
More than half of our
3
school Board is Black. There is no other city in America in which political power is so firmly held in Black hands, where honestly and firmly and openly Black people pursued a corner of the American Dream and won it.
Now that the initial skirmish in alon a long war is over, the battle has begun.
This is a battle fought on several fronts, for the minds of men, for their pocketbooks, and for their very souls.
We are quickly discovering that the political victory won at the polls was the easiest of all, won with the least effort against the smallest odds.
When Sam Massell defeated the downtown business interests and became Mayor in 1969, he did more that than defeat the might of the Atlanta daily newspapers and the not-too-latent anti-Semitism that runs rampant through the corporate chambers and
4
all white Board rooms of this city; by becoming the first Mayor of Atlanta to win with more Black votes than white votes he broached a wall that had stood solid since the days of Booker T. Washington's Atlanta Compromise Speech, when some Black Southerners traded potential political power for profit in the mercantile world.
The twist of fate that saw Massell oppose Jackson four years later threw many of the dispossessed downtowners into a dilemma - whether to support the Black man or the Jew, the infidel or the heathen.
Jackson triumphed, and the die was cast, the second battle against the second Reconstruction begun.
The leading force was to be the newspapers, the organs of priviledge and special interest.
How did they achieve this power?

[The next three paragraphs are typeset and stapled to the handwritten pages.]
During the late 1930s, Ohio Investor James M. Cox began expanding into the South with his purchase of THE ATLANTA JOURNAL. Not long after, Cox bought out his competitor, the Hearst Chain's ATLANTA GEORGIAN, and simply shut down their presses. In 1952, he bought THE ATLANTA CONSTITUTION, and through the affiliated Cox Broadcasting Company, now owns W. S. B. Television and W. S. B. AM and FM Radio. From its Atlanta headquarters, the Intricate Cox conglomerate now controls twelve newspapers (ten in the South), five television and nine radio stations, plus a sprawling cable TV interest, a technical book publishing company, and a movie production outfit.
This is monopoly at its worst. In brief, one set of elderly white men controls entirely what most of the citizens of Atlanta read, hear, and see. Such a system exists in Russia and China where it is called by its proper names -- dictatorship and thought control. Here we call it free enterprise.

It is no accident that the editor of the morning paper will soon become editor of the Flagship in the Hearst chain - a group of papers described by one critic as ""a naked woman running down the street with her throat cut"" [End of inserted content.]
These This controlled monopoly press has attempted almost daily to destroy any public faith in Black elected officials in Atlanta - through innuendo and character assassination, through deceit and deception they have twisted and turned every attempt made by the Mayor to place Black faces at the table where the goods are handed out.
Through racist caricatures
6
on the screen and in print, we are reduced to Amos and Andy figures, Step-an-Fetchit Fools tap dancing to Dixie played by the press.
In all candor, we must admit that some of us make it easy - too many of us use the sorry excuse that ""white people have been doing this for years; its our turn now.""
It never will be our turn to lie or cheat or steal - having a white Nixon ought not pave the way for Black one.
If having Black faces in high places means anything at all, it must be that our voters expect something different - they expect we who serve them to maintain a standard higher than those whose places we have taken.
Another attack comes from those who would dilute the power we've won after so many years.
Most of the discussion about annexation stems from
7
the displeasure seen across the state with Black men exercising power.
The tradgedy is that Atlanta does need expansion, that this several-county-area has too many governments, and that sober discussion of these issues is clouded by white flight and white fright.
Finally, we are discovering that while political power can be shared when power demands, economic power must be taken.
With the airport contract, the argument is whether 4 Black firms can split $10 million dollars of a $400 million dollar contract - that's right, whether we can have 1/4th of 4.1% of the total cost.
There are indeed people in Atlanta who don't want people who look like us to have 1/4th of 4.1% of tax generated revenues spent on public works.
On the city council, their names are Lambros, Guthman, Fol Fowlkes and Cotsakis.
In the press, their names are JOURNAL and CONSTITUTION. In the city, their names
8
are legion.
Again, we make it easy for ourselves. ourselves to become victim - over 70,000 of us are unregistered to vote here, and therefore unable to choose who represents us where.
We have a tremendous task ahead.
We must succeed.
-30-
We can begin now to set new goals for themselves ourselves.
We must set new goals for those who rule us.
We must begin now to create a world in which priviledge is passed to the many and not reserved for the few, where goods and services are shared by all.
What could such a world provide?
9

income and wealth re-distribution through a tax structure that reduces the disparity between the needy and the greedy;
the elimination of poverty through a program of full employment, supplemented by a negative income tax for workers earning on the margin;
an educational system that dignifies vocational and academic training and allows each person to reach their natural potential;
free health care for every American, sponsored by financed by the national treasury and not by profit making insurance companies;
national, regional or municipal ownership of vital services based on need, not profit.

It is possible to create a new world, but we must begin now.

It is a great pleasure to speak to a group of people who will provide a vital link in the system that delivers health care to us all. 
The service you will perform in neighborhoods abandoned by others, at times when others have taken their money and run to the suburbs, has will make you respected figures in our community. 
You are will be truly advantaged Americans. But I believe, as I am sure many of you do, that these advantages carry with them certain obligations that extend beyond simply using your talents and skills to administer to the health needs of other advantaged Americans. 
We know that poverty, rural residence, environmental conditions and race are powerful barriers to good health. Moreover, the South has a larger percentage of families in poverty, larger percentages of people living in rural areas, larger percentages of people dwelling in housing without adequate plumbing and larger percentages of non-whites than any other section of the country.
2
The South also has higher general and infant mortality rates and fewer health resources. A few statistics highlight the dimensions of the problem.
There are over 10 million poor people living in the region, or 20 percent of the eleven state population. [The following sentence is underlined in red.] Nationally, only 13.7 percent of the total population is poor. 
Twenty percent of the South's population is non-white. The national percentage is 11.1. [The following sentence underlined in red.] Within the region, non-white percentages range from 37.2 in Mississippi to 13.2 percent in Texas. 
In terms of rural residence, all but two Southern states exceed the national average of 26 percent. In four deep South states, over half the people live in rural areas; in five, over a third. 
In nine of the eleven Southern states, the percentage of dwellings lacking some or all plumbing facilities is twice the national average.
3
One other statistic puts the picture in starker perspective. 
Analyzing the latest infant mortality rates from state agencies reveals that if such rates from the South had been equal to the 1971 national average, 2,383 Southern babies would not have died. If Black infant mortality rates in the South had been equal to white infant deaths, 3,408 Black babies would have survived the first year of life.
To point out such statistics is to emphasize the interrelationship between poverty, race, rurality and poor housing in influencing health status. I believe, however, that poverty -- and all that living without an adequate income implies -- to be the single most influential factor affecting health status.
For instance, a national study in 1972 examined infant mortality rates in light of various socio-economic factors, including family income. The report revealed a strong association between the risk of infant death and the lowest socio-economic group. The possibility of such risk ranged from 50 to 100 percent higher in the less advantaged group compared with rates in the
4
middle and upper income groups. Further, the study estimated that almost 50 percent of the infant deaths in the lower socio-economic group were preventable.
But as tragic as such facts are, infants are not the only victims of poverty-related disease. An H. E. W. study entitled Health Characteristics of Low Income Persons published in 1972 revealed that of all persons within the sample having annual incomes below $5,000, 20.9 percent had limitations of activity from chronic conditions, compared with 10.9 percent among the total population.
The availibility and accessibility of health resources also plays an important role in determining health status. If there is any general pattern to the distribution of health professionals, it is that those areas with the gratest needs are the areas with the fewest resources. Nationally, the physician shortage is not so much a problem of supply per se, as of maldistribution, over- specialization and inefficient utilization. But the South's physician/patient ratio is not equal to the national norm. The quality of physician manpower is an issue of regional concern. For the United States as a whole, the physician/patient
5
ratio is 128 patient-care physicians per 100,000 population. In the combined eleven souther states, there are 101 patient-care phsycians per 100,000 people. When states are ranked indiviudally on a national scale, the southern states rank as follows: Alabama, 48th; Arkansas, 47th; FLorida, 16th; Georgia, 36th; Louisiana, 27th; Mississippi, 50th; North Carolina, 38th; South Carolina, 46th; Tennessee, 29th; Texas, 28th; and Virginia, 25th. 
[The following paragraph is underlined in blue.] There are hidden factors in such statistics. Physicians and other health professionals are less available and accessible in rural and inner city areas despite the proportionately greater health needs. The American Medical Association has estimated that rural residents have only about half the access to health resources as is available to the rest of the country. 
And yet the problem goes even beyond maldistribution. Doctors are more specialized today than they were a generation ago. There is a scarcity of primary-care physicians. For instance, in 1931, approximately 75 percent of all physicians were in the primary care fields. In 1967, the figure was 39 percent. 
This fact was highlighted by a report of the A.M.A
6
placement service in 1968, which revealed that out of 2,001 opportunities for primary-care physicians, only 864 physicians sought placement, a deficit of 1,137. Yet 170 opportunities were offered in surgery with 448 physicians seeking opportunities, a surplus of 278. A few statistics from the South illustrate the primary-care need. [The following sentence is underlined in red.] Forty-seven counties in the southern region have no practicing physician at all. But when individual counties that do have physicians are examined in terms of primary care, the figures reveal a still wider health care gap. For example, of 75 Arkansas counties, 58 have no internist, 62 have no pediatrician or obstetric/gynecologist, and 45 no general surgeon. Of Mississippi's 82 counties, 65 have no pediatrician, 59 have no obstetric/gynecologist, 45 no general surgeon. Of Alabama's 67 counties, 41 are without internists, 44 without a pediatrician, 45 without an obstetric/gynecologist and 25 without a general surgeon. 
What are some possible solutions to this health manpower problem? 

Develop and expand training programs for physician extenders. Incentives could be offered to encourage physician 
7
	extenders to locate and practice in medical scarcity areas. Such efforts could be especially beneficial in rural communities unable to attract full-time physician manpower.
Develop comparable licensing procedures for physician extenders, perhaps through delegation of authority by physicians through amendments to state medical practice acts. 
Channel former military medics into physician extender programs while encouraging them to locate in medical scarcity areas. 
Although most federal health manpower training programs operating through medical schools are due to expire, new legislation is presently being considered to replace former programs. When such manpower training legislation is enacted, states should encourage medical schools to take full advantage of those provisions offering financial aid for the training of physician and allied health personnel with incentives for practitioners to locate in medical scarcity areas. 
Develop and/or expand training programs for the primary care fields: some states already offer incentives in the form of partial scholarships which encourage students to choose general
8
	medicine.
Develop and/or expand the number of programs in family practice medicine at medical schools and teaching hospitals. By the way, more than half the nation's medical schools now have or are developing family practice programs with more than 65 percent of these established in the last three years. Although the number of residents in family practice in 1973-74 was six times greater than three years ago, efforts to make family medicine programs competitive with other clinical departments should help toward attracting candidates and thereby aid in correcting the shortage of general physicians. 
Encourage residencies and internships throughout states because of the tendency of physicians to locate in areas where they take advanced training, and encourage team practice location within scarcity areas. 

Recognizing these critical manpower needs, especially in the rural South, I was dismayed to learn recently that practically all Black medical students at the University of Mississippi Medical School receiving financial aid are committed to service with the U.S. military, probably overseas, rather than here at home.
9
Why is it that these students were not made aware of similar financial assistance through the National Health Service Corps which would permit them to practice in a medically undeserved rural area in this country? The answer is simple. The medical needs of poor Southerners -- Black and white -- are not being recognized. 
Moreover, these needs are not reflected in federal programs. For example, Medicaid, ostensibly designed to provide medical services to the poor, has failed to reach the majority of the needy. Program eligibility in all but two Southern states is tied to public assistance eligibility with the result being that in no Southern state are more than a third of families below poverty levels eligible for Medicaid. 
All of which underscores the fact that the nation's health care system makes no attempt to deal with the full range of factors that affect an individual's health. Barriers which I have pointed out -- poverty, rural residence, race, poor envirornment, and the lack of needed manpower and facilities -- are considered beyond the province of the fee-for-service practitioner. Most federal health programs tend to be dominated by provider rather than
10
consumer interests and are little more than half-hearted assaults on a complex, fragmented system. 
Notable exceptions to this rule have been the federally-supported comprehensive health-care centers which stress, in addition to primary health care, such equally important considerations as preventive care, emphasizing outreach, family counseling, food programs and reducing environmentally-related health hazards. 
The Southern Regional Council pointed out in a report entitled, Comprehensive Health Care: A Southern View, that Southern centers have had a solid impact on the health status of people within the target areas. In Lowndes County, Alabama, for instance, the council noted that between 1967 and 1972, when the county was the site of a comprehensive health center, infant mortality rates dropped from 46.9 infant deaths per 1,000 live births to 28.3. In neighboring counties which had to rely on traditional health care delivery systems, rates stayed virtually the same over the five year period, and in some instances were higher. 
The Council also pointed out that some rural centers had taken on the problem of improving water systems in order to prevent the recurrence of diseases -- such as dysentery -- caused
11
by drinking impure water. Such an activity, blocked after June, 1974 by an H.E.W. regulation since it does not come under the agency's definition of primary care, seems of particular significance to the well being of rural people. 
Let me emphasize that while comprehensive centers offer the most promising solution to the health problems of the poor, other programs, more limited in scope, could increase available resources. I have already mentioned the use of physician extenders as a partial answer to the shortage of health professionals. In several Southern states, nurse practitioners and physician associates are currently being used to staff small health clinics in rural communities unable to attract sufficient physician manpower. Although these clinics do not deal with environmental and socio-economically related health problems, they do make needed medical services more accessible and available to rural residents. Mobile units have also been used in a similar fashion as medical treatment facilities that bring health personnel to more isolated rural areas. County health departments, too, might be expanded to provide more personal and environmental health services. Presently such units rarely treat patients and offer only the most limited personal
12
health services, but they do represent a potential health care resource to the community. Whether the financial commitments needed to make them effective providers would be feasible, might at least be explored. 
So far, I've been talking primarily about health care in the rural South. But what about the country as a whole? How does the United States rank with other nations in the world?
A tremor of shock ran through the American health establishment when it was confronted with data revealing that the United States ranked behind thirteen countries in infant mortality rate, behind eleven countries in maternal mortality rate, behind seventeen countries in male life expectancy, and behind ten countries in female life expectancy. Americans do not like to finish less than first in anything. 
Even greater furor has been raised by continual revelations of figures showing shocking rises in the costs of health care, a phenomenon many attribute to poor management of health care institutions and inefficient organization and distribution of health care resources. Americans are traditionally not tolerant of inefficiencies of any kind. But distressing though these rates
13
and figures may be, they are merely symptoms of much broader and deeper problems, human problems, which must be understood in human terms from the point of view of the consumer of health care. For he, the consumer, especially if he is black, must seek his care from alien instituions, which were not truly set up to serve him, and which need not respond to his wants or needs. Visits to doctors or hospitals are, generally, at a place and during hours convienient to them, not him, and those doctors and hospitals would do as well without his patrongage, if he is unhappy with their service. Insurance companies write policies which serve their needs, not his. ANd he is powerless to compalin.Drug companeis develop and manufacture medicines to suit their own purposes and convince doctors to prescribe these medicines by questionable means, leaving him to accept the value of the prescription of faith, hoping it is worth its exhorbitant price, or at least that it will do him no harm.
[Double solid blue lines in the left margin, followed by underlining in blue until page 19.]
This catalog of self-serving institutions and the self-serving brand of care they deliver could go on. But the impact of this system of ""health care"" on Americans of all walks of life can best be seen by examining with some specificity the problems confronting persons seeking health services. Let me undertake
14
a description of some of these problems, drawing on the field of experiences of the Citizens Board of Inquiry into health services for Americans. In one Southern rural community, field workers from the Citizens Board of Inquiry documented all of the following forms of exploitation by local doctors: 

It was a common practice to charge patients a full fee, payable in advance, and then not to perform any services in return, even when services were obviously needed. Instead, the patient would be sent off without a shot or a prescription, left to get better by the will of God or a home remedy, or to die, or to return for another meaningless appointment, or somehow to seek the aid of another doctor whose methods of practice may or may not be different; 
Patients were regularly given unnecessary shots for which an extra fee was always exacted; 
Doctors abused a state-licensed procedure
15
	for the delivery of babies by midwives by only certifying cases as safe for such delivery when the patients could not afford to have their babies delivered by doctor; 
Doctors turned the free drug samples given to them by drug companies' detail men over to local pharmacies for credit on their own accounts, thus depriving patients of a source of free medicine. 

Other forms of exploitation are common in rural areas. In some places, unnecessary operations, including sterilizations, are regular occurences. Tutular doctors often own the local pharmacy or receive kickbacks from the local pharmacist and write prescriptions accordingly. Even without such conflicts of interest, the rural pharmacist is generally able to exploit his own dominant position and charge prices for drugs far above those charged in urban areas. 
Where racial or ethnic minorities are present, another incident of the providers' dominance invariably appears: invidious discrimination in the provisions of health services. Such
16
discrimination may be manifest in longer waits in the outer office, discourteous treatment, inadequate treatment, or the absolute refusal to render services. But its force and impact can perhaps best be understood if we imagine ourselves as a Black mother who must depend for the health of herself and her children on the services of a doctor who is a member of the Klan or a leader of the local White Citizens Council. 
This is not to cloak all rural health providers in the garb of evil. But should a rural doctor be skilled, conscientious, and dedicated, he likely will be called upon to treat sixty, seventy, or eighty patients a day. If he takes an evening or a day off, the residents of his locality may be left without access to medical care. The pressure on the doctor is constant: the time with each patient necessarily short. What kind of care can consumers be getting under these circumstance? The consumer cannot win in our system of rural health care. 
And yet, the rural consumer must pay and pay well for what he gets. The rural doctor defends for his livelihood on the firm establishment of a fee-for-service system. His patients are his payment mechanism, and he must insure the stability of this
17
mechanism by always demanding payment in advance or by a very tight credit policy. Thus, the all too frequent phenomenon of patients in dire need being refused service for lack of cash on hand. Have we not tolerated too long a health care system which condones the turning away of mothers about to give birth because they lack the money to pay the doctor's fee? 
And what of the other pernicious consequences of a health care system which requires financial resources for entry? 
People are paying for medical care instead of food, or instead of clothes necessary to send their kids to school. People are working when they should be resting and recuperating, or are working at jobs detrimental to their health, in order to pay off medical bills. How do we justify a health care system which in fact breeds bad health? 
I have dwelt upon the problems of the rural health consumer because they illustrate in the starkest manner the problems of all health consumers. Urban consumers, both poor and middle class, but especially Blacks, are also the victims of dominant providers, but for them the system is more complex and the dominance more subtle. This system leaves the low income urban consumer at the
18
mercy of providers who locate hospitals and other medical facilities across town from him out of concern for the convenience of doctors or medical students; who set the hours of service at times best suited for the medical staff, though often inconvenient for him; who set as low priorities the improving of the depressing atmosphere of emergency rooms and outpatient clinics, the shortening of the often hours-long wait for outpatient care, the hiring of interpreters for foreign language speaking minorities, and the changing of hospital procedures and staff attitudes which deprive the patients of dignity and privacy; and at the mercy of providers who have established a system of medical education which selects as doctors those with the least understanding of and empathy for the lives and feelings of the urban poor. 
This system leaves the urban middle class consumer at the mercy of insurance companies which decide it is not worth their while to police hospital and physician costs and so provide him ever decreasing coverage for ever increasing premiums, and at the mercy of insurance plans which force him into the hospital, causing him to lose income, for care which he could receive on an outpatient basis. 
I have made no attempt to deal exhaustively with the entire
19
range of consumer health care problems. Rather, I have tried to stress the link, increasingly apparent to consumers and consumer groups, between consumer problems and the inability of consumers to protect themselves within the present system. [Double underlining starts here.] Despite all the money and manpower this country pours into its ""health care system,"" the output of that system, as far as the consumer is concerned, is both meager and oppressive. He has trouble getting care when he needs it. The care he does get is all too likely to be inadequate, and he has no way of judging its adequacy; and yet he must pay dearly for whatever he gets. This indeed is [Blue underlining starts here.] A health care system in crisis. But I submit that the crisis is not one of inefficiency. Health institutions are working only too well in the service of their own interests. There is only inefficiency if we mistakenly assume that the ultimate object of these institutions is to deliver good health. In fact, the health care that is delivered is but a byproduct of the system.
[Double underlining starts here.] I am also We must be disturbed by some of the proposals for a national health insurance scheme which seem resigned to simply pouring more money into the present malfunctioning system and hoping this money will trickle down in the form of increased benefits for consumers.
20
There is one natioanl health plan that differs substantially from the rest. That is the one that has been introduced by U.S. Representative Ron Dellums and endorsed by the Congressional Black Caucus. Six principles from his proposed legislation that have paramount important are: 

Complete, accessible community based health care for all with no charge for services; 
Financing through fully progressive taxes; 
Elimination of profit making; 
No restrictions on eligibility on benefits; 
Control and review of quality by the health professionals as well as community review, and 
Strict control over quality price and distribution of all drugs. 

No more basic reform is needed than that the health care system devote its energies solely to implementing the right of decent health care for all. Reform of this nature can not and should not come from within the present health establishment.
If health care is truly to be a right, the interests of the consumer must be over-riding in the system, and health care institutions must be structured to respond to those interests. 
You men and women are expected to be, and are supposed to be, different from the horrible example I have described. Because you come from, and will will practice in, communities where healthy care has always been measured out in tablespoons by the powerful and affluent, you have been especially sensitive to the problems I have described. 
But you have an additional responsibility. You will shortly will shortly represent one of the most affluent groups of Black people in the United States. You are respected and looked up to in your communities. You must use this affluence to help support those institutions that will make our community a more viable place to live. You must speak out against our common enemies, and speak in favor of our common goals. 
You must use your influence to build a stronger feeling of race consciousness in our communities, a consciousness that cannot help but help you. Each of you is familiar with the sorry feeling of too many Black people that the white man's ice is colder,
22
his sugar sweeter, and his medicine stronger. You, as others, must face up to the demands that spring from the Black community. 
Let me leave you with a selection from two a speeches delivered long ago by a Black man of medicine, a strong man with a tongue as sharp as his scalpel. His name was Dr. John S. Rock, and what he had to say over one hundred years ago still has a great deal to say to us in 19756: if you can make your action match his rhetoric, then Black people's health care problems will be closer to solution.
[The following quote is highlighted with a red line in the left margin.]
 I am here not so much as to make a speech but to add color to this occasion..... the situation of the Black man in this country is far from being an enviable one. Today, our heads are in the lion's mouth, and we must get them out the best way we can. It is probably that if we had the malice of the Anglo-Saxon, we would watch our first chance and seize an opportunity to take our revenge.
The educated and wealthy class of white people despise the Negro, because they have robbed him
23
of his earnings, or at least have gotten rich off the fruits of his labor.... The lowest class hate him because he is poor, as they are...
I do not regard this as a time of darkness. The war that has been waged against us for two centuries has opened our eyes, and caused us to form alliances, so that instead of acting on the defensive, we are ready to attack the enemy. This is simply a change of tactics, but I think I see the work of God in all this. Yes, there is the handwriting on the wall: I come not to bring peace, but a sword. Break every yoke and let the oppressed go free. I have heard the groans of my people, and am come down to deliver them....
White Americans have taken great pains to prove that we are cowards. We are often insulted with the assertion that if we had the courage of Indians or white men, we should never have submitted to be slaves.
24
The courage of the Anglo-Saxon is best shown in his treatment of the Negro. A score of them will pounce on a Negro, tie him up, beat him, and call him a coward because he resists. Many of their most brilliant victories have been achieved in this manner. But the greatest battles they have fought have been on paper. White men have no room to taunt us with tamely submitting. If they were Black men, they say, they would work wonders, but as white men, they can do nothing. Consistency, thou art a jewel.
I would have you understand that I not only love my race, but I love my color, and while many colored persons may feel degraded by being called Negroes, I shall feel it my duty, my pleasure and my pride to concentrate my feeble efforts in elevating to a fair position this race to which I am especially tied by feeling and by blood.
The prejudice which some white men have against
25
my color gives me no pain. If any man does not fancy my color, that is his business, and I shall not meddle with it. I shall give myself no trouble because he lacks good taste. I will not deny that I do admire the talent and character of many white men, but I cannot say I am particularly pleased with their physical appearance. If old Mother Nature had held out as well as she began, we should probably have had fewer varieties among the races.
When I contrast the fine, tough, muscular system; the beautiful rich color; the full broad features, the lank hair and delicate physical condition of the Caucasian, I am inclined to believe that when the white man was created, Mother Nature was pretty well exhausted, but determined to keep up appearances, she pinched up his features and did the best she could under the circumstances."

I have been told--not just told but enjoined--by the Mistress of Ceremonies to limit my remarks to fifteen minutes or less; by the sponsors of the evening not to talk about the honoree, by my friends from New York not to make cheap jokes at this expensive city's expense.
And so, because with Richard Hatcher and Ken gGibson I am one of the small corps of urban American blacks elected officials, let me spend my time talking about our common political state.
We stand now on the eve of our 200th anniversary as an organized people--afraid to look too critically at our past, afraid of what the future may bring, afraid to assign guilt and responsibility for our common condition.
The nation's birthday celebration coincides with a national retreat from the original promise that life, liberty and happiness's pursuit would be guaranteed to all.

Instead we face the collapse of America's greatest city, the disappearance of moral conviction and social concern, the abdication of leadership and the elimination of conscience.
We have ended a period of national concern about the unfortunate and underprivileged--selfishness has replaced selflessness as our code of behavior.
Through this 200-year period has run a single thread--the hopes and aspirations of black people to share in the nation's abundance.
Like a cork in a tub, these dreams have bobbed up and down--now the natural buoyancy is threatened and the possibility exists that we--like New York--may soon go under, betrayed by our former allies and abandoned by our old friends.

As the locale of the struggle by black people for educational and political and economic equality has shifted from Birmingham to Boston, and as the classic struggles of the sixties in the South delivered civil rights whose implementation would yield to thought and plan rather than moral suasion and mass protest, a peculiar kind of quiet descended upon us.
At the same time, those in this region who had rejoiced at the swift crushing of Southern white mobs and who had laughed at the crudities of Bull Connor's minions discovered nobility in the foul mouths of South Boston harridans and class consciousness in the minds of louts in Louisville who burn buses and spit on schoolchildren.

The rationalization that allowed the relatively speedy observation of the principles of law and order in the backward South and yet denied it in the urban North was coupled with a decrease in the political power of the growing black masses above the Mason-Dixon line.
Some years ago, we in the nether regions of America who had benefited for so many years from the kindness of Northerners who gave their money and their selves to tear the fabric of American apartheid in the old Confederacy attempted to return the favor by sending a corps of young Southerners--white and black--to minister to the political aspirations of blacks in this city, the offer was rudely refused by political leaders and foundation sources alike. It is, then, no accident that there are proportionally more black people registered to vote in Selma than there are in Brooklyn.
That malaise is but one sign of a leaderless nation.

A Presidential campaign approaches and no candidate--no, not one--includes racial justice among the points in his platform, especially if it is to be achieved at any higher cost.
The members of a new Congress came to power in January, fresh and feisty and ravenous as wolves--yet time and time again they have demonstrated that they lack the testicular fortitude to override the vicious vetoes of a President with no demonstrated national constituency at all.
It is as though the land of juleps and jasmine has inverted itself and said to the rest of America: Be patient, don't make our mistakes, don't allow movement or conscience to beat you down. Resist--the nation will one day no longer insist that you measure up to the minimal standards we have met, and the fighters for freedom will grow weary.

And the nation has agreed, has acquiesced in surrendering to its underside, the hidden world of hatred and bias that always lurked just beneath the surface.
The worldwide economic crisis has increased our insulation and made the question ""who will pay"" foremost in our minds.
We must find some way to seize the initiative, to force the problems of the poor and black once more on the national agenda.
If nothing more, let us take note of the names of those in Congress who have demonstrated their inability to understand and carry out the Constitution. Let us mark now the names of those throughout our public life who have surrendered the ability to lead.
Let us not have a Ford in our future, lest he drive us further backward from our national promise.

Let us be reminded that the 21 years since the Brown v. Board of Education decision, the short years since Montgomery, the few years since we marched from Selma represent only moments in a long day.
What we need is the ability to persevere, to carry on, to march forward despite the risk.
No one can doubt that we all must learn to do with less in the years ahead. Why not begin a frontal assault on racial arrogance and privilege,and on the inequitable distribution of our resources to a few at the expense of the many.
No better Bicentennial gift might be offered than the ending of two centuries of racial hate and cultural isolation, of economic injustice and maldistribution of our wealth.
We cannot achieve such goals through any relaxation of our vigilance.

Our choice is made, and we must act on it.
We who came through the short period of struggle in the South have a tendency toward arrogance, it is true.
Our cities are healthy, in a relative way, our schools, desegregated, in a relative way, our people vote well and wisely, in a relative way.
We passed you by, sometime between the day when we wanted what you had and today,when we want to avoid what you've got.
Let us together seek to build a new world in which we can discriminate, if at all, by character--and not by color or class.
Let us overcome again and again, until we can rest and say: Well done.

DuBois set forth the aims of a newly formed organization called the Niagara movement. It later evolved into the N.A.A.C.P. He set forth a method and goals as well:
We must complain. Yes, plain, blunt complaint, ceaseless agitation, unfailing exposure of dishonesty and wrong -- this is the ancient, unerring way to liberty, and we must follow it....
Next, we propose to work. These are the things that Black men must try to do:

to press the matter for stopping the curtailment of our political rights;
to urge Negroes to vote intelligently and effectively;
to push the matter of civil rights;
to organize business co-operation;
to build houses and increase the interest in education;

2

to bring Negroes and labor unions into mutual understanding;
to study Negro history;
to attack crime among us, .... to do all in our power by word and deed to increase the efficiency of our race, the enjoyment of its manhood rights, and the performance of its just duties.

This is a large program. It cannot be realized in a short time.... This is the critical time.

What was true for Dr. DuBois 71 years ago is sadly true for us today.
The battles that had to be fought nearly 3/4 of a century ago must still be fought now.
We stand now on the occasion of our two hundredth birthday as an organized people, afraid of what the future may bring, afraid to look too critically at our past, afraid to assign guilt and responsibility for our common condition.
On July 4th, 1776, the people of the thirteen colonies
3
declared that the economic slavery imposed upon them by British colonialism denied their right to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.
The first American revolution had begun.
From its beginnings, it automatically excluded great sections of the population from the democratic vision of what the United States of America could be. It excluded all women. It excluded native Americans, whose land was stolen, whose people were slaughtered, and whose rights were trampled; African people, kidnapped from their homelands and brought to this country as slaves, their families destroyed, their labor exploited, their humanity denied, their religion suppressed.
Now two hundred years have gone by; years of struggle punctuated by civil war and non-violent movement.
The original 13 colonies have turned into a great Collossus, a power which threatens its own citizens with intolerable economic hardships, social disintegration and a denial of political rights.
While most of the nation prepares to parade and celebrate its anniversary, an American underclass waits for its own
4
Declaration of Independence to be declared.
Our struggle heightened over the past sixty-plus years, years of legal struggle in the courts which were followed by other struggles in the streets.
Gains were won at lunch counters and movie theatres and polling places and bus stations, and the fabric of legal apartheid in America began to be destroyed. What had been a movement for civil rights has become a political movement. And Black men and women are winning office and power only dreamed of before.
But despite an increase of 150% in the number of Blacks holding office, despite the ability to sit or eat or ride or vote in places that formerly lacked Black faces, in a real way we find our condition unchanged.
A quick look at every statistic that measures how well or poorly a group of people is doing -- infant mortality rates, median family income, life expectancy -- shows that while our general condition has improved, our relative condition has actually worsened.
It is almost as though we were climbing a molasses mountain
5
dressed in snowshoes, while everyone else rides a rather leisurely ski-lift to the top. Now the ski slopes are more treacherous, and the molasses melting into mud, a Sargasso Sea of crime in high places, of joblessness for many and hopelessness for many more.
Yesterday's gains become suspect. The bus front seat loses meaning for a people whose longest trip is likely to be from the feudal system of the rural South to the more mechanized, high-rise poverty of the North.
The right to vote loses meaning for a people forced to choose between Tweedledum and Tweedledee.
The right to an integrated education can mean little to children bused from one ignorant academy to another.
The struggles of the sixties were carried forward against discrimination in housing, employment, education and government, both because the victims became their own best champions and because they found a sympathetic ear in the national body politic.
But as the demands became more strident, as a foreign war drained treasury and manhood, as our best and brightest were beaten down by bullets, a shift occurred in the national
6
consciousness.
For Black Americans, our political hopes and aspirations have passed through two reconstruction periods. Each one ended with the surrender of national responsibility for the plight of Black people to the individual states of the South, or a laissez-faire benevolence that is doomed to condemn us to perpetual half-citizenship.
The second reconstruction, the heady period following the historic may 17th Supreme Court decision, included the re-birth of Black activism with the Montgomery bus boycott of 1956, the 1960 sit-ins, the 1964 Civil Rights Act, and the 1965 Voting Rights Act, when Black Americans began to believe that freedom, like the end of the war in Vietnam, was ""just around the corner.""
All those beginnings began to end in 1968, but not simply because one man and one party won the presidency and another was defeated. The circumstances of death for the second reconstruction were many and complex, but deeply rooted in the American notion that once re-granted the already constitutionally guaranteed right to vote, Black Americans had been ""given enough!"" A not unrelated, if unspoken, decision was made in the same quarters about the American poor.
7
Through the sixties, as the Black movement struggled into politics, escalated into protest, and culminated in unfocused rebellion, one thing has been constant. This is the belief held by the overwhelming majority of Black Americans that the political process is one -- not necessarily the best or only one -- of several problem-solving devices open to us.
Despite decades of protest and movement, despite election, agitation and resignation, what has occurred over the last half-decade is simple -- the reins of government have been seized by a massive coalition of the comfortable, the callous and the smug, who've closed their hearts and minds to the claims and calls to conscience put forward by the forgotten and unrepresented elements in American society. This has resulted in the national nullification of the needs of the needy, the gratuitous gratification of the gross and the greedy, a triumph for the politics of penuriousness, prevarication and impropriety, of pious platitudes and self-righteous swinishness.
The two most recent national presidential elections gave this group awesome power -- the second, more a rout than an election, a rout that reinstalled the fiscal facists, the merciless merchants of the cost accounting schools of social
8
welfarism in the White House, and insured a four-year reign for men with an arrogant contempt for people and their problems.
The late American balladeer, Woody Guthrie, once said that some men kill with bullets; others kill with the stroke of a pen.
The frightening governmental results of the last half-decade, fostered by an impotent Congress, unable to resist presidential vetoes, impoundments, cut-backs, shifts in sharing and reverses in revenue have cut sharpest at the people on the bottom, those who traditionally look to their government for some help.
For a time, a portion of that trend appeared to be reversing itself. The normally moribund Congress, wet by Watergate and splashes from the tidal basin, embarassed by the sight of one of their own ogling bare breasts in Boston, moved with some swiftness to topple a series of octogenarians made strong by the senility system and advanced the democratic process slightly by opening their own processes to fuller participation.
But in spite of rising prices and unemployment, in spite of increased inflation and dangers of recession,
9
these same men and women lack the testicular fortitude to offer any alternative to President Ford's program of promoting austerity by making the poor pay more for food stamps and gas, and by refusing a decent raise in Social Security.
But if the years before, the Kennedy and the Johnson years, taught us any kind of lesson at all, it ought to have been that government, under militant and concerted pressure, would move, slowly and rather ponderously, all too often with all deliberate lack of speed, to become a limited partner of sorts with the American underclass in their struggle to do better for themselves.
The last few years have changed all that. The government's policy toward the poor has changed from benign concern to malignant neglect.
In the decade of the sixties, the number of people living in poverty in America was reduced by nearly one third. It's not at all unreasonable to ascribe some of these gains to the Great Society and New Frontier programs of that era. Yet despite these victories, the cruel and callous castrators moved with cold calculation to kill, freeze, and wind down urban renewal,
10
model cities, community action, public service employment, student loans, public housing, federal impact funds for education, and to impose a sixty-percent national pullback in social services.
If we are to believe with Thomas Jefferson that the common man is ""the most precious portion of the state,"" we find that precious resource in real danger of economic extinction today.
Human problems are now placed on a balance sheet, forced to add up, to pay for themselves.
While the nation waltzed into the seventies believing that its ""Black problem"" had either been burned or blown away, infant mortality rates for us remained twice as high as for everyone else, nearly half of all Black families in the United States earned less than $5,000 a year, the average Black American male was still dying seven years earlier than his white counterpart, we remained the last to be hired and the first to be fired.
We are where we are today because of a confluence of events of the 1960's. The non-violent -- and in retrospect, lovable -- marchers of the first part of that decade began to be replaced, if not in fact, then certainly in the public fancy,
11
by the rapacious rioters of the latter part of the sixties. America's major cities were believed to be either in flames, under martial law, or sinking under the dead weight of a population of pensioners, the unemployed young, or their presumably unemployable parents.
The middle mind of America was running away from social concerns in a crisis all their own. They rightly perceived that their taxes -- higher proportionately than those paid by their pernicious president of the past -- were escalating to pay for barely maintaining what they were running away from, but they were wrongly taught, by their president and others, that their taxes were high because of the lazy poor, and not because of the corporate evader and military glutton.
The rhetoric from Washington about sharing the wealth became a scandalous exercise in consolidating wealth and power where they always were, away from the cities, away from the children, away from people for whom wealth is an extra meal and for whom power is the ability to hide from the census taker.
The often repeated connection between today's dilemma
12
and the end of the Reconstruction era 100 years ago is more than frightening.
Then and now, a president desperate for power entered into an illicit arrangement, not just with the unreconstructed South, but with the national unreconstructed mentality that believed then -- as it believes now -- that private profit and public arrogance could be pursued at the expense of the people living on the American margin.
Concurrently, many of the formerly liberal crusaders for social justice and democracy became tired, or involved in other, less traumatic concerns.
For many of them, picking up beer cans by the side of the public highway became an acceptable substitute to winning jobs in the brewery for Black people.
The aspirations of, and movement by Black people began to be curtailed, not by organized violence and barbarity, but by a series of nationally choreographed legal and extra-legal manuevers designed to make us less than political and economic equals.
The frenetic -- and often frantic -- activity of the
13
1960's had created a political climate characterized by selfishness and fear; a political constituency was recruited from the frightened to form solid ranks against the forgotten.
Backlash is too hackneyed a term for a people confused by long hair and frightened by clenched fists, their politics misdirected by those who verbally oppose crime in the streets but secretly practice crime in the suites. This manipulation of the American mind has made the mundane magnificent, and placed government in the hands of men who believe in privilege for the powerful and neglect of the powerless.
There can be no better prescription for relieving this crisis, and for reviving some interest in it, than by re-creating a non-partisan national coalition of need, with us as base, of parents who want care, not warehousing for their children, of workers who want work at a decent and protected wage, of people who work for their living and can't live on what they make, as well as those who can't find work but can't live on what we so grudgingly give, of all those people who want an end to welfare and capitalism for the poor, and subsidy and socialism for the wealthy, and all those who
14
must learn that sufficiency for those at the bottom is compatible with stability for those in the middle ... All those people now live in America, divided now by race and class, fearful of each other, contentious and impotent.
An entire political movement came to near maturity in America in the sixties. Fueled by the fire from the Southern civil rights and national anti-war movements, it threatened to challenge the foundations of the racial and economic arrogance that has created vast reservations of the unwanted on this country's soil.
That movement became the partial victim of its own success. It fought for and won the right to sit in front of the bus, to cast a vote, to sit at a lunch counter. It launched a Southern Black political movement, but it failed to sustain and extend itself, and instead saw itself dissipated by struggles on the edge.
For some of us, being Black became a rhetorical or sartorial accomplishment.
For many, social commitment began to be measured by the length of your hair, or the intricacy of your handshake.
15
Today's counterparts of the young people who some years ago marched with us militantly in the streets are now found running nude on the college grounds, attempting to prove perhaps that all men are not created equal.
The political process needs to be put to a constant test, not as an election day effort alone, but as another weapon in an arsenal that has always contained more pop guns than howitzers.
Let us beware of those who use the master-race theories of ""alien groups"" and ""ethnic purity.""
After all, we arrived in this country the year before the Mayflower did and hardly constitute an alien group.
More than ever now, when some Americans think a proper bi-centennial celebration is to beat a Black man in Boston with an American flag, we must redouble our efforts to win our place in the American political scene.
What is frightening to consider -- in the summer of 1976 -- is that once again the nation is choosing a president, and we are less prepared than ever to participate in that choice.
The facts are real ones. While Black people in the
16
Southern region have an admirable record of political performance, nationally we are in real danger of counting ourselves out of helping choose who will govern us over the next four years.
In 1960, in a close election between John F. Kennedy and Richard Nixon, 39 million eligible Americans, Black and white, failed to vote.
In 1964, when Lyndon Johnson defeated Barry Goldwater in a landslide election, 43 million Americans chose not to choose.
In 1968, the figure rose to 47 million, and in 1972, 63 million Americans stayed at home and let the rest of us choose between Richard Nixon and George McGovern.
More frightening for us in 1972 was this: fewer than one-half of the 14 million Blacks who could have voted in that election were even registered to vote. 
For many of us, it was a point of pride to recall that no Black person -- except the security guard who discovered the break-in -- was involved at all in the entire scandal that grew to be called the Watergate affair. 
17
For some of us, this was an indication that the Nixon administration was so racist that they didn't even want to grant us equality in crime. For myself, I sadly know too many brothers who would have cut John Dean's throat if they could have taken his place at Nixon's right hand.
The point here is that Black Americans had it in their power years earlier to have prevented the entire scandal, to have erased this sorry episode from our country's history.
In 1968, had we voted an additional ten more Black voters per Black precinct across the United States:

Richard Nixon would not have been elected President of the United States;
Berger, Blackmon, Powell and Rhenquist would not be on the United States Supreme Court;
Spiro Agnew might either still be the governor of Maryland or serving time;
John Mitchell would never have been Attorney General;
John Dean and Charles Colson would be practicing

18
law in obscurity;

the world would have never known -- or cared -- who Martha Mitchell was;
and Gerald Ford would not now be the President of United States.

Without attempting to shoulder all of the blame for the last eight years of conservative rule, we must share some of the responsibility, for in spite of restrictive law and social custom, in spite of shifts to the right among other sectors of the old Roosevelt coalition we belonged to, it is an undeniable fact -- Black non-voters opened wide the door for the Nixon years in 1968, as surely as if we had carried him into office on our backs. And on our backs he surely was!
Four years later, with less chance for success, our behavior was the same, and worse.
Now, despite a generally good record among Southern Blacks, the Voter Education Project estimates that a 12 to 15% point gap exists between Black and white voter registration in the eleven Southern states.
19
Nationally, the picture is worse. Proportionately, there are now more Black people registered to vote in Selma, Alabama, than there are in Brooklyn, or Chicago, or Detroit, or Philadelphia.
In 1976, regardless of which candidates ultimately come before us in November, the patterns of the poor participation in the past are likely to be repeated.
It provides little profit to discuss today why this is true if the discussion is limited to criticisms of the choices we may have then.
The point is that having little to do with the selection of the runners-up, we will be in poor position to blame the winners.
Critiques of the American political and economic system exist in great abundance, and need not be repeated here. To debate whether or not we ought to be in the ""system"" is like telling a drowning man he shouldn't be in the water. He is, and so are we. We had better learn how to swim or build boats, and the water is rising every day.
The debate about whether or not we ought to participate
20
in the bi-centennial celebration is an artificial one, too. This country wouldn't have made the first 100 years without our toil and talent, and it cannot continue for another 200 if it ignores the resource we have to offer.
We do the country -- and importantly ourselves -- a great dis-service when we voluntarily stand back from the great decisions being made around us.
Let us remind ourselves of some other words from Dr. DuBois spoken nearly half a century ago:
We are American Negroes. It is beside the point to ask whether we form a real race. Biologically, we are mingled of all conceivable elements, but race is psychology, not biology, and psychologically, we are a unified race with one history, one red memory, one revolt. It is not ours to argue whether we will be segregated, or whether we ought to be a caste. We are segregated; we are a caste. Our problem is: how far, and in what way, can we consciously and scientifically guide our future so as to insure our physical survival, our spiritual freedom,

21
and our social growth? Either we do this, or we die. There is no alternative. If America proposes the murder of our group, its moral descent into imbecility and crime and its utter loss of manhood, self-assertion and courage, the sooner we realize this, the better. By that great line of McKay, 'If we must die, let it not be like hogs.' But the alternative of not dying like hogs is not that of dying or killing like snarling dogs. It is rather conquering the world by thought and brain and plan; by expression and organized cultural ideals. Therefore, let us not beat futile wings in impotent frenzy, but carefully plan and guide our segregated life, organize in industry and politics to protect it and expand it. What will be, no one knows. It may be a great physical segregation of the world along the color line; it may be an economic rebirth which insures spiritual and group integrity and physical diversity. It may be utter annihilation of

22
class and race and color barriers in one ultimate mankind, differentiated by talent, susceptibility and gift -- but any of these ends are matters of long centuries and not years. We live in years, swift, flying, transient years. We hold the possible future in our hands, but not by wish and will, only by thought, plan and organization.*"

@copyright, Julian Bond, 1975
We are now a few weeks into 1975. The celebration of our birth as a nation is only a few months away.
We have a fairly new President, elected by a majority of one, who in turn has chosen a new Vice-President. We find ourselves in a time of international turmoil and domestic dillemma, of national indecision about the ways and means to stop rising prices and falling expectations. Across the rest of the world, rather swift changes are taking place.
In Africa, the people of Mozambique and Guinea-Bissau are reaching have reached freedom and self-determination. The North Vietnamese are consolidating their earlier victory over American military might and will soon exercise control over their entire nation.
In Eurpoeope, in Latin America - with some notable exceptions - the struggle for justice and right against oppression and wrong goes on.
Only in America is there hesitation and faltering, uncertainty and indecision. Only here do popular movements against among the oppressed rise and fall as regularly as the phases of the moon.
3
The last two-and-one half decades of Black struggle in American life have produced some marvelous victories, often overlooked today as unemployment increases and the economic system nears chaos.
Gains were won at lunch counters and movie theaters and polling places and bus stations and the fabric of legal apartheid in America was destroyed. What had been a movement for civil rights has become a political movement, and Black men and women won are winning office and power only dreamed of before.
2 4
But despite an increase of 150% in the number of Blacks holding office, despite the ability to sit or eat or ride or vote in places that formerly lacked Black faces, in a real way we find our condition unchanged.
A quick look at every statistic that measures how well or poorly a group of people is doing--infant mortality rates, median family income, life expectancy--shows that while our general condition has improved, our relative condition has actually worsened.
It is almost as though we were climbing a molasses mountain dressed in snowshoes, while everyone else rides a rather leisurely ski-lift to the top. Now the ski slopes are more treacherous, and the molasses melting into mud, a Sargasseo Sea of crime in high places, of joblessness for many and hopelessness for more.
Yesterday's gains become suspect. The bus front seat loses meaning for a people whose longest trip is likely to be from the feudal system of the rural South to the mechanized, high-rise poverty of the North.
The right to vote loses meaning for a people forced to choose between Tweedledum and Tweedledee.
The right to an integrated education can mean little to children bussed from one ignorant academy to another.
The struggles of the sixties were carried forward against discrimination in housing, employment, education and government, both
3 5
because the victims became their own best champions and because they found a sympathetic ear in the body politic.
But as the demands became more strident, as a foreign war drained treasury and manhood, as the best and brightest were beaten down by bullets, a shift occurred in the national consciousness.
2 6
attach economic arguments to the standard demands for racial and political justice.
Despite protest and movement, despite election , agitation and resignation, what has occurred over the last half-decade is simple- the reigns of government have been seized by a massive coalition of the comfortable, the callous and the smug, who've closed their hearts and their minds to the claims and calls to conscience put forward by the forgotten and unrepresented elements in American society. 
This has resulted in the national nullification of the needs of the needy, the gratituitous gratification of the gross and the greedy, a triumph for the politics of penuriousness, prevarication and impropriety, of pious platitudes and self-righteous swinishness. 
The two most recent national Presidential elections gave this group awesome power, the second more a rout than an election, a rout that reinstalled the fiscal facists, the merciless merchants of the cost accounting school of social welfarism in the White House, and insured a four year reign for men with an arrogant contempt for people and their problems. 
The late American baladeer Woody Guthrie once said that some men kill with bullets: others kills with the stroke of a pen. 
The near genocidal results of the last half decade, fostered by an impotent Congress, unable to resist Presidential vetoes, impoundments, cut-backs, shifts in sharing and reverses in revenue have cut sharpest at the people on the bottom,
3 7
those who traditionally look to their government for some help. 
Now For a time, a portion of that trend appears appeared to be reversing itself. The normally moribund Congress, wet by Watergate and splashes from the tidal basin, made bold by the sight of one of their own ogleing bare breasts in Boston, has moved with some swiftness to topple a series of octogenarians made strong by the senility system and has advanced the democratic process slightly by opening their own processes to fuller participation.
But in spite of rising prices and unemployment, in spite of increased inflation and dangers of recession, these same men and women as yet have lack the testitcular fortitude to offered no any alternative to President Ford's program to promote of promoting austerity by making the poor pay more for food stamps and gas and by refusing a decent raise in social security. 
But if the years before, the Kennedy and Johnson years, taught us any kind of lesson at all, it ought to have been that government, under militant and concerted pressure, would move, slowly and rather ponderously, all to often with all deliberate lack of speed, to become a limited partner of sorts with the American underclass in their struggle to do better for themselves. 
The last few years have changed all that, the government's policy toward the poor has changed from benign concern to malignant malignant neglect.

In the decade of the sixties, the number of people living in poverty in America was reduced by nearly one third. [Handwritten slash.] It's not at all unreasonable to ascribe some of these gainst to the so-called Great Society and New Frontier programs of that era. Yet despite these victories, the cruel and callous castrators moved with cold calculation to kill, freeze, and wind down urban renewal, model cities, community action, public service employment, student loans, public housing, federal impact funds for education, and to impose a sixty percent national pullback in social services. 
If we are to believe with Thomas Jefferson that the common man is ""the most precious portion of the state,"" we find that precious resource in real danger of economic extinction. 
Human problems are now placed on a balance sheet, forced to add up, to pay for themselves. [Handwritten slash.]
The new administrators in Washington run the programs they direct with all the solictude of a hungry mortician at an old folks home. 
While the nation waltzed into the seventies believing that its ""Black problem"" had either been buried or blown away, infant mortality rates for us remained twice as high as for everyone else, nearly half of all Black families in the United States earned less than $5,000 a year, the average Black American was still dying seven years earlier than his white counterpart, we remained the last to be hired and the first to be fired.
4 9
Watergate became more than an apartment building to live in. Richard Nixon turned it into a shameful nightmare we were forced to live with, more than just a residential-commercial complex crowded against the banks of the Potomac, [Handwritten slash.] Watergate came to symbolize for millions of Americans the lengths to which moronic moral midgets will go to cool their Potomac fever.
Our money is becoming counterfeit in world money markets. Foreign policy bears the stamp of Give-Away Kissinger's kiss of death. Domestic policy suffers for the lack of any attention at all. Schools no longer educate our young. And our young, knowing nothing, are nodding in the doorways of abandoned cities while hoping things will go better with ""coke"". For Black America, the tentative economic gains of the sixties are slowly but surely slipping from our grasp. For Black America, it is still true, despite the War on Poverty which we apparently lost, that one-third of all our children still live in poverty.....a fact that bodes ill for future Black generations. It is still true that a Black college [Handwritten slash.] graduate stands a great chance of earning less money over a lifetime of employment than will a white high school dropout.
5 10
We are where we are today because of a confluence of events of the nineteen sixties. The nonviolent--and in retrospect, lovable--marchers of the first part of that decade began to be replaced, if not in fact then certainly in the public fancy, by the rapacious rioters of the latter part of that decade the sixties. 
America's cities were believed to be either in flames, under martial law, or sinking under the dead weight of a population of pensioners, the unemployed young, or their presumably unemployable parents. 
The middle mind of America was running away from social concerns in a crisis state all their own. They rightly percieved that their taxes--higher proportionally than those paid by their pernicious President of the past -- were escalating to pay for barely maintaining what they were running away from, but they were wrongly taught, by their President and others, that their taxes were high because of the lazy poor and not because of the corporate evader and military glutton.
Lower level administrators--the mayors, councilmen and commissioners--began to face an all too often list of plagues that we have come to call the urban crisis--drug addiction, increased racial friction, civil service militancy, housing destroyed by Plan 'A' faster than it's built by Plan 'B', schools which warehouse and miseducate their students, relief rolls which give relief to no one.
6 11
For them, the New Federalism promised to be manna from heaven. 
It promised new money for them all, money to pave the streets, to pay the police, to clean the air and water. But instead of manna and millions, it became pennies stolen from the poor, robbing Peter to pay Paul half of what Paul couldn't get by on to begin with. 
The result was to shift burden and responsibility--and accountability--from the federal government where the resources were, to the states and towns and cities where the resources aren't. 
The rhetoric from Washington about sharing the wealth became a scandoaolous exercise in consolidating wealth and power where they always were, away from the cities, away from the children, away from people for whom wealth is an extra meal and for whom power is the ability to hide from the census taker. 
The often repeated connection between today's dilemma and the end of the Reconstruction era 100 years ago [Handwritten slash.] is more than frightening. 
The collusion between insensitive administration and a seemingly unfeeling majority seem to doom the hope of the American underclass. 
Then and now, a President desparate for power entered into an illicit arrangement, not just with the unreconstructed South, but with the national unreconstructed mentality that believed then--as it believes now--that private profit and public arrogance could be pursued at the expense of the
12
people living on the American margin.
Concurrently, many of the liberal crusaders for social justice and democracy became tired, or involved in other, less traumatic concerns.
For many of them, picking up beer cans by the side of the public highway became an acceptable substitute to winning jobs in the brewery for Black people.
The aspirations of and movement by Black people began to be curtailed, not just by organized violence and barbarity, but by a series of nationally choreographed legal and extra legal manuevers designed to make us less than political and economic equals.
The frenetic--and often frantic--activity of the nineteen sixties had created a political climate characterized by selfishness and fear: a political constituency was recruited from the frightened to form solid ranks against the forgotten.
Backlash is too hackneyed a term for a people confused by long hair and frightened by clenched fists, their politics misdirected by those who verbally oppose crime in the streets but secretly practice crime in the suites.
This manipulation of the American mind has made the mundane magnificent, and placed government in the hands of men who believe in privilege for the powerful and neglect of the powerless.
13
There can be no better prescription for relieving this crisis, and for reviving some interest in it, than by creating a non-partisan national coalition of need, with us as base of mothers who want care, not warehousing for the children, of workers who want work at a decent and protected wage, of people who work for their living and can't live on what they make as well as those who can't find work but can't live on what we so grudgingly give, of all those people who want an end to welfare and capitalism for the poor and subsidy and socialism for the wealthy and all who must learn that stability for those at the bottom is compatible with sufficiency for those in the middle. . . All those people now live in America, divided now by race and class, fearful of each other, contentious and impotent. [Handwritten line.]
Now the analysts have told us that fewer and fewer of our people see their salvation in the political process. The 1974 election turnout was less than 40% of those eligible, and for the first time, high and low education and income became a factor among those who chose not to choose.
""It is because all the candidates seemed alike,"" someone said, ""alike in appearance, in program, and in promise.""
 9 14
It's true, because the issues then were age and incumbency, and allegiance to fallen idols, or contests between the demonstrated failures of one set of hopefuls and the unproved promises of another; no where was there committment to radical social and economic change of the sort needed to lift the underclass to simple survival level. [Handwritten line.]
An entire political movement came to near maturity in America in the sixties. Fueled by the fire from the Southern civil rights movement, it threatened to challenge the foundations of monoply capital, of white skin privilege, of the racial arrogance that has drained our treasury and young manhood and created vast reservations of the unwanted on this country's soil. 
That movement became the partial victim of its own success. It fought for and won the right to sit in front of the bus, to cast a vote, to sit at a lunch counter. It launched a Southern Black political movement, but it failed to sustain and extend itself, and instead saw itself dissapated by struggles on the edge. 
For some of us, being Black became a rhetorical or sartorial accomplishment. 
For many, social committment began to be measured by the length of your hair, or the intricacy of your handshake.
 10 15
Many of the young people who some years ago marched militantly in the streets are now found running nude on the college grounds, attempting to prove perhaps, that all men are not created equal. 
The political process needs to be put to a test, not as an election day effort alone, but as another weapon in the arsenal that lately has contained more pop guns than howitzers.
16
It comes to climax next year with the selection process for a new President of the United States.
Prior to that selection there must be developed a rational basis for choosing among the varied dozens that offer themselves to us as candidates.
That in turn means the construction among us of a national movement to insist on certain basic themes that must be accepted by a candidate acceptable to us. They would include:

income and wealth redistribution through a tax structure that reduces the disparity between the needy and the greedy;
11 17

the elimination of poverty through a program of full employment supplemented by a negative income tax for workers on the margin; 
an educational system that dignified vocational as well as academic training and permits each American to realize full potential; 
free, adequate health care for all Americans, financed through the national treasury and not profit-making insurance companies; 
effective social control of monopoly, and 
national, regional or municipal ownership of vital services operated for need, and not for profit. [Handwritten slash.]

These promise no perfect world, but do hold out the hope that man can create a system of laws and relationships between men that promise more than our present system of privilege for a few.
We ought to be reminded of some words from Dr. W.E.B. DuBois nearly half a century ago:
""We are American Negroes. It is beside the point to ask whether we form a real race. Biologically we are mingled of all conceivable elements, but race is psychology, not biology, and psychologically we are a unified race with one history, one red memory, one revolt. It is not ours to argue whether we will be segregated or whether we ought to be a caste. We are segregated; we are a caste. Our problem is: how far and in what way can we
12 18
consciously and scientifically guide our future so as to insure our physical survival, our spiritual freedom and our social growth? Either we do this or we die. There is no alternative. If America proposed the murder of our group, its moral descent into imbecility and crime and its utter loss of manhood, self-assertion and courage, the sooner we realize this the better. By that great line of McKay, ""If we must die, let it not be like hogs."" But the alternative of not dying like hogs is not that of dying or killing like snarling dogs. It is rather conquering the world by thought and brain and plan: by expression and organized cultural ideals. Therefore, let us not beat futile wings in impotent frenzy; but carefully plan and guide our segregated life, organize in industry and politics to protect it and expand it. What will be, no one knows. It may be a great physical segregation of the world along the color line; it may be an economic rebirth which [Handwritten slash.] insures spiritual and group integrity amid physical diversity. It may be utter annihilation of class and race and color barriers in one ultimate mankind, differentiated by talent, susceptibility and gift -- but any of these ends are matters of long centuries and not years. We live in years, swift, flying, transient years. We hold the possible future in our hands, but not by wish and will, only by thought, plan and organization.""*

The near genocidal results of the last half decade, fostered by an impotent Congress, unable to resist presidential vetoes, impoundments, cut-backs, shifts in sharing and reverses in revenue have cut sharpest at the people on the bottom, those who traditionally look to their government for some help.
For a time, a portion of that trend appeared to be reversing itself. The normally moribund Congress, wet by Watergate and splashes from the tidal basin, made bold by the sight of one of their own ogling bare breasts in Boston, moved with some swiftness to topple a series of octogenarians made strong by the senility system and advanced the democratic process slightly by opening their own processes to fuller participation.
But in spite of rising prices and unemployment, in spite of increased inflation and dangers of recession, these same men and women lack the testicular fortitude to offer any
8
alternative to President Ford's program of promoting austerity by making the poor pay more for food stamps and gas and by refusing a decent raise in Social Security.
But if the years before, the Kennedy and Johnson years, taught us any lesson at all, it ought to have been that government, under militant and concerted pressure, would move, slowly and rather ponderously, all too often with all deliberate lack of speed, to become a limited partner of sorts with the American underclass in their struggle to do better for themselves.
The last few years have changed all that. The government's policy toward the poor has changed from benign concern to malignant neglect.
In the decade of the sixties, the number of people living in poverty in America was reduced by nearly one third.
9
It's not at all unreasonable to ascribe some of these gains to the so-called Great Society and New Frontier programs of that era. Yet despite these victories, the cruel and callous castrators moved with cold calculation to kill, freeze and wind down urban renewal, model cities, community action, public service employment, student loans, public housing, federal impact funds for education, and to impose a sixty percent national pullback in social services.
If we are to believe with Thomas Jefferson that the common man is ""the most precious portion of the state,"" we find that precious resource in real danger of economic extinction.
Human problems are now placed on a balance sheet, forced to add up, to pay for themselves.
10
The new administrators in Washington run the programs they direct with all the solicitude of a hungry mortician at an old folks home.
While the nation waltzed into the seventies believing that its ""Black problem"" had either been burned or blown away, infant mortality rates for us remained twice as high as for everyone else, nearly half of all Black families in the United States earned less than $5,000 a year, the average Black American was still dying seven years earlier than his white counterpart, we remained the last to be hired and the first to be fired.
Watergate became more than an apartment building to live in. Richard Nixon turned it into a shameful nightmare we were forced to live with. More than just a residential-commercial complex crowded against the banks of the Potomac,
11
Watergate came to symbolize for millions of Americans the lengths to which morinic moral midgets will go to cool their Potomac fever.
Our money is becoming counterfeit in world money markets. Our foreign policy bears the stamp of give-away Kissinger's kiss of death. Domestic policy suffers for the lack of any attention at all. Schools no longer educate our young. And our young, knowing nothing, are nodding in the doorways of abandoned cities while hoping things will go better with ""coke"". For Black America, the tentative economic gains of the sixties are slowly but surely slipping from our grasp. For Black America, it is still true, despite the war on poverty which we apparently lost, that one-third of all our children still live in poverty.....A fact that bodes ill for future Black generations. It is still true that a Black college
12
graduate stands a great chance of earning less money over a lifetime of employment than will a white high school dropout.
We are where we are today because of a confluence of events of the nineteen sixties. The nonviolent--and in retrospect, lovable--marchers of the first part of that decade began to be replaced, if not in fact then certainly in the public fancy, by the rapacious rioters of the latter part of the sixties. America's cities were believed to be either in flames, under martial law, or sinking under the dead weight of a population of pensioners, the unemployed young, or their presumably unemployable parents.
The middle mind of America was running away from social concerns in a crisis state all their own. They rightly perceived that their taxes--higher proportionately than those paid by the pernicious president of the past--were escalating
13
to pay for barely maintaining what they were running away from, but they were wrongly taught, by their president and others, that their taxes were high because of the laze poor and not because of the corporate evader and military glutton. Lower level administrators--the mayors, councilmen and commissioners--began to face an all too often list of plagues that we have come to call the urban crisis--drug addiction, increased racial friction, civil service militancy, housing destroyed by plan 'A' faster than it's built by plan 'B', schools which warehouse and miseducate their students, relief rolls which give relief to no one.
For them, the new federalism promised to be manna from heaven.
It promised new money for all, money to pave the streets, to pay the police, to clean the air and water. But
14
instead of manna and millions, it became pennies stolen from the poor, robbing Peter to pay half of what Paul couldn't get by on to begin with.
The result was to shift burden and responsibility--and accountability--from the federal government where the resources were, to the states and towns and cities where the resources aren't.
The rhetoric from Washington about sharing the wealth became a scandalous exercise in consolidating wealth and power where they always were, away from the cities, away from the children, away from people for whom wealth is an extra meal and for whom power is the ability to hide from the census taker.
The often repeated connection between today's dilemma and the end of the Reconstruction era 100 years ago.
15
is more than frightening.
Then and now, a president desperate for power entered into an illicit arrangement, not just with the unreconstructed South, but with the national unreconstructed mentality that believed then--as it believes now--that private profit and public arrogance could be pursued at the expense of the people living on the American margin.
Concurrently, many of the liberal crusaders for social justice and democracy became tired, or involved in other, less traumatic concerns.
For many of them, picking up beer cans by the side of the public highway became an acceptable substitute to winning jobs in the brewery for Black people.
The aspirations of and movement by Black people began to be curtailed, not by organized violence and barbarity,
16
but by a series of nationally choreographed legal and extra legal manuevers designed to make us less than politican and economic equals.
The frenetic--and often frantic--activity of the nineteen sixties had created a political climate characertized by selfishness and fear;a political constituency was recruited from the frightened to form solid ranks against the forgotten.
Backlash is too hackneyed a term for a people confused by long hair and frightened by clenched fists, their politics misdirected by those who verbally oppose crime in the streets but secretly practice crime in the suites. This manipulation of the American mind has made the mundane magnificent, and placed government in the hands of men who believe in privilege for the powerful and neglect of the powerless.
There can be no better prescription for relieving this crisis, and for reviving some interest in it, than by
17
creating a non-partisan national coalition of need, with us as base, of mothers who want care, not warehousing for the children, of workers who want work at a decent and protected wage, of people who work for their living and can't live on what they make as well as those who can't find work but can't live on what we so grudgingly give, of all those people who want an end to welfare and capitalism for the poor and subsidy and socialism for the wealthy and all who must learn that stability for those at the bottom is compatible with sufficiency for those in the middle.....All those people now live in America, divided now by race and class, fearful of each other, contentious and impotent. Now the analysts have told us that fewer and fewer of our people see their salvation in the political process. The 1974 election turnout was less than 40% of those eligible, and for the first time, high and low
18
education and income became a factor among those who chose not to choose.
""It is because all the candidates seem alike,"" someone said, ""alike in appearance, in program, and in promise.""
It's true, because the issues then were age and incumbency, and allegiance to fallen idols, or contests between the demonstrated failures of one set of hopefuls and the unproved promises of another: nowhere was there commitment to radical social and economic change of the sort needed to lift the underclass to simple survival level.
An entire political movement came to near maturity in America in the sixties. Fueled by the fire from the Southern civil rights movement, it threatened to challenge the foundations of monopoly capital, of white skin privilege,
19
of the racial arrogance that has drained our treasury and young manhood and created vast reservations of the unwanted on this country's soil.
That movement became the partial victim of its own success. It fought for and won the right to sit in front of the bus, to cast a vote, to sit at a lunch counter. It launched a Southern Black political movement, but it failed to sustain and extend itself, and instead saw itself dissipated by struggles on the edge.
For some of us, being Black became a rhetorical or sartorial accomplishment.
For many, social commitment began to be measured by the length of your hair, or the intricacy of your handshake.
Many of the young people who some years ago marched militantly in the streets are now found running nude on the college grounds, attempting to prove perhaps, that all men
20
are not created equal.
The political process needs to be put to a test, not as an election day effort alone, but as another weapon is an arsenal that lately has contained more pop guns than howitzers.
It comes to climax next year with the selection process for a new president of the United States.
Prior to that selection there must be developed a rational basis for choosing among the varied dozens that offer themselves to us as candidates.
That in turn means the construction among us of a national movement to insist on certain basic themes that must be accepted by a candidate acceptable to us. They would include:
21

income and wealth redistribution through a tax structure that reduces the disparity between the needy and the greedy;
the elimination of poverty through a program of full employment supplemented by a negative income tax for workers on the margin;
an educational system that dignifies vocational as well as academic training, and permits each American to realize full potential;
free, adequate heath care for all Americans, financed through the national treasury and not profit-making insurance companies;
effective social control of monopoly, and
national, regional or municipal ownership of vital services operated for need, and not for profit.

22
These promise no perfect world, but do hold out the hope that man can create a system of laws and relationships between men that promise more than our present system of privilege for a few.
We ought to be reminded of some words from Dr. W. E. B. DuBois nearly half a century ago:
""We are American Negroes. It is beside the point to ask whether we form a real race. Biologically we are mingled of all conceivable elements, but race is psychology, not biology, and psychologically we are a unified race with one history, one red memory, one revolt. It is not ours to argue whether we will be segregated or whether we ought to be a caste. We are segregated; we are a caste. Our problem is: how far and in what way can we consciously and scientifically guide our future so as to insure our physical
23
survival, our spiritual freedom and our social growth? Either we do this or we die. There is no alternative. If America proposed the murder of our group, its moral descent into imbecility and crime and its utter loss of manhood, self-assertion and courage, the sooner we realize this the better. By that great line of McKay, ""If we must die, let it not be like hogs."" But the alternative of not dying like hogs is not that of dying or killing like snarling dogs. It is rather conquering the world by thought and brain and plan; by expression and organized cultural ideals. Therefore, let us not beat futile wings in impotent frenzy; but carefully plan and guide our segregated life, organize in industry and politics to protect it and expand it. What will be, no one knows. It may be a great physical segregation of the world along the color line; it may be an economic rebirth which
24
insures spiritual and group integrity amid physical diversity. It may be utter annihilation of class and race and color barriers in one ultimate mankind, differentiated by talent, suceptibility and gift--but any of these ends are matters of long centuries and not years. We live in years, swift, flying, transient years. We hold the possible future in our hands, but not by wish and will, only by thought, plan and organization.""*

Gains ewere won at lunch counters or movie theaters or polling places or bus stations and the fabric of legal apartheid in America was destroyed.
What had been a movement for civil rights became a political movement, and Black men and women won office and power never dreamed of before.
But despite an increase of 150% in the number of Blacks holding office, despite the ability to sit or eat or ride or vote in places that formerly lacked Black faces, in a real way we find
2
our condition unchanged.
A quick look at every statistic that measures how well or how poorly a group of people is doing--infant mortality rates, median family income, life expectancy--shows that while our general condition has improved, our relative position has actually worsened.
It is almost as though we were climbing a mollasses mountain dressed in snowshoes while everyone else rides a rather leisurely ski lift to the top.
Now the ski slopes are more treacherous and the mollasses melting into mud, a Sargasso Sea of crime in high places, of joblessness for many and hopelessness for more.
Yesterdays gains become suspect. The bus front seat loses meaning for a people whose longest trip is from the feudal system of the rural South to the mechanized, high-rise poverty of the urban North.
The right to vote loses meaning for a people forced to choose
3
between Tweedledum and Tweedledee.
The right to an integrated education can mean little for children bussed from one ignorant academy to another.
The struggles of the sixties were carried forward against discrimination in housing, employment, education, and government both because the victims became their own best champions and because they found a sympathetic ear in the body politic.
But as the demands became more strident, as a foreign war drained treasury and manhood, as the best and the brightest were beaten down by bullets, a shift occurred in the national consciousness.
We stand now on the eve of our 200th birthday--afraid of what the future will bring and afraid to look too critically at our past, to assign guilt and responsibility for our common condition.
A look backward shows a decade and a half of movement, agitation and protest, whose results are suspect today.
10
The arsenal of the Black liberation struggle in America. / That notion shared with other philosophies a prominent place on the agenda of the national Black political assembly, [illegible] founded by [illegible] poet and author, Amiri Baraka. This attempt at grassroots organizing among the poor and the Black for political leverage on a national basis has been somewhat interrupted as the exceptionally strong and gifted leaders of that movement pause to rethink the goals and strategies that can best achieve the desired ends of the masses.\
But [illegible] for now Black America appears to be committed to achieving its self interests through political action resembling the methods that have traditionally been used by ethnic minorities to gain for themselves a piece of America's action. Some of us are disappointed and a bit puzzled by the apparent turn away from a reform of American political machinery. Some of us wished for a major challenge to the politics-as-usual system that exists in America
11
today. But most of us have compromised to the extent that we can see some benefits flowing to Blacks just by the fact that we have opted for a piece of the existing action even as we struggle to reform the political organisms from the inside.
(A warning ought to be inserted here--despite the overpowering personalities and charismatic giants who dominated the beginning of this period and whose memory still is summoned to stir the present, this history is essentially a history of shifting organizational strengths and goals, of the rise and fall of groups, not leaders, the change in tactics, not of men).
To understand the ramifications of this necessary change in emphasis [illegible], you must again recall recall again the sixties and remember what civil rights organizations were about then. In those days, the civil rights movement was what a few persuasive organizations said it was: the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People said
12
the movement embraced concerns for integrated and quality education and concerns for a breakdown of all legal barriers to minority participation in the mainstream of American life; the National Urban League was the service organization that tended to implement with skill and expertise those social programs that resulted from confrontations in the streets; the Southern Christian Leadership Conference, led by Dr. Martin Luther Kind, Jr., was the mobilizer of bodies willing to protest
8 13
evil and injustice, it was the national conscience that ultimately moved a United State President to proclaim that we shall overcome; the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee, [illegible] provided the shock troops, the community organizers who moved [illegible] audaciously onto frightfully dangerous terrain to sensitize oppressed Blacks and to demonstrate by their own fearlessness that the system could be challenged and changed; the Congress of Racial Equality was part organizer, part mobilizer, and it was the group that took incredible risks to dramatize before the nation the evils of a racist and oppressive society.
All of these groups had one thing in common--open confrontation; whether it be in the courts, in the streets, or on the interstate buses, all of these groups lobbied straight to at the American conscience, bypassing legislatures and the Congress to inflame the nation to the point that lawfully constituted authority that should have acted did indeed feel compelled to act. And all of these groups died faded in the middle sixties for all intents and purposes. The NAACP and the Urban League, of course, still flourish, but neither is any longer the cutting edge of the civil rights movement, and both are being drawn into public policy concerns that can no longer be described solely as civil rights issues, or even Black issues for that matter.
Polls in the sixties continually ranked Roy Wilkins, Whitney Young, Martin Luther King, Jr., James Farmer, Floyd McKissick, John Lewis and other confrontation leaders as the most trusted and most recognized leaders of Black people in America. No [illegible] doubt a poll in the middle seventies would reflect some of the same sentiment. But I'm convinced that leaders of such a poll today would include Tom Bradley, Mayor of Los Angeles; Richard Hatcher, Mary of Gary, Indiana; and Coleman A. Young, Mayor of Detroit,. [and perhaps even Julian Bond, a poor Georgia state senator with mere modest aspirations to trade a house in Atlanta for one in Washington, D.C.]
9 14
Many things have happened to cause this public idolotry of elected officials among Blacks. While the big national civil rights organizations have faded away waned, they did leave in their wake an intelligent, trained cadre of local-level leaders. Jesse Jackson began as a local leader in Chicago and had terrific impact on the city because he had been spawned by the movement Dr. King had led. And many of [us who are] those in politics today are veterans of the big, national civil rights movements. Thus, those of us who would show up favorably in a poll of Black sentiment [illegible] today tend to be those who['ve] built local bases, multiplied our their constituency through a skilled approach to national issues, and gained some measure of national support for local efforts.
[illegible] No one can count all of the Black [illegible] politicians who have moved from the streets to the halls of government. I am one, of course. Others are Andrew Young, once the principal staff aide to Dr. King and now a U.S. Congressman; Marion Barry, the first chairman of the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee, who now is a powerful City Councilman in Washington; Walter Fauntroy, now a national Congressman, who once served Dr. King in Washington. There are scores of others of real influence who have welcomed the opportunity to translate the laws they helped initiate into public policies that Blacks can appreciate.
Moreoever, our organizations today tend to lean more toward the political. I do not refer here to partisan political organizations. I mean, rather, that organizations, public interest organizations if you will, are being formed to bring a Black perspective to policy issues and to leverage the actions of older, more powerful and predominantly white organizations so that they, too, will become our spokesmen and thereby multiply the weight of our small numbers.
The Voter Education Project flourishes today because there are still literally millions of Blacks [most] in the South who are eligible to vote
9 10 15
but who, for whatever their reasons, have failed to register. The Southern Conference of Black Mayors organized around the [illegible] 76 or so Black chief executives of cities and towns in the South in order to focus more attention on the problems of rural and small town America; and it performs the very necessary service of bringing to the attention of its members those goods and services available at the national, regional and state levels that can be usedfo for the benefit of the mayors'' constituents.
The National Black Caucus of local elected officials is an organization of Black mayors, councilmen and county commissioners. It functions as a agitating unit of the National League of Cities and the U.S. Conference of Mayors. Its purpose is to force those giant lobbying organizations to adopt a Black perspective on major policy issues affecting the nation and to accept Black input into their agenda as they develop, package and sell to the Congress a national urban policy.
And then there is the Joint Center for Political Studies in Washington. This institution was created directly as a result of the concerns I described as I opened this lecture. Its mandate compels it to provide to all Black and minority elected officials a Black perspective on the most significant current public policy issues; it brings to minority elected officials information on government programs, policies and regulations they could hardly get from any other source; it offers technical assistance to Black elected officials, some of whom, because Blacks have traditionally been excluded from the political process, are excellent undertakers, but need every kind of help imaginable if they are to function as mayors and as council members.
Black political caucuses are springing up in every state of the union. And as a rule they are more prone to deal with issues that affect Black people than they are to involve themselves in bickering over partisan issues. They have come to realize that a Black Republican and a Black Democrat suffer essentially the same humiliation of oppression; that a Black militant
10 11 16
and a Black moderate are simply two different reactions to the same pain; and that Black non-participants in the political process are the single greatest threat to Black political advancement all over America.
And When the organizing of the seventies is not political, it tends to be economic. For we have all come to understand that those things that were legislated in the sixties require of us in the seventies the means and the clout to grab a piece of the action for ourselves. Thus the National Welfare Rights Organization, while it occasionally demonstrates in the streets, is basically an organization that [illegible] exerts heavy pressures on social legislation; the National Tenants Organization focuses on issues that affect housing and the condition of living units normally inhabited by the Black poor; the Federation of Southern Cooperatives is a noble experiment in the power of unity to bring at least food and livable wages, if not huge profits, to poor rural Blacks who were are accustomed to working from sun up to sun down for three dollars a day; Jesse Jackson's Operation Push is boldly struggling to create a Black capitalist class in hopes that the spoils from this system will filter down to other Blacks and enrich us all; the National Committee on Household Employment, [illegible] is another group that is influential on national policy and on local policy that deals with maids and butlers and all manner of other household workers. The name of the game is economics and politics, and one complements the other in the system that Blacks are now beginning to master.
I might also mention my own organization, the Southern Elections Fund. It is the business of encouraging superior Black candidates to seek public offices and to not not to shy away from politics because they believe it to be dirty and corrupt. Our organization makes small campaign contributions to those who hneed our advice, and we operate most effectively in those areas
11 12 17
of America's Southland where a $25 contribution can mean the difference between victory and defeat and where a $100 contribution can almost guarantee a landslide victory. For we know that the economic situation of most Blacks in the rural South disqualifies them from even considering public service as a career. Thus we attempt to match our political concerns with some small degree of economic clout so that the Black man, or even the liberal white, who has ambition to serve is not hindered from entering the political arena by the size of the deficit in his household budget.
Strangely, a national government that is not necessarily in open sympathy with Black aspirations for power has aided our cause in several ways. I do not mean the government's Black capitalism movement, which has been revealed repeatedly to be an insincere [illegible] ploy to draw credit to an administration that was a national debit itself. I mean, how much trust can you maintain be maintained when you know the Congress has authorized a $400 million expenditure by for the Small Business Administration, yet administration-appointed officials of that same agency looks Congress dead in the eye and asks for a mere $40 million appropriation, a mere one tenth of what Congress in 1974 was prepared to give?
I refer to those programs that the Nixon administration could not wait to kill under the guise of folding them into larger programs he labeled as block grant programs. The best known program under that the latter theory is [illegible] revenue sharing. But before Nixon killed them, the government supported categorical grant programs, which meant that a community with a serious problem in one area could petition the government for a grant of money that could then be used to resolve that specific problem. And the beauty of these categorical programs was that citizens groups qualified for funding, and did not have to go through the often recalcitrant city governments that were unresponsive to their needs anyway in the first place.
12 13 18
In several of the programs, such as model cities, even the portion of the monies awarded to city governments were tied to a formula that required not only citizen input, but actually gave citizens the power to organize themselves and actively oppose the local government plan, and to do so successfully. This element in the categorical programs [illegible] awakened many dormant Black communities and escalated the participation of Blacks in a system that was affecting their lives. With government funds at stake, they were able to organize effective, grassroots, nonpartisan political units that turned out to be the very fuel that subsequently powered Black mayors and other Black elected officials into offices all over America. As I said, the Nixon administration could not wait to snuff out cripple that grassroots power and . He replaced the categorical programs with block grants to qualified cities . wThose officials now make all of the decisions on how money is to be allocated with very little citizen input and no mandate to respond affirmatively to even massive citizen outcries.
I do not want here to sound negative. I do believe, again, that politics is one of the principal ways by which Black Americans will negotiate themselves into the power councils of America. And despite the obstacles that are constantly rolled into our pathway, I am certain that Black Americans will embrace the political process as a principal means of achieving for ourselves what practically every other ethnic group in America has achieved for themselves.
And I am given cause to hope a little that we have reached nowhere near the saturation point in our efforts to utilize the political system to our benefit. It is indeed true that probably all but one of the congressional districts in America with majority Black populations are represented by Black congressmen. But I am encouraged because so of the number of Black representatives who were never elected from all-Black or
13 1419
predominantly-Black districts in the first place. Ronald Dellums is from a minority Black congressional district in California. As quiet as it's kept, Andrew Young's congressional district in Atlanta is still majority white, according to the 1970 Census figures.
I am even more encouraged by the small but growing number of Black officials who have been able to attract votes on a statewide basis. We all know, of course, that no state in the United States comes anywhere close to being predominantly-Black. You've probably heard of U.S. Senator Edward W. Brooke of Massachusetts, where Blacks account for barely three percent of the statewide population. But you should also know of the statewide constituency that put into office the likes of Richard Austin, Secretary of State in Michigan...Henry Parker, State Treasurer in Connecticut....George Brown, Lieutenant Governor in Colorado....Mervyn Dymally, Lieutenant Governor in California....Wilson Riles, State Superintendent of Public Instruction in California....Robert N.C. Nix, Jr., State Supreme Court Justice in Pennsylvania.
What this says to me is two things: first, it indicates that Black aspirants themselves no longer feel constrained to wait until a particular political jurisdiction becomes a ghetto before they decide to run for office. When they are confident that they are indeed the best candidate running, they are confident that they are indeed the best candidate running, they are more and more prone to plunge without fear into a contest that requires the approval of a majority of all votes in the state. Secondly, it seems to indicate that white voters are beginning more and more to accept the credentials of a qualified Black candidate and to hear from that Black candidate a broad appeal to interests they share in common beyond the accidents of race. As the Black voter is becoming more sophisticated, there is some evidence that the white voter, too, is becoming too sophisticated to buy Jim Crow from a white candidate when a Black candidate appears sounds as though he can might put a steak in every skillet.
14 15 20
As Eddie Williams, President of the Joint Center for Political Studies, said in testimony before a Congressional Subcommittee recently: ""The election of any official--Black or white--does not necessarily guarantee good government. But when Blacks and other minorities are elected, there is greater diversity in the policy-making process; there is easier access by minorities to the institutions which determine who gets how much of what, when and how. Black participation in politics, whether as voter or as elected or appointed official, not only encourages broader citizen participation, which is desirable, but assures fair representation, which is imperative. Moreover, it provides evidence that the political process is adaptable to the needs and aspiration of all citizens....I think it is appropriate that we recall the words of Thomas Jefferson: 'The way to have good and safe government is not to trust it all to one, but to divide it among the many.'""
That wisdom, I believe, has now pervaded the Black psyche. And because of it I feel comfortable in standing here today predicting that the future of the civil rights movement among Black Americans rests in large part in the hands of those Blacks who are now at the commands of the machinery of government; those Black men and women who are committed to manipulateing the political process from inside the system so that it can begin to deliver to Black Americans what it has always afforded other Americans.
I believe, further, that it is in the self-interest of each individual and of every American to allow this news movement an unimpeded opportunity to succeed. For if it is allowed to fail, if it is made to fail by some sinister forces that, as during Reconstruction, seek to prove paint Black leadership as corrupt and incompetent: if for some reason this movement cannot propel as many Black Americans to march behind the precinct captains the way we once marched behind the protest leader; if America fails to respond
15 16 21
to this peaceful petitioning for fair and equitable representation; if our leaders are frustrated in their genuine effort to deliver to Black America a portion of the goods and services government is charged to provide; if all of this Black effort to work within the system to produce change cannot be reconciled with the national self-interest, and if the movement in this regard cannot be absorbed by the American system; then then, I ask you, what is there left to do? What will America have said to us? How must we then respond to this latest rejection? What must we tell our already impatient children?
This may be our last civil rights movement. While we chart its course, or at least try to, America's response to us is what in the last analysis will really termine the determine the future of the civil rights movement . and I predict that at the same time, it will be determining the future of America itself.

We are here to pay tribute to a great city leader, an intelligent and articulate man. I know him and respect him. I am here this afternoon to poke fun at Maynard -- but I am also here to reveal a side of him that you may not know. You may not know it but Maynard is NOT a racist.
I want to thank you for inviting me to roast Maynard -- to roast Maynard we really don't have enough time.
They say that a man can be judged by his friends... I can't find anyone willing to judge Maynard.
We all know that Maynard can't run the city -- but who's going to tell him. Maynard, don't be discouraged by the daily headlines blasting your administration because they are supposed to do investigative research and tell it like it is -- when Sam Massell was Mayor they COULD call a spade a spade -- but with you there they wouldn't dare.
In two years you will have an opportunity to run again and believe me when I say this you will be judged by what you've accomplished.... Since you've been mayor the Hawks, Braves and the Falcons have gone UP -- (pause) in FLAMES.
You and Reggie ought to focus attention on the Falcons ... Maybe Reggie can put a bugging device in Fran Tarkenton's helmet by Sunday's game time.
2
If you are not careful the Chamber of Commerce will support Wade Mitchell next time for Mayor ... And we all know what his campaign slogan will be. And it will catch on -- Remember ""It's a brand new ball game?"" Your campaign strategists might be watching out for the wrong man as your possible opposition ... WYCHE FOWLER probably won't run but if Pepper Rodgers beats Notre Dame Saturday LOOK OUT because Atlanta is desperate for a winner.
If Ivan the III decides to run he can rightfully be called a chip off the old block. His campaign theme will be: Maynard's a block that needs to be chipped.
Since you've become Mayor racial slurs have died down but unless annexation is caregfully put before the people your opposition will be able to say ""I told y'all if you give them an inch they would ........
I have often said that the Georgia State Legislature is the best group of people money can buy.. Folks, Maynard has his price... Sandy Springs and the Industrial Park... If I were a white businessman living in Sandy Springs my message to my wife would be ""Honey, guess who's coming to dinner? ---- Hosea Williams.""
Recently the Constitution printed a story on Atlanta's black power structure, revealing that former law partner David Franklin has Maynard's ear. Atlanta is the first city since Biblical times to be run by David and Goliath.
3
Maynard, let's show white people that you are serious about annexation -- schedule the next People's Day at Maddox's Underground Pickrick and I will join you at the lunch counter. If we got enough blacks to eat his fried chicken he could pay off his campaign debt... then he wouldn't have to sell so many damn ax handles. You see we wkno know who's contributing to the muggings in Underground.
You know that joint ventures ought to be a TWO-WAY STREET... I could see it now: eat at M & M's Restaurant today -- a) MAYNARD and MADDOX's (special today)-- Chitlins and Chicken; or dine at b) Hosea's Pittypat Porch -- special: Cooked Goose, Chocolate Cream Humble Pie....Let Hosea cook your goose.
And on second thought Reggie Eaves ought to have a stake-out squad at the Underground because I've wondered where all those white people were going... There's a secret tunnel behind the kitchen at the Pickrick that leads to Sandy Springs--- the NEW Underground Railroad.
Maynard, I hope you don't mind if I reveal for the first time the real reason why you want a new airport -- someone has to handle the WHITE FLIGHTS.
What does the rhino at the zoo and Maynard have in common -- not that they are large -- but they BOTH will benefit from the upcoming bond issue.
4
I do hope the Chamber supports Maynard and his Bond Committee Chairmen Bert Lance and Bill Allison -- because selling a bond issue is a difficult task -- it's like trying to convince your wife that even a bargain costs money.
I shouldn't have said that Atlanta sports have suffered since you've been mayor. After all you showed us that you can and will fight -- When I refereed the Ali fight here in Atlanta he was unable to hit you anywhere because the rules say you can't hit below the belt.
The Chamber should promote Atlanta as the Championship City --Muhammead wouldn't come to the mountain -- so the mountain fell on Muhammead. Meet Maynard, the only man to shut Muhammead's mouth.
You gentlemen know how to sell so I ask you all to help Maynard in his annexation struggle... The Chamber could launch a campaign called OPPOSITES ATTRACT... but Maynard will have to help too. I will try to get Maynard to realize that the whites in this city knew something was up when he stopped singing We Shall Overcome and started humming that old Negro spiritual There's NO HIDING PLACE Down Here.

I just flew in from N.Y. this morning
Maynard - the black community is proud you. You were Atlanta's first Mayor to tackle the problem of white trash -- Herbie the Curbie.
There is a lot of talk and hullabaloo these days about Joint Ventures ---
Like the Rev. Clark said ""We Elected Maynard to get a piece of the pie ---- To look at Maynard we know he's gotten his piece, my piece your piece. 
But don't worry Maynard, on this issue we know you haven't bitten off more than you can chew.

You gentlemen of the Chamber of Commerce who work with profit and loss statements and balance sheets on a daily basis will know what I mean when I say that Maynard is a credit to his race.
After watching politicians like Talmadge, Maddox and Ivan All J.B. Stoner, George Wallace Nixon, Agnew and now Ford -- I'm glad we all look alike, Maynard.
Since Maynard has become Mayor crime
The crime rate has gone down since Maynard has become Mayor and will continue to go down if he stops giving out so many damn keys to the city.
Maynard
According to the New City Charter Maynard can be on only be elected to two consecutive terms,......pause + then Now I would like to give back the ten dollars you gave me to say a lot of good things about you. or Maynard pol I was told to balance my remarks to say something good about Maynard.

How does a man like Maynard come along and rise to the top -- Hot air Rises
Maynard
While growing up I was always told by my father that you are what you eat... I am here today to tell you that Maynard is what he eats.... Big Words. or (His words)
In preparing for this roast I did extensive research into Maynard's background because I wanted to point out the highlights of his career before he became Mayor. First of all, Maynard graduated from Morehouse, and later got married......pause that takes care of before he became Mayor...... After becoming Mayor he [illegible]. (well I'm still researching)
I wrote to all of Maynard's graduating class and long list of his heavy financial contributors to tell them that we were honoring Maynard today with a roast.... I have 3 telegrams that I'd like to read they are from Reggie Eaves, Jules Sugarman I can't make out the name on the 3rd but it comes from the gentleman who couldn't get in today but he wants to thank you for the table in [the parking lot.]

If Annexation works we ought to run Maynard for president maybe we could get Canada and Mexico.
Let's help him - he's going places but of course we'd have to put checks and balances on him or he will want to complete General Sherman's march to the sea.
The Constitution could help too have you noticed that every time Maynard's picture appears in the paper they always manage to put Delta's ad near it ""Delta is ready when you are."" You think they are trying to tell you something Maynard?
When Maynard runs again he can't be called the dark horse candidate - But, he can be called a horse of another color.
What does Muskie, Chisholm, McGovern comm. have in common
I hope the new bicentennial Issue of the 2$ bill will is issued. -Save them because they can be used for your Marta fare.
I tell my friends - ""Come to Atlanta, a city run by Sugarman and Sugar Daddy

I will be happy when the new bicentennial 2$ bill is issued - maybe we can use them for Marta fares.
Maynard gets slighted and a lot because of his size.... He is a big man. - Recently I saw a TV news account showing Andy Young and Sen. Talmadge paddling a canoe down the Chattahoochee to dramatize the pollution...pause Why didn't they invite Maynard?
As a po
I've been a politician for 10yrs and I know Maynard's support is deep far and wide and when I hear him talk I know it's deep too.
Through all the turmoil and headache of being mayor he somehow manages to remain in good spirits -- he can't afford the luxury of getting up on the wrong side of the bed - Atlanta's first lady would our last.
I have no hesitation in explaining why I travel all over the country speaking trying to earn a living make enough money -- I am my brother's keeper. (point to Maynard)

Maynard the new Charter gives you full control and more power but that's no excuse to have your finger in every pie.
Remember how Nixon and his cohorts were caught trying to rip off the Govt. Don't worry about Maynard doing anything of the kind. He's so big that if he ever tried to feather his nest we wouldn't need an audit from Price Waterhouse to find it.
In closing I like to say some NICE things about the Mayor
[In margin] Pause after each

He doesn't have feet of Clay
 - knows which side his bread is buttered
He's more than meets the eye
Not only does he have a leg to stand on - He needs two
He's not a fence-sitter
Leaves no stones unturned
Let's no grass grow under his feet.
When Maynard got elected we got more than we bargained for.

We intend today to poke fun at Maynard, and to show a side of him you may not know.
You may have wondered how a young man like Maynard has managed to rise in politics so quickly. Its simple - hot air rises.
It's obvious by just looking at the Mayor that when we elected him, we got more than we bargained for.
One major change has occurred in the transition from the past administration to this one - when Sam Massel was Mayor, you could call a spade a spade - now you wouldn't dare.
Massel is Jewish and Maynard Black, demonstrating that being in a minority may not be a handicap in Atlanta politics. It's not true that Wyche Fowler and Ivan Alley the 3rd are becoming Buddists.
I was in New York City just this morning. I think you'll be pleased to know Atlanta will never have New York's problems. It all began when Mayor Beame walked under a Black cat.
Under the new city charter, Maynard is Atlanta's highest paid mayor. It could be worse; we could pay him by the pound.
Rev. Ted Clark said that when Maynard was elected, we all thought we'd get a piece of the pie. Now Rev Clark complains that Maynard has eaten the pie himself.
Rev. Clark found a dead jackass in his driveway, and knowing the garbage-man wouldn't be around for another week, he called Maynard. Maynard said ""Reverend; why call me?"" ""You're susposed to bury the dead."" ""Yes"", Rev. Clark said, ""but I'm also susposed to notify the next of kin.""
When Maynard was first elected, he was approached by a delegation of Atlanta's wealthier citizens who said they were worried about poor white trash. That's when Maynard invented Herby the Curbie.
Maynard and the Atlanta newspapers have been in a constant quarrell ever since they revealed that David Franklin was the Mayer's closest advisor. This is the first American city to be ruled by David and Goliath.
The papers like to play tricks on Maynard too. Last week they ran the announcement of a new joint venture contract at the airport next to an airline ad that said, ""Delta Is Ready When You Are.""
Maynard has a lot of experience in the business world. He's sold encyclopedias and he used to work in the men's wear department at Rich's. He resents it however, when the newspapers call him a ""tie coon.""
When Maynard was elected Mayor, the city's theme song became We Shall Overcome. If his annexation plans suceed, it will change to ""Ain't No Hiding Place Down Out There""
Its a good thing that the University of Georgia was segregated during Maynard's college days. Think of the trouble we'd have finding jobs for 10,000 classmates
It's a good thing the Treasury Department has announced the return of the $2.00 bill. That's what's MARTA's fare will be by the time its finished.
Maynard was quite a ladies man before he got married. I can remember two Spelman coeds discussing how well he dressed. And how quickly.
Maynard gets a lot of support from his family. After a hard day at the office, he complained to his wife - ""Sometimes I think I only have one friend - my dog."" So she bought him another dog.
Maynard was happy when Hank Aaron broke Babe Ruth's record, but sorry that Ruth wouldn't have anything to dance to.
Maynard had a dream in which he died and went to heaven. Because he was used to deferential treatment here on earth, he tried to go to the head of the line, but St. Peter sent him back. A few minutes later he tried to move up again, but again St. Peter sent him back. Finally he saw a young bearded man who was wearing a badge which read ""Mayor"" moving in and out of Heaven freely.
Maynard complained that this Mayor had received [guard] preferential treatment and that he wanted to be treated the same way.
""You don't understand,"" St. Peter said. ""That's God. He just likes to play Mayor now and then."""

My second thought, was probably notheing, but it would give me an opportunity to sharpen my focus on the subject and share with you some of my reactions to a problem that has long plagued Americans, [illegible] especially black Americans.
I think you will agree that the effects of drug addiction in the black community are [illegible] devastating. There is usually one or more unsavory drug store operators in every section of the ghetto who will sell Robitussin AC or some other exempt narcotics to the kids with full awareness of their abuse intentions. For example, a two dollar bottle of cough syrup will be sold for six or eight dollars.
The crippling effect of alcohol on the social well-being
2
of the black community is also well-known. A disproportionate number of liquor stores are found in the ghetto. Often they stay open later at night. Through the years, many a senseless homicide in and outside of taverns or at dance halls have occurred in a setting of excessive alcohol consumption. Approximately half of the auto fatalities can be traced to one party driving while intoxicated.
We have evidence that over the last few years, barbiturate abuse has become a steadily rising problem among many black teenagers in or out of school. And the teenager on barbiturates is considerably more dangerous to those around him than is the case with other drugs.
While ""speed"" was popularized by the young white drug using subcultures of San Francisco and Los Angeles during the late sixties, serious amphetamine abuse in the black community began ten gto twelve x years earlier.
The only one of the four basic categories of drugs that is not more serious among blacks than whites is the hallucinogen. As a rule, blacks shy away from LSD and drugs of this type. We
3
can only speculate as to why this is the case. Perhaps one reason is that the supply routes are different than with the more traditional drugs: England, the West Coast, the college campus, amateur chemistry labs. Unfortunately, however, there are signs that some of the more educated brothers who are becoming more integrated into the majority culture, are beginning to ""drop acid.""
In view of the serious consequences of fact that drug addiction is such a serious menace to the black community, I have in the past, and may again, overreact to te the problem. Try and understand why many black Americans, including myself, are more than a little resentful by the incredible national inattention to what has essentially been a black problem -- until the drug problem moved out of the black ghetto and began to threaten the comfortable white suburbs and those curious middle and upper middle class youngsters residing in them.
More than once I have thought that if the larger society had chosen to exert half the effort it is beginning to muster in dealing
4
with illicit drug use when the problem was essentially confined to the ghetto, we might well have had no problem in either community now. Even today, one gets the impression that the black community is being slighted in the relative attention it receives, particularly in terms of financial support for treatment and education programs.
I must confess to a second reaction to the drug problem. As horrific as it may sound, my immediate impulse to dealing with the problem is to engage in x vigilante action, the sole purpose of which would be to deliver summary punishment to the pusher on the street, to confine the addict until he begs for release, and eliminate what my colleagues in the Georgia General Assembly may consider do-good bleeding heart Eastern liberal reformist programs aimed at coddling addicts. In fact, young militant groups, such as the Panthers, have begun to give notice that pushers and drug peddlers are enemies and exploiters of black people and that their continualed existence will not be tolerated.
While I admit to utter contempt for the pusher with his fine clothes and fancy cars preying on black youths, I am not unsympathetic to the plight of the hopeless youths in our society
5
who are being preyed upon. Typically, the x black youth gets caught up in the drug scene during his late teens and remains a victim the better part of his adult life. Dropping out of school is the usual result, followed by the embarking upon a career of hustling in the street by using his or her wits.
As you well know, a narcotics habit increases in cost the longer one has it. The ten dollar a day habit grows to forty or fifty dollars in a matter of months and it is not infrequent for the addict to spend 75 to 100 dollars a day for heroin. Fantastic amounts of energy, creativity, and intelligent planning are devoted to getting money to pay for one's [habit] habit. Most of this involves illegal pursuits. Many sell drugs to others as a way of making money. The addict ""turning"" drugs does quite well economically, but unfortunately, most of what he makes goes into his own arm.
Contrary to a widely circulated myth, most addicts are brighter than normal. Nevertheless, most eventually do get caught and periodically serve time in prison. The mortality rate of narcotics addicts is several times higher than that for the general population. In addition to themselves, addicts hurt their families. They drain them of their financial resources, lie
6
to them, disappoint them. If small children are involved, they may be severely neglicted.
As serious as the situation has been during peak epedemic periods in past years, there is every indication that drug addiction, particularly heroin, is one again on the upswing.
Only a year and a half ago, there were many hopeful signs that the heroin problem was coming under control through the combined efforts of treatment and law enforcement. In most communities, overdose deaths, hepatitis and crime rates were declining after steadily rising for a decade.
But because of the influx of heroin from Mexico and Turkey's renewed opium cultivation, we are finding increased demand for gtreatment not only in the Southwest, but in Chicago, Philadelphia, and Boston. We are finding further demands for treatment in cities which had not previously reported significant demand.
Combined with new supplies of heroin, is a recessionary economic situation which can only increase the numbers of jobless, frustrated, hopeless citizens who comprise those groups most susceptible to drug addiction. Add to this dismal
7
picture, cutbacks on funding for treatment and drug prevention activities, and the consequences will be disastrous for the entire country.
There is also increasing data to support current hypotheses that heroin use - a a social phenomenon - can be expected to spread in relatively short periods of time from the core of major urban areas to medium-sized and small cities and even into the rural heartland of America.
Obviously, the correct response to this potentially crippling situation is not one of unbriddled outrage and bitterness. But rather one of deliberate, rational, coordn coordinated action on local, state, and federal levels.
Furthermore, it seems to me that an effective strategy for the control of drug addiction must ensure a coordinated plan involving law enforcement, treatment, and prevention or education. A fundamental assumption, however, must be that the drug addict is a sick person and not a criminal. A report of the American Bar Association Committee on Addiction and Crime makes this pof point:
8
""What is needed is a bold new policy which recognizes heroin addiction not as a moral problem to be dealt with through harsh penal sanctions but as a disease for the individual addict and health crisis for the rest of society. It is a health crisis which must be dealth with principally by hospitals, doctors and clinics, not by police and jasi jails.""

Since the concerns of this group center around treatment and prevention, I would like to stress what I consider to be essential [illegible] factors in developing and operating a [illegible] successful treatment program.
As I stated earlier, it is my impression that the black community is being slighted in the relative attention it receives, particularly in terms of financial support for treatment and education programs.
Since most of the people on methadone todayk are black, the black community should demand assurance that history is not allowed to repeat itself as when heroin was introduced at the turn of the century as the cure for morphine addiction. Being dependent upon [illegible] methadone
9
(or worse, those who control its distribution) is not a permanently satisfactory state of affairs. At this point no one has a full xx answer, and all of the programs presently in xxx use deserve support. The community, however, must exert pressure on practitioners and researchers to not be content with partial answers. The government must be forced to fund private community based programs at a level communsurate with the way it funds well-established state and university operated programs.
With regard to drug treatment centers, I would give greater attention to placing them in black communities, easily accessible to housing projects those neighborhoods with high concentrations of addicts and marginal youths.
Since drug abuse is a sympton of serious underlying problems, treatment programs must address the factors often recognized as related to drug abuse such as: unemployment, lack of education and training, and inadequate recreational facilities.
Related to this, is the need to coordinate treatment programs with other programs to combat xxxx related social problems.
I must also stress the importance of involving community members themselves in the development of their own
10
members themselves in the development of their own drug abuse programs.
And now, let me conclude with some general legislative recommendations. Our elected representatives must be made aware that drug addiction is a medical problem rather than a legal one and is best handled by avoiding the complications associated with criminalizing the addict. Legislation should stress treatment as an alternative to incarceration.
Every effort should be made to encourage the federal government to increase formula funding to states for implementation of state drug abuse programs. And certainly, on the other side, the states must dedicate themselves to continuing the programs started by federal funding.
For my part, I pledge to try and convince my colleagues in the Georgia General Assembly of the need for progressive legislation in this area.
[The following content is handwritten on lined paper.]
That can never be easy. Two years ago when an attempt was made in my legislature to decriminalize marijuana, only three of the 180 members voted yea.
In addition to the normal fear Americans have about drugs and those who abuse them, we are facing a general decline, begun 7 years ago, in public support for general social welfare programs.
We face now the national nullification of the needs of the needy, the gratification of the gross and the greedy, the victory of the politics of penuriousness, prevarication pious platitudes and self-righteous swinishness.
We choose leadership and set public policy through a massive manipulation of the American mind which has made the mundane magnificient, and placed government in the hands of men who believe in priviledge for the powerful and neglect of the powerless.
At the same time, some failure in ourselves has caused us to take instruction from the silver screen, and not from home and family, to glorify pimp and pusher.
We can all do better, can build a world without want, where housing and food and health are guaranteed.
It can be done."

2
of the black community is also well-known. A disproportionate number of liquor stores are found in the ghetto. Often they stay open later at night. Through the years, many a senseless homicide in and outside of taverns or at dance halls have occurred in a setting of excessive alcohol consumption. Approximately half of the all American auto fatalities can be traced to one party driving while intoxicated drunk.
We have evidence that over the last few years, barbiturate abuse has become a steadily rising problem among many black teenagers in or out of school. And the teenager on barbiturates is considerably more dangerous to those around him than is the case with other drugs.
While ""speed"" was popularized by the young white drug using subcultures of San Francisco and Los Angeles during the late sixties, serious amphetamine abuse in the black community began ten gto twelve x years earlier.
The only one of the four basic categories of drugs that is not more serious among blacks than whites is the hallucinogen. As a rule, blacks shy away from LSD and drugs of this type. We
3
can only speculate as to why this is the case. Perhaps one reason is that the supply routes are different than with the more traditional drugs: England, the West Coast, the college campus, amateur chemistry labs. Unfortunately, however, there are signs that some of the our more educated brothers who are becoming more integrated into the majority culture, are now beginning to ""drop acid.""
In view of the serious consequences of fact that drug addiction is such a serious menace to the black community, I have in the past, and may again, overreact to the problem. Try and understand why many black Americans, including myself, are Like you, I am more than a little resentful by the incredible national inattention to what has essentially been a black problem -- until the drug problem moved out of the black ghetto and began to threaten the comfortable white suburbs and those curious middle and upper middle class youngsters residing in them.
More than once I have thought that if the larger society had chosen to exert half the effort it is beginning to muster in dealing
4
with illicit drug use when the problem was essentially confined to the ghetto, we might well have had no problem in either community now today. Even today, one gets the impression that the black community is being slighted in the relative attention it receives, particularly in terms of financial support for treatment and education programs.
I must confess to a second reaction to the drug problem. As horrific as it may sound, my immediate impulse to dealing with the problem is to engage in x vigilante action, the sole purpose of which would be to deliver summary punishment to the pusher on the street, to confine the addict until he begs for release, and eliminate what my colleagues in the George General Assembly may consider do-good bleeding heart Eastern liberal reformist programs aimed at coddling addicts. In fact, young some militant groups, such as the Panthers, have begun to give notice that pushers and drug peddlers are enemies and exploiters of black people and that their continual existence will not be tolerated.
While I admit to utter contempt for the pusher with his fine clothes and fancy cars preying on black youths, I am not unsympathetic to the plight of the hopeless youths in our society
5
who are being preyed upon. Typically, the black x youth gets caught up in the drug scene during his late teens and remains a victim the better part of his adult life. Dropping out of school is the usual result, followed by the embarking upon a career of hustling in the street by using his or her wits.
As you well know, a narcotics habit increases in cost the longer one has it. The ten dollar a day habit grows to forty or fifty dollars in a matter of months and it is not infrequent for the addict to spend 75 to 100 dollars a day for heroin. Fantastic amounts of energy, creativity, and intelligent planning are devoted to getting money to pay for one's [habit] habit. Most often this involves illegal pursuits. Many sell drugs to others as a way of making money. The addict ""turning"" drugs does quite well economically, but unfortunately, most of what he makes goes into his own arm.
Contrary to a widely circulated myth, most addicts are brighter than normal. Nevertheless, most eventually do get caught and periodically serve time in prison. The mortality rate of narcotics addicts is several times higher than that for the general population. In addition to themselves, addicts hurt their families. They drain them of their financial resources, lie
6
to them, disappoint them. If small children are involved, they may be severely negliected.
As serious as the situation has been during peak epedemic periods in past years, there is every indication that drug addiction, particularly heroin, is one again on the upswing.
Only a year and a half ago, there were many hopeful signs that the heroin problem was coming under control through the combined efforts of treatment and law enforcement. In most communities, overdose deaths, hepatitis and crime rates were declining after steadily rising for a decade.
But because of the influx of heroin from Mexico and Turkey's renewed opium cultivation, we are finding incresed demand for gtreatment not only in the Southwest, but in Chicago, Philadelphia, and Boston. We are finding further demands for treatment in cities which had not previously reported significant demand.
Combined with new supplies of heroin, is a recessionary economic situation which can only increase the numbers of x jobless, frustrated, hopeless citizens who comprise those groups most susceptible to drug addition. Add to this dismal
7
picture, cutbacks on funding for treatment and drug prevention activities, and the consequences will be disastrous for the entire country.
There is also increasing data to support current hypotheses that heroin use - a a social phenomenon - can be expected to spread in relatively short periods of time from the core of major urban areas to medium-sized and small cities and even into the rural heartland of America.
Obviously, the correct response to this potentially crippling situation is not one of unbriddled outrage and bitterness. But rather one of deliberate, rational, coordn coordinated action on local, state, and federal levels.
Furthermore, it seems to me that an effective strategy for the control of drug addiction must ensure a coordinated plan involving law enforcement, treatment, and prevention or education. A fundamental assumption, however, must be that the drug addict is a sick person and not a criminal. A report of the American Bar Association Committee on Addiction and Crime makes this pof point:
8
""What is needed is a bold new policy which recognizes heroin addiction not as a moral problem to be dealt with through harsh penal sanctions but as a disease for the individual addict and a health crisis for the rest of society. It is a health crisis which must be dealth with principally by hospitals, doctors and clinics, not by police and jasi jails.""

Since the concerns of this group center around treatment and prevention, I would like to stress what I consider to be essential [illegible] factors in developing and operating a successful treatment program.
As I stated earlier, it is my impression that the black community is being slighted in the relative attention it receives particularly in terms of financial support for treatment and education programs.
Since most of the people on methadone todayk are black, the black community should demand assurance that history is not allowed to repeat itself as when heroin was introduced at the turn of the century as the cure for morphine addiction. Being dependent upon [illegible] methadone
9
(or worse, dependent on those who control its distribution) is not a permanently satisfactory state of affairs. At this point no one has a full answer, and all of the programs presently in use deserve support. The community, however, must exert pressure on practitioners and researchers to not be content with partial answers. The government must be forced to fund private community based programs at a level commensurate equal with the way it funds well-established state and university operated programs.
With regard to drug treatment centers, I would give greater attention to placing them in black communities, easily accessible to housing projects those neighborhoods with high concentrations of addicts and marginal youths.
Since drug abuse is a sympton of serious underlying problems, treatment programs must address the factors often recognized as related to drug abuse:such as unemployment, lack of education and training, and inadequate recreational facilities.
Related to this, is the need to coordinate treatment programs with other programs designed to combat xxxx related social problems.
I must also stress the importance of involving community members themselves in the development of their own
10
members themselves in the development of their own drug abuse programs.
And now, let me conclude with some general legislative recommendations. Our elected representatives Those of us who represent you in government must be made aware that drug addiction is a medical problem rather than a legal one and is best handled by avoiding the complications associated with criminalizing the addict. Legislation should stress treatment as an alternative to incarceration.
Every effort should be made to encourage the federal government to increase formula funding to states for implementation of state drug abuse programs. And certainly, on the other side, the states must dedicate themselves to continuing the programs started by federal funding.
For my part, I pledge to try and convince my colleagues in the Georgia General Assembly of the need for progressive legislation in this area.
[The following pages are a copy of handwritten content.]
That can never be easy. Two years ago when an attempt was made in my legislature to decriminalize marijuana, only three of the 180 members voted yea.
In addition to the normal fears Americans have about drugs and those who abuse them, we are facing a general decline, begun 7 years ago, in public support for general social welfare programs.
We face now the national nullification of the needs of the needy, the gratification of the gross and the greedy, the victory of the politics of penuriousness, prevarication pious platitudes and self-righteous swinishness.
We choose leadership and set public policy through a massive manipulation of the American mind which has made the mundane magnificient, and placed government in the hands of men who believe in priviledge for the powerful and neglect of the powerless.
At the same time, some failure in ourselves has caused us to take instruction from the silver screen, and not from home and family, to glorify pimp and pusher.
We can all do better, can build a world without want, where housing and food and health are guaranteed.
It can be done."

In 1941, Black Americans threatened a massive march on Washington if President Roosevelt didn't order desegregation of all federal departments. He did so swiftly, averted a march, and labor leader A. Philip Randolph commented on why the response had been so swift:
""The threat of the March on Washington proved one thing: the Negro gets only what he has the power to take....We have the masses on the street behind us and that gives us the power to make conferences produce something.""
Mr. Randolph's threat in '41 became confrontation and coercion; the streets of the '40s, '50s, and '60s have bwcome become the ballot boxes of the '70s.

The last two-and-one half decades of Black struggle in American life have produced some marvelous victories, often overlooked today as unemployment increasrs increases and the economic system seems near chaos. 
Gains were won at lunch counters and movie theatres and polling places and bus stations and the fabric of legal apartheid in America was destroyed. What had been a movement for civil rights xxxxx has become a political movement, and Black men and women won office and power only dreamed of before. / 
But despite an increase of 150% in the number of Blacks holding office, despite the ability to sit or eat or ride or vote in places that formerly lacked Black faces, in a real way we find our condition unchanged. A quick look at every statistic that measures how well or poorly a group of people is doing - infant mortality rates, median family incomes, life expectancy - shows that while our general condition has improved, our relative condition has actually worsened.
It is almost as though we were climbing a mollasses molasses mountain dressed in snowshoes, wh while everyone else rides a rather leisurly ski-lift to the top. 
Now ths ski slopes are more treacherous and the mollasses molasses melting into mud, a sargasso sea of crime in high places, of joblessness for many and hopelessness for more. 
Yesterday's gains become suspect. The bus front ests seat loses meaning for a people whose longest trip is likely to be from the fuedal system of the rural south to the mechanized, high-rise poverty of the urban north. 
The right to vote loses meaning for a people forced to choose between tweedledum and tweedledee. 
The right to an integrated education can mean little to children bussed from one ignorant academy to another. 
The struggles of the sixties were carried forward against dsicrimination in housing, employment, eeducation and government, both / because the victims became their own best champions and because they found a sympathetic ear in the body politic. 
But as the demands became more strident, as a foreign war drained treasury and manhood, as the best and brightest were beaten down by bullets, a shift occurred in the national consciousness. 
We stand now near our 200th birthday as a people - afraid of what the future will bring and farid afraid to look toc too critically at our past, afraid to assign guilt and responsibility for our common condition.

The Future of the Civil Rights Movement
So much has happened in the United States since the beginning of this decade. The mind literally refuses to negotiate the torturous maze of events that frustrates our will to recall where we xxxx were so that we might assess where we are and predict where we're going for the duration of this century.
A monstrous war slaughtered our young. Even those who survived the bombs and the bullets came home to a country that yawned in their anguished faces. No jobs! No sympathy! Not even a parade! What Johnny came marching home to this time...from Detroit to Dubuque...were pompous politicians begging indulgence for a roaring recession and an overheated, inflationary economy. And guess who was getting burned? /
Watergate become more than an apartment building to live in. Richard Nixon turned it into a shameful nightmare we were forced to live with. More than just a residential-commercial complex crowded against the banks of the Potomac, Watergate came to symbolize for millions of Americans the lengths to which moronic moral midgets will go to cool their Potomac fever.
Our money is becoming counterfeit in world money markets. Our foreign policy bears the stamp of Kissinger's kiss of death. Domestic policy suffers for the lack of any attention at all. Schools no longer educate our young. And our young, knowing nothing, are nodding in the doorways of abandoned cities while hoping things will go better with ""coke"". For Black America, the tentative economic gains of the Sixties are slowly but surely slipping from our grasp. For Black America, it is still true, despite the war on poverty which we apparently lost, that one-third of all Black children still live in poverty...a fact that bodes ill for future Black generations. It is still true that a Black college
 2 5
graduate stands a great chance of earning less money over a lifetime of employment than will a white high school dropout.
After such a hopeful start on domestic problems in America in the Sixties it has seemed over the past five years as if a plague has been visited upon us. And I know it is painful to plunge headloneg back through modern history to view the xxxx stark misery of a people about to enter this decade. But think back with me to the year 1970. Let's think back to where Black America was then so we / can gain some sense of where Black American is likely to be headed.
Let a friend of mine (John Britton) paint the scenario for you as he did in the winter 1974 number of PS(volume VII, No. 1), a quarterly publication of the American Political Science Association. He saw the dawning of a new decade like this, and I quote:
""Black America in 1970 was weary and frustrated. Old targets of its assaults on racial injustice were becoming more elusive and were changing their shapes through clever disguises. Demonstrations for pure civil rights causes resulted in fewer concessions. Charismatic Black leaders, once able to stir national conscience at a command, had gone to the mountaintop. Riots had proved ruinous. Rhetoric was boring. Voices of old allies were raised in eulogy of 'the movement'.
""Cynicism enveloped Black America like a fog, so sure were Blacks that we had been assigned a place near the bottom of the list of national priorities. For (we) Blacks knew that their our aspirations remained unfulfilled, and they we knew that minority participation in the affairs of the nation was still circumscribed by a variety of hostile forces. Not the least of the latter was the notion in white America that litigation and legislation of the Sixties had lifted the Black man's burden; that it was now time to back away from so-called Black programs and to turn with some
3 6
urgency to 'business as usual'.
""But a few Black Americans were not about to release the nation from the commitments it made at the New Frontier and in the Great Society. Too much was possible to tolerate a total retreat from the social, economic and political liberation of Black America. / So its men of letters, its political pragmatists, its street-wise civil rights activists, even some of its more loyal white allies, came at once to a firm resolve: that 1970 was the 1970s could be as good a time as any to rouse the minority community and turn it on to politics and the rewards of political participation.
""This time political participation was to mean more than registering and voting: more than suffering the humiliation of having to choose between xxx two evils at the polls. This time, Black political strategists intended that Black men and women should seek public office on a large scale, attracting broad-based, multi-racial support by an informed and intelligent discussion of issues that cut across ethnic, economic, and political lines.""1
And so it came to pass! Politics and political participation did become the new cutting edge of the Civil Rights Movement, along with the Black economic thrusts that have aimed at liberation on another level. But Black politics has been the more spectacular of the two in growth and influencee.
Since 1969, for example, Black elected officials in America have increased in number by more than 152 percent, or to more than 3200 officeholders. Of that number, more than 120 are mayors of cities and towns. A full one-third of these mayors preside over cities and towns that are nowhere close to being all-Black. And of the top ten cities in America by population, Blacks are mayors of three of them--Los Angeles, Detroit, and Washington, D.C., the / nation's capital; 17 Black
4 7
men and women are seated in the U.S. House of Representatives; one Black man is an influential member of the United States Senate; two Black men are lieutenant governors in states where the Black populations of both do not equal 20 percent, or anywhere near that figure; three hundred Black men and women of are state legislators; almost xxxx 1200 Blacks are members of city councils or county governing bodies; nearly xxx 800 Blacks, if not more, help to determine public educational policy as members of local school boards.
Ten years ago in the South before the Congress passed the Voting Rights Act of 1965, to be Black and to attempt to even register to vote invited punishment, including death, that was guaranteed to be swift, certain and severe. Men and women died, literally died in America, simply petitioning for Blacks to enjoy a basic right that seemed to flow to everybody else from the Constitution of the United States.
[illegible], Today more than half of all Black elected officials in the United States are in the southern states...in the very area where 15 years ago it was not uncommon for Blacks to be asked how many bubbles there are in a bar of soap as a prerequisite for registering. And now there are those of us who are beginning to wonder if a special law is not needed to prod the northern states into the 20th century of Black politics. After all, there are at least seven Black mayors in Alabama, while there is only one in all of New York State; 61 Blacks sit on city council in Mississippi, but there is none on the council in Boston, [illegible] the cradle of liberty.
Yet for all this motion, I would caution you not to draw an assumption that all this represents spectacular progress for Black America. Let's put it into some kind of perspective. The more than 3200 Black elected
[Typeset changes to the same as pages 2 and 3.]
From that day to this, our struggle has been a battle to achieve parity. It comes to climax near year with the selection process for a new president of the United States. 
Prior to that selection there must be developed a rational basis for choosing among the varied dozens that offer themselves to us. 
That in turn means the construction among us of a national movement to insist on on certain basic themse that must be accepted by a candidate acceptable to us. 
They would include: 

income and wealth redistribution through xx a tax structure that reduces the disparity between the needy and the greedy; / 
the elimination of poverty though a program of full employment supplemented by a negative income tax for workers on the margin; 
an educational system that dignifies vocational as well as academic training, and permits each American to realize full potential; 
free, adequate health care for all Americans, financed through the national treasury and not profit making insurance companies; 
effective social control of monopoly, and 
national, regional, or municipal ownership of vital services operated for need and not for profit.

These promise no perfect world, but do hold out the hope that man can create a system of laws and relationships between men that promise more than our present system of priviledge for a few. 
We out to be reminded of some words from Dr. W. E. B. DuBois nearly half a century ago: 
""We are America Negroes. It is beside the point to ask whether we form a real race. Biologically we are mingled of all conceivable elements, but race is psychology, not biology, and psychologically we are a unified race with one history, one red memory, one revolt. It is not ours to argue whether we will be segregated or whether we ought to be a caste. We are segregated; we are a caste. Our problem is: how far and in what way can we / consciously and scientifically guide our future so as to insure our physical survival, our spiritual freedom and our social growth? Either we do this or we die. There is no alternative. If America proposed the murder of our group, its moral decent into imbecility and crime and its utter loss of manhood, self-assertion and courage, the sooner we realize this the better. By that great line of McKay, ""If we must die, let it not be like hogs."" But the alternative of not dying like hogs is not that of dying or killing like snarling dogs. It is rather conquering the world by thought and brain and plan; by expression and organized cultural ideals. Therefore, let us not beat futile wings in impotent frenzy; but carefully plan and guide our segregated life, organize in industry and politics to protect it and expand it. [illegible] What will be, no one knows. It may be a great physical segregation of the world along the color lines; it may be an economic rebirth which insureas spiritual and group integrity amid physical diversity. It may be utter annihilation of class and race and color barriers in one ultimate mankind, differentiated by talent, susceptibility and gift - but any of these ends are matters of long centuries and not years. We live in years, swift, flying, transient years.
We hold the possible future in our hands, but not by wish and will, only by thought, plan and organization.""2

It is traditional at a ceremony like this one to tell you that you are embarking on a great journey through an uncharted sea steering with the compass of your education, sailing under sails raised by your own brilliance, but that, however difficult your course, you are to remember that we are all of us - Black and white, rich and poor young and old all in the same boat.

You are entering into the real world outside of these ebony ivory ivory towers at an interesting time. You are the spiritual descendants of those young people who 11 14 15 years ago, coming from schools very much like this one, demonstrated that young people could make a difference, first at lunch counters and bus stations, then at county courthouses and voting booths all over this dark region of

the country.
Throughout the decade of the '60s, young people the age that most of you are now, faced police dogs and fire hoses and midnight murderers and jails in order to bring a small taste of democracy to this region of the country.
And over these years, a certain sort of progress occurred.
[The rest of the page is crossed with four vertical lines.]
But there is always difficulty in measuring what social scientists call ""progress."" This is particularly true of Black people, because we are a people on a see-saw - we go up in one direction and down in another. 
The 1960s were years of one kind of incredible swift movement for us: we moved from social and political slumber into mild activism into open - if shortlived - rebellion. 
Since the beginning of the last half of that decade, we have struggled through a continuing period of evaluation, attempting
3
to discover not just who we are and where we have come from, but where it is we want to go.
[The rest of the page is crossed with a large X.]
That is a tall question, and its discussion, particularly among the many, many sympathizers and empathizers of the Black movement, occupies more time than the achieving of any goal. 
The trouble is that many people talk about revolution, but do nothing about it: they talk about reform, but do nothing about it.
We live in an age where social activism is measured by whether one wears the right button or can mouth the latest slogan - even former President Nixon can could say ""Power to the people"".
Social concern today is measured by length of your hair or thickness of smoke. America's youth have come to idolize Woodstock while ignoring Watts. 
Human responsibility is measured on a scale which charts whether one adheres to the ""Newton"" or ""Cleaver"" positions, and
4
whether or not you can master the latest intricacies of the latest psuedo-African handshake. Those who used to march militantly in the streets are now running nude on the campus grounds, attempting to demonstrate that all men are not created equal.
But that is not good enough; it simply will not do.
Today's college students and college graduates are direct descendants of an activist generation, a generation that began activism aimed at the question of where one has to sit on a bus or at a lunch counter.
Today, of course, the questions are much more complex, while the direction of too many of the young become altogether too simple.
[Handwritten lines in blue pen here.]
A great deal has been made by some scholars and pollsters of the difference in the demands of Black and white student activists. The more radical whites want revolution, the experts say, while all the Blacks want, despite their revolutionary rhetoric, is reform, a chance to bend the established system to their own ends,
5
which are as safe and as ordinary as those shared by the rest of middle class America.
Therein lies, I think, the dangerous conflict present in the Black mind on the American campus. The Black student is torn between the need for a regular, formal education, part of the socialization process that we are told everyone needs in order to seek an acceptable role in society, and his need to carve out a new education experience, one that is meaningful to him as a Black person.
A young girl, a student at Tougaloo College in Mississippi, summed up this feeling when she wrote of her reaction to learning that Tougaloo and Brown University had entered into an educational compact, with Brown acting as big brother.
""We argued,"" she wrote, ""that Tougaloo could do better, that we did not have to pattern ourselves after Brown or any of the Ivy
6
League schools, that we had a unique opportunity to make Tougaloo a revolutionary institute of learning. We questioned the notion that places like Brown offered a superior education; we felt in fact that they dealt in mid-education. We felt that if schools like Brown had been truly educating their students then the state of the country and the world would be a lot different.""
The dilemma of whether to change the Tougaloos of the world or to get what can be gotten from the Browns is the continuing one among the young Blacks.
The dilemma must be solved if the graduates of today - and all of the future graduates, students, and teachers and administrators at schools like this one are to have a chance at what every oppressed people have always demanded - a chance at having something to say about what is being done to us.
This is the impulse which motivated Cuban canecutters to
7
overthrow Batista: it is the impulse which is directing the quarter-century old successful struggle of the Vietnamese to govern themselves; it is the impulse which will triumph someday is winning today in Angola and Mozambique: it is this impulse which will eventually drive all white South Africans into the sea: and properly channelled, with some direction by trained minds like yours, it is the impulse which will determine whether or not Black people inside this country will live on the margin where we now merely subsist or whether or not we shall have full manhood rights here and now.
As the Tougaloo student I quoted from earlier says, ""The task for Black students and Black Americans is much greater than trying to change white institutions and their white counterparts in the South. The task is to create revolutionary institutes of learning. The act of trying to be a better person, of trying to imagine and create humane institutions is formidable, but we have"

Since the heady days of the 1960's, there slowly grew a coalition of the comfortable, the callous and the smug who closed their ranks, and closed their hearts, against the claims and calls to conscience put forward by the forgotten and unrepresented elements in American society.
It was a triumph for the national nullification of the needs of the needy and the gratituitous gratification of the gross and the greedy, the politics of penuriousness, prevarication and impropriety, of pious platitudes and self-righteous swinishness.
Two elections gave them awesome power. The second, a route that reinstalled the fiscal facists, the merciless merchants of the cost accounting school of social welfarism in the White House, and insured a four year reign for men with an arrogant contempt for people and their problems.
The late American balladeer Woodie Guthrie once said that some men kill with bullets; others with the stroke of a pen.
Coupled with an impotent Congress, the vetoes, cut-backs, shifts in sharing and reverses in revenue cut sharpest at the people at the bottom, those who look to government for help.
If the Kennedy and Johnson years taught any lesson at all, it was that government, under pressure, would move, slowly and ponderously, all too often with all deliberate
3
lack of speed - to become a partner of sorts with the American underclass in their struggle to do better for themselves. The last few years have changed all that. The government's attitude changed from benign concern to malignant neglect.
In the decade of the Sixties, the number of people living in poverty was nearly halved.
It's not unreasonable at all to ascribe some of these gains to the great society programs of the era.
Yet the callous castrators moved with cold calculation to kill, freeze or wind down urban renewal, model cities, community action, public service employment, student loans, public housing, federal impact funds for education, and to impose a sixty percent national pull-back in social services.
Human problems are now placed on a balance sheet and forced to add up: to pay for themselves. The new administrators run the programs they direct with the solicitude of a hungry mortician at an old folks home.
Some frightening figures released by the Census Bureau reveal just how poorly we are doing. On the good side, we are more likely to finish high school than ever before, more than twice as many Blacks go to college, and more Black people are earning more money.
But we are twice as likely as whites to be out of work, three times more likely to live below the poverty line, and
4
just as likely today as we were six years ago to earn half as much money as everyone else does.
The statistical indices which reveal a worsening of the Black condition coincide almost exactly with the beginning of the Nixon presidency.
There are those who say that Black people don’t mention the progress we have made. These figures don’t lie, but they do prove that liars figure.
We are where we are today because of a confluence of events of the Sixties. The nonviolent marchers of the first part of that decade were replaced, if not in fact then certainly in the public fancy, by the rapacious rioters in the last part of the Sixties.
America’s cities were believed to be either in flames, under martial law, or sinking under the dead weight of a population of pensioners, the unemployed young and their presumably unemployable parents.
The rest of America was running from the city in a crisis state of their own. They rightly perceived that their taxes -- higher proportionately than those payed by ITT -- were escalating to pay for barely maintaining what they had run away from, but were wrongly taught – by their president and others – that their taxes were high because of the lazy poor, and not because of the corporate evader or the military glutton.
5
The rulers of the cities, on the other hand – the mayors, commissioners and councilmen – faced an all too common list of plagues we have come to call the urban crisis – drug addiction, increased racial friction, civil service militancy, housing destroyed by plan ""A"" faster than it was constructed by plan ""B""’; schools which warehoused and miseducated their students, relief rolls giving relief to no one. For them the new federalism promised to be manna from heaven.
It promised new money for them all, money to do what they then could not, money to pave the streets, to pay the police, to clean the air and water.
Instead of manna and millions, it became pennies stolen from the poor, robbing Peter to pay Paul half of what Peter couldn’t get by on to begin with.
The result was to shift the burden from the federal government where the resources were to the towns and cities where the resources aren’t.
The municipal managers, forced to choose between funding underfunded program X or Y, chose more often than not to buy votes at the expense of the public good, with tax rebates and fancy hardware.
The administration’s rhetoric about sharing the wealth became a scandalous exercise in consolidating wealth and power where they always were: away from the cities, away from
6
children, away from people for whom wealth is an extra meal, and power the ability to hide from the census taker.
The often repeated connection between today’s dilemma and the end of the Reconstruction era is frightening.
The collusion between a hostile administration and a seemingly unfeeling majority, then and now, seemed to doom the hope of the American underclass.
Then and now, a president desperate for power made an arrangement, not just with the unreconstructed South, but with the national unreconstructed mentality that believes now – as it did then – that private profit and public arrogance could be pursued at the expense of the people living on the American margin.
Concurrently, the liberal crusaders for social justice and democracy became tired, or involved in other, less traumatic concerns. Their courage, guilt and indignation receding as the dark plague came closer to the liberal hearth and home.
The aspirations of and movement by Black people began to be curtailed, not just by organized violence and barbarity, but by a series of national choreographed legal and extra-legal maneuvers designed to make us less than political and economic equals.
7
The frenetic activity of the Sixties created a political movement characterized by selfishness and fear; a political constituency was recruited from the frightened to form solid ranks against the forgotten.
Backlash is too hackneyed a term for people confused by long hair and frightened by clenched fists, their politics misdirected by those who verbally oppose crime in the streets and secretly practice crime in the suites.
This manipulation of the American mind made the mundane magnificant and placed government in the hands of men who believe in privilege for the powerful and neglect of the powerless.
I can think of no better prescription for relieving this crisis, and reviving interest in it, than by creating a partisan national coalition of need, of mothers who want care - not warehousing - for their children, of fathers who want work at a decent wage, of people who work for a living but can't live on what they make as well as those who can't find work but can't live on what we so grudgingly give, those who want an end to welfare and capitalism for the poor and subsidy and socialism for the wealthy and who must learn that sufficiency for people at the bottom can also mean stability for those in the middle: all those people now live in our cities, divided now by race and class, fearful of each other, contentious and impotent.
8
The task becomes one of making the congressional elections of this year turn on commitment to the cities. The conferees gathered here are represented in Congress - with rare exception - by men and women whose commitments are to an earlier era in American history, when farm and field were represented more than alley and expressway.
In the 1972 congressional elections, those Americans who longed for cleaner air and water aimed their sights at members of the U.S. House who placed profits over human pleasure and cleaned house. During most of last year, those forces in America who wanted day care legislation passed, massed their power and saw it through both houses of Congress - only to be thwarted by presidential veto, and give up the ghost.
As long ago as 1966, those people who wanted peace in Vietnam began to organize a political movement that eventually forced a reluctant president to end our involvement there.
Those men and women who favor equality between the sexes have realized that the political process can insure that the Equal Rights Amendment becomes equal rights in fact.
In city after city and state after state, men and women with special axes to bear, have borne down hard on the political process to make it deliver the goods and services it promises.
9
If the Democratic Party is to be a majority party again, it must pull these forces together.
But the people who like clean air can't vote for a man with a dirty heart.
Detente ought not mean just Russia and China, but friendship with Black Africa, too.
If freedom is desirable in Alabama and South Carolina, it is desirable in Angola and South Africa.
The arms race must stop not only because it may cause war, but because the bucks we buy bullets with could buy homes and hospitals for us all.
The party of the people must put people first, not party; principle first, and not partisanship.
That has been tried before, but always by a precious few.
But movements are not built on the helpful motions of a few, but by the determined actions of the many.
It cannot be done by a people who measure their social commitment by the length of their hair or the intricacy of their handshake. It cannot be done by a people who think they can smoke America to her knees.
It will require that rhetoric be turned into action, that schoolbook knowledge be turned toward street situations, that theories be turned into practice.
10
It will require that politics mean people and their problems and not just elections and candidates.
It will require that we build a movement strong enough to take over in a peaceful and orderly fashion, or to take control, following the example of those who now exercise control.
It will require that energies be directed toward proper goals, and will require that men and women refuse to be diverted by fights on the edge of the main struggle. Picking up beer cans by the highway is not a substitute to winning jobs for Black people in the brewery.
The fight against racism, imperialism and war cannot be diverted by rallies against unclean air - the same men who enslave millions of Black people also poison the air. The system which builds cars that are no good when they are two years old is the same system that cannot build jobs or homes for men. The same people who dump industrial garbage into the water have also built and dumped bombs on Vietnam.
When they are successfully brought to task on the one basic issue - man's exploitation of his fellowman - they will be brought to task on all of the others.
Dr. W. E.B. DuBois' belief that the problem of the 20th century would be the problem of the color line was later restated to include the problem of those who have not pitted against those who have.

""I believe in God who made of one blood all races that dwell on earth, I believe that all men, Black and Brown and white, are brothers, varing, through time and opportunity, in form and gift and feature, but differing in no essential particular, and alike in soul and in the possibility of infinite development.
""Especially do I believe in the Negro race, in the beauty of its genius, the sweetness of its soul, and its strength in that meekness which shall inherit this turbulent earth.....
""I believe in the Prince of Peace, I believe that war is murder. I believe that armies and navies are at bottom the tinsel and braggadocio of oppression and wrong: and I believe that the wicked conquest of weaker and darker nations by nations white and stronger but foreshadows the death of that strength.

Whether the name is Vorster or Wallace, Ian Smith or Lester Maddox, the evil is clear.
Part of the ongoing debate among us -- Pan-Africanists, nationalists, integrationists and internationalists -- has been the defining of our struggle in terms applicable to each strain of thought that courses through Black America.
W.E.B DuBois correctly stated that the single problem of the twentieth century would be the problem of the color line.
In those few words he summed up the crisis that has occupied men and nations, and that has become the first order of business for millions of oppressed peoples.
The roots of the crisis are as old as the world itself; the roots involve the continuing failure of the minority of peoples in this world to share wealth and power with the majority of the world's population.
It is a struggle that has broken out on every college campus; it has been taken to the streets of most cities in the country, both violently and non-violently.
It is a part of the struggle that inspired Cuban cane cutters to overthrow dictators, a part of the struggle that inspired Vietnamese peasants to successfully resist 25 years of attempts to dominate their homeland; it is a part of the struggle that inspired Alabama sharecroppers to risk life and limb in order to have a chance at controlling their destiny.
Dr. DuBois believed that scientific and rational study of the problems of race and class would yield rational and logical solutions; civilized man, or educated man, is supposed to solve his problems in a civilized manner, we have all believed.
But the problems of the twentieth century are so vast that many have quite properly been urged to seek uncivilized solutions to them. These problems include the poisoning of the air and water; the rape of the land; the new colonization of peoples, both here and abroad; the new imperialism practiced by Western democracy, and the continuing struggle of those who have not against those who have.
With the birth of the Colossus called the United States, rational and educated men began to believe that civilization stretched to its highest order had begun. Building on a heritage of revolution, expressing a belief in the equality of most, if not all men, this new democracy was to be the highest elevation of man's relations, one to the other, and a new beginning of decency between nations.
Civilization, as it was then defined, included imposing limitations on war between nations, encouraging the spread of industrialization, the civilizing of so-called heathen elements, the harnessing of nature for the benefit and pleasure of man. It was generally believed that man's better nature would triumph over his base desire to conquer and rule and make war, and that intellect, reason and logic would share equally with morality in deciding man's fate.
Of course it has not been so. Man still makes war, he still insists that one group subordinate its wishes and desires to that of another, he still insists on gathering material wealth at the expense of his fellows and his environment.
Men and nations have grown arrogant, and the classic struggle of the twentieth century continues.
The educated peoples of this world have enslaved the uneducated; the rich have dominated the poor; the white minorities have crushed the non-white peoples of the globe.
Revolutionary nations -- revolutionary 200 years ago -- have turned to counter-revolutions.
This country, after visiting death on thousands of Vietnamese, has found the arrogance to ignore the centuries of pleading from her own domestic colony, the Blacks.
When these pleadings are dismissed, then the problem of the twentieth century comes to the fore, and violence is done to the notion that men can solve their problems without it.
In the remainder of the 1970's the theme of the struggle is likely to be violence. We have already seen ample evidence of what sort of violence has been visited on the oppressed people of the world for centuries. We are likely in the future to see increasing answers in violence from those who have been on the receiving line all too often.
We need to re-define who is, and who isn't, violent in America.
Violence is Black children going to school for 12 years and receiving five years of education.
Violence is 30 million hungry stomachs in the most affluent nations on earth.
Violence is a country where property counts more than people.
Violence is an economy that believes in socialism for the rich and capitalism for the poor.
Violence is 6,000 American farmers receiving $25,000 each not to farm.
But an antidote to that violence exists; the antidote was begun with Denmark Vesey and Nat Turner, was given impetus by DuBois and the Niagara movement; was spurred by Martin Luther King, Jr. and thousands of nameless fighters for freedom. It is a movement that at times has attracted mass following, but which has all too often been the province of a few.
But movements are not built on the helpful motions of a few, but by the determined actions of the many.
The chance at power comes in this country, not from seizing a dean, but from seizing a welfare office, from organizing a strike of domestic workers, from beginning the process of transferring strength and power from those who have to those who do not.
This is not easy work. It is not easy because no one wants to do it. In an era of doing your own thing, no one wants to do for and with those whose thing is becoming, winning, and retaining the right to live.
It will require more than just the commitment of summer soldiers, although any soldiers are welcomed into an understaffed army.
It will require serious and systematic allocations of time and energy and resources.
It will require that rhetoric be turned into action, that schoolbook knowledge be turned toward street situations, that theories be turned into practice.
It will require that politics means people and their problems and not just elections and candidates.
It will require that we build a movement strong enough to take over in a peaceful and orderly fashion, or to take control, following the example of those who now exercise great power.
It will require that energies are directed toward proper goals, and will require that men and women refuse to be diverted by fights on the edge of the main struggle.
The fight against racism, imperialism, and war cannot be diverted by campus rallies against unclean air -- the same men who enslave millions of Black people also poison the atmosphere. The system which builds cars that are no good when they are two years old is the same system that builds no jobs and no homes for men. The same people who dump industrial garbage into the water have also built and dumped bombs in Vietnam.
When they are successfully brought to task on the one basic issue -- man's exploitation of his fellowman -- they will be brought to task on all of the others.
That suggests there will be no peace. The oppressed of this land will not let peace prevail, until they are given power or until they are destroyed by it.
When the day of judgement comes, we shall each have to add up our marks. Those who sat idly by and did nothing until that day shall be the first to go.
But it will eventually consume us all. As the old spiritual says, ""God gave Noah the rainbow sign, no more water, the fire next time."" What is needed is a new kind of commitment.
In our terms, it means the kind of commitment from young people that would have kept the South in ferment from the heady days of 1964 until the present: it is the kind of commitment from our young that takes over the dean's office one day, but the welfare office the next; the kind of commitment that will mean year round participation in a new politics, a people's politics, a politics that will insure a choice, and not an echo, at the top of the ballot in November, 1976.
And it will require that each of us keep in mind a prophecy written by the late Langston Hughes, -- that dreams deferred do explode. For if this dream is deferred much longer, then an explosion will come.
Dr. W.E.B. DuBois' belief that the problem of the twentieth century would be the problem of the color line was later restated to include the problem of those who have not pitted against those who have.
Despite the glorious figures of the past, and some few shining examples in the present -- some minor political power, economic affluence held by some few Black people -- Black people in America, like Black people everywhere, live on the edge of catastrophe daily. We know -- as you know in your towns and cities everywhere -- that all too often we exist at the pleasure of others, for their entertainment, or exist at all because we do not yet bother them enough to have them destroy us all.
Some of those people like to compare their situation with ours, and to exclaim that since they made it, why can't we?
We all know the answers. To be sure, we all came to this country as immigrants. Unlike us, however, they came as voluntary immigrants. They were not separated from their homeland at the point of a gun. They did not see child torn from mother, wife from husband. They did not have language and culture destroyed. They did not have a strange and alien religion forced upon them.
They imported here a system of mercantile capitalism geared to their cash-box mentality, while we, used to communalism and the extended family, found our very right to form families forbidden and our labor, skills and intelligence stolen to fatten other people's pocketbooks and to extend the crooked beak of the American eagle into the affairs of other people across the globe.
But we survived. We endured, we struggled, we persisted, we tried to overcome, and we are now at an important point in our history here. Important because for the last several years there has been intense debate in our community -- locally, nationally and internationally -- about how to continue our struggle.
That difficulty arises, I believe, because we have struggled so hard in the past for gains and benefits that fitted other people's agendas, and only marginally fitted ours.
We struggled for the rights of workingmen, as we should have, but as working men grew more affluent and powerful in this country, they closed us out.
We joined the struggle for the rights of women long before the Civil War, as well as we might have, but the daughters of the American Revolution are not our friends.
We struggled against the illegal rape of Vietnam by this country, as well we might, but the American peace movement did not return that friendship in kind.
We struggled for a more equitable distribution of goods and services in this country, as well we might, but our enemy is not the class system alone.
Even some environmentalists have told us that Black people must sacrifice our chance at jobs and income so the air and water can be cleaned up. Good government forces tell us that our chances at political sovereignity must wait because good government dictates a dilution of our votes.
We must strive for a unity that will not stifle the natural desires of each of us -- in his or her own way -- to forward the movement of Black people, but will halt the kind of divisiveness that hinders us all.
That kind of unity suggests that it is a luxury for us to debate the relative revisionism of the late Ho Chi Minh. It suggests that the supposed and alleged security of the college campus is not the proper place from which to engage in social criticism of people who seldom see any book but the Bible from year to year. It suggests that the old dream of uniting the boys on the block with the bourgeoise dressed in black must be made a reality.
Let me close with two selections from that great African, Dr. DuBois, two statements from that masterful mind written 37 years apart, the first from the Crisis in 1921, and the second from his message to the All-African Conference in 1958. He begins:
The growth of a body of public opinion among peoples of Negro descent broad enough to be called Pan-Africanism is a movement belonging almost entirely to the twentieth century.
Seven hundred and fifty years before Christ, the Negroes as rulers of Ethiopia and conquerors of Egypt were practically supreme in the civilized world; but the character of the African continent was such that this supremacy brought no continental unity; rather, the inhabitants of the narrow Nile Valley set their faces toward the Mediterranean and Asia more than the western Sudan, the valley of the Congo and the Atlantic.
From that time even to the rise of the Sudanese kingdoms of the 13th, 14th and 15th centuries, there was still no Pan-Africa; and after that the slave trade brought continental confusion ........
As a boy I knew little of Africa save legends and some music in my family. The books which we studied in the public school had almost no information about Africa, save Egypt, which we were told was not Negroid. I heard of a few great men of Negro blood, but I built up in my mind a dream of what Negroes would do in the future even though we had no past.
For 400 years Europe and North America have built up their civilization and comfort on theft of colored labor and the lands and materials which rightfully belong to these colonial peoples. The dominant exploiting nations are willing to yield more to the demands of masses of men than were their fathers. But their yielding takes the form of sharing the loot; not of stopping the looting. ........ Either capital belongs to all or is denied to all.
Here then, my brothers, you face your great decision. Will you for temporary advantage -- automobiles, refrigerators, Paris gowns -- spend your income in paying interest on borrowed funds?
...........................
This is the great dillema which faces Africans today, faces one and all. Give up individual rights for the needs of mother Africa; give up tribal independence for the needs of the nation.
Awake, awake, put on thy strength, oh Zion! Reject the weakness of missionaries who teach neither love nor brotherhood, but chiefly the virtues of private profit from capital, stolen from your land and labor. Africa, awake! Put on the beautiful robes of Pan-African socialism.
You have nothing to lose but your chains.
You have a continent to regain.
You have freedom and human dignity to attain."

None is entirely satisfactory, and none is sure to guarantee maximum political benefit.
Nearly since the institution of the Presidency itself, Black Americans have tried to influence both the selection and election processes.
The most recent candidacies of Dick Gregory and Eldridge Cleaver in 1968 and Congresswoman Shirley Chisholm in 172 1972 are but two examples of Black attempts to put some color into the White House.
None of these can be called anything near successful; Cleaver and Gregory together polled less than ..... 1% of the vote, and Mrs. Chisholm received arrived with fewer than ..... 35 delegate votes at the 1972 Democratic Convention.
In other years - and even as these Black candidates were running, politically minded Blacks tried in a variety of ways to be heard and listened to in Presidential election years.
That qualifyer - ""politically mind Blacks"" is important. Not all Black people seem to care who succeeds Nixo Gerald Ford, for fewer than .....% more than 40% of the eligible Black voters in the United States are not registered today.
In 1972, fewer than .....% 50% of the total American electorate voted; in 1974's congressional elections, the figure dropped to .....% less than that.
The recent history of Black political participation in America has shown than while Southern Black people have generally registered and voted in increasing proportion over the last ten years since passage of the voting rights act, Blacks living North of the Mason Dixon line and West of the Mississippi have declined in both voting and registration.
Whether this decline in general and Black participation is because of

apathy or alienation are subjects for another day - it is sufficient to note that proportionately fewer of us will be appear to be willing or able to decide who will occupy the home at .....1600 Pennsylvania Avenue in 1976 than at any time in the last several years.
With these qualifications noted, our options are these:

support one of the several announced or soon to be announced candidates in either party. In practice, this means choosing one of the several Democrat candidates and attempting to get all Black voters to choose him, since no more than 13% of the national Black electorate identified with the Republican party in 1972.

What is likely to happen will be a combination of all of the above. Nearly each one of the announced Bl ck candidates can democstrate some Black support, even the mental and moral midget from Alabama. A serious move is already afoot by some Blacks to seek out coalitions with whites and with other minorities to field an independent candidate in 1976.
Two other possibilities present themselves. In 1972, the Congressional Black Caucus drew up an agenda, and tried to measure all candidates against it. Even though one of their own was a candidate, most of them support the eventual nominee  Such an attempt ought to be made again, if only to have a standard by which to

judge all candidates. Such an attempt will fail, however, if as in the past, personal loyalties and private arrangements are allowed to by-pass objective judgements measured against a common standard.
In both 1968 and 1972, I attempted to encourage what I called ""favorite son or daughter"" candidates. In many of the eleven or more secret and not-so-secret meetings held by Black political activists around the country, I argued that such a strategy would maximize Black political potential at the Democratic Party Convention. It would allow political figures well known in their states to compete only in their states for Black votes - and probably win them - without having the to mount the an supremely expensive a prohibitively expensive national campaign.
If these candidates were to agree on a single platform, the new delegate selection rules almost guarantee they could effectively command a major portion of Black votes at the 1976 convention. Once there, if they can could subvert the ordinary human ambition which in Presidential years makes nonentities believe they have been chosen by God to lead America, they might successfully bargain with white candidates to wrest some real concessions for Black America.
Our final difficulty comes in enforcing concessions once made, even those sealed in blood. Like other Americans in 1960, I was encouraged by candidate John F. Kennedy's criticism of the Nixon - Eisenhower civil rights policies, and his promise that housing discrimination could be eliminated ""with a the stroke of a pen.""

What will be our strategy, then. What will we do, as a group, or as ...millionsof individuals occupying every station in life, and [sharing] holding every position on the political scale?

None is entirely satisfactory, and none is sure to guarantee maximum political benefit.
Nearly since the institution of the Presidency itself, Black Americans have tried to influence both the selection and election processes.
The most recent candidacies of Dick Gregory and Eldridge Cleaver in 1968 and Congresswoman Shirley Chisholm in 1972 are but two examples of Black attempts to put some color into the White House.
None of these can be called anything near successful. Cleaver and Gregory together polled less than 1% of the vote, and Mrs. Chisholm arrived with fewer than 35 delegate votes at the 1972 Democratic Convention.
In other years -- and even as these Black candidates were running, politically minded Blacks tried in a variety of ways to be heard and listened to in Presidential election years.
2
That qualifier -- ""politically minded Blacks"" -- is important. Not all Black people seem to care who succeeds Gerald Ford, for more than 40% of the eligible Black voters in the United States are not registered today.
In 1972, fewer than 50% of the total American electorate voted. In 1974's congressional elections, the figure dropped to less than that.
The recent history of Black political participation in America has shown that while Southern Black people have generally registered and voted in increasing proportion over the last ten years since passage of the Voting Rights Act, Blacks living North of the Mason-Dixon line and West of the Mississippi have declined in both voting and registration.
Whether this decline in general and Black participation is because of apathy or alienation are subjects for another day. It is sufficient to note that proportionately fewer of us appear to be willing or able to decide who will occupy the home at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue in 1976 than at any time in the last several years.
With these qualifications noted, our options are these:
3

Support one of the several announced or soon-to-be-announced candidates in either party. In practice, this means choosing one of the several Democrat candidates and attempting to get all Black voters to choose him, since no more than 13% of the national Black electorate identified with the Republican party in 1972. (It is interesting to note that the '72 figures represented a 100% increase over 1968, a figure largely attributed to the Nixon Administration's skill at using federal dollars to purchase Black support.)
Split Black support between several ""liberal"" candidates, probably Democrats. This strategy has been informally in effect in Democratic primaries in the last three presidential elections, at least. Black support in California in 1972 split nearly evenly between Humphrey and McGovern, for example.

Negroes are almost entirely a working people. There are pitifully few MNegro millionaires and few employers. Our needs are identical with labor's needs -- decent wages, fair working conditions, liveable housing, old age security, health and welfare measures, conditions in which families can grow, have education for their children and respect in the community . . . . The two most dynamic and cohesive forces in the country are the labor movement and the Negro freedom movement.

Since that time more than a decade ago, many changes have occurred in the movement for political and economic justice among Black people.
2
Many of the goals pressured for by Dr. King and others in the early sixties are a reality now.
The historic discrimination against Blacks at places of public accommodation has been removed.
The right to register and vote and to participate in developing public policy is now well established.
The number of Black elected officials in the South has risen by over 2,000% since the beginning of the '60s.
More of us are finishing high school now than ever before; more are in college. More are making $10,000.00 a year now than ever before.
But these gains, while important, are often illusory. The right to eat at the lunch counter may leave stomach filled but pocketbook empty without a decent job.
The gains in registration and elected officials are impressive. But the 1,307 Black elected officials serving today in the eleven states of the Old Confederacy represent only two percent of the total number of office holders throughout the South.
3
Over 50% of the potential Black electorate is not registered.
The educational gains many have made are not always easily translated into economic improvement. The average Black college graduate four years ago, for example, earned only as much money as the average white high school graduate.
So the Black community appears to take three steps forward and two back, winning here and losing there.
Let us begin by stating that the United States of America, at the middle of the decade of the 1970s, is a colonial society, with almost all Black people being colonial subjects, and almost all white people, willingly or not, consciously or not, being colonialists.
The first fact is sure to be disputed by some. The second cannot be, for even the Kerner Commission report, the official establishment statement on the crisis of race in America, stated that ""What white Americans have never fully understood -- but what the Negro can never forget -- is that white society is deeply implicated in the ghetto. White institutions created it, white institutions maintain it, and white society condones it.""1
4
But the colonial status of America's Black people has seldom received such recognition. On the contrary, it is argued that since Blacks in this country are ""American"" and not ""foreign"", since we have equal Constitutional rights with white people, and since we are not the traditional source for raw material and cheap labor that a colonial people are, then the analysis must be faulty, and the traditional solution -- revolution -- is unthinkable here.
It is true that we are American, at least by birth, partly by language and partly by culture. We came here as immigrants, as did most other Americans, but unlike all of them, we came as involuntary immigrants. When the European immigrants arrived, they gained an immediate -- if low level -- economic foothold by providing the unskilled labor needed by industry. The first Black immigrants -- the slaves -- provided needed labor to be sure, but at no profit whatever to themselves. When they finally arrived in the city, they found a developed economy with little use for them except as consumers. Even before then, the system of chattle slavery destroyed African cultures and the African family, imposed a strange and alien religion on an already religious people, while the Europeans drew their political and
5
economic strength from the traditions and religion they preserve to this day. As slavery passed, Black people entered into a permanent status of under-employment, while the Europeans thrived in an expanding economy and the growing age of entrepreneurial opportunities.
It is certainly a fact that Black Americans and white Americans enjoy equal Constitutional status, at least in popular theory, although some of the rights every schoolboy knows to be guaranteed in the Constitution -- like the right to vote -- are still the subject of intense argument, not just in the unreconstructed South, but in the halls of the United States Congress as well. But the class position of most Black people, complicated and colored by the fact of race in a society dominated politically, economically, and socially by whites, makes the usual Constitutional guarantees almost worthless except in certain situations. The right to belong to a labor union means little to domestic workers; welfare clients have little to do with the rules governing them. The resident of the inner city has no power -- except that of force and fear -- over the police who occupy his neighborhood.
It is true that Black people in American life offer no source of raw materials, and increasingly, in a technological
6
and ever more automated society, offer no source of cheap labor either, a fact from which only the most terrifying conclusions can be drawn. It can be argued that under traditional forms of colonialism, the colonized people enjoyed a respite from fears of genocide because they were needed to make the colonial equation add up for the occupying power. Under this new form, in which the colonial subjects become a useless and surplus people, what is to prevent genocide or a new slavery, if the ruling powers become too irritated at the slaves' demands?
The single conclusion drawn must be that the solutions that have worked in integrating and assimilating the Europeans into the American mainstream cannot -- and some would say -- should not be used in the case of American Blacks.
The processes which elevated Europeans -- hard work, self-help, ethnic identification, political activism, economic separatism, intellectual striving -- can at best by themselves marginally improve the conditions of the mass of Black people in America.
Thus through the adoption of these techniques, Black Americans have won the right to be accommodated in public places, to use the franchise in most parts of the country, to sue for
7
equal educational opportunities, to peacefully protest injustice, and to peacefully petition government for a redress of grievances, the latter one of the Constitutional rights only recently secured -- and then at great cost and then not completely -- by Black people.
So while American society has always presented the opportunity for some Blacks to rise to positions of influence and affluence, and while society presently presents an opportunity for general -- if minimal -- improvements to be won through traditional channels, it has not yet shown any indication or willingness to change its 300 year old history of exploitation and suppression based on race and an economic system that has always believed that property is more important than people. What further complicates that possibility of such change is that the discussion of it has become so cloudy and unreal.
The tragedy in the United States' relation with her colonial subjects, both here and abroad, is that we have always chosen the preservation of order rather than the risk of reform. That is the history of our involvement in Vietnam where brutal, anti-democratic -- but importantly, anti-communist -- regimes are supported, and that is the history at home, where reformist efforts are at the last minute always halted when order is threatened.
8
Thus the reports of commissions into the riots of 1919, of 1935, of 1943, of the Watts rebellion appear as "" A kind of Alice in Wonderland -- with the same moving picture shown over and over again, the same analysis, the same recommendations, and the same inaction."" 2
For Black people, the way out of this colonial status seems clear. First, an analysis that suggests that the social system, as organized, is both incapable of solving the problem and at the same time, is a part of the problem and cannot be appealed to or relied upon as an independent arbiter in conflicts of which it is a part. Next, we must assume that most white Americans lack the will, courage and intelligence to voluntarily grant Black Americans independence, and that Black Americans must be forced to do it by pressure.
We must also assume: 3
1) that people do not discriminate for the fun of it, but that the function of prejudice is to defend special interests (social, economic, political and psycho-logical) and that appeals to the fair play of prejudiced people are like prayers
9
said to the wind.
2) that colonial patterns will change, and colonists will relinquish power if they are forced to make a clear cut choice between continuance of the colonial relationship and another clear cut and highly cherished value -- economic gain or civil peace.
3) that conflict and struggle and confrontation are necessary for social change, and
4) that the rights and lives of real human beings are at stake, and these are in the long run, neither ballotable nor negotiable; that such negotiation, to be meaningful, must take place between equals acting in good faith -- if not the good sense -- of white Americans.
For white Americans, the question becomes whether they can give up the benefits -- economic profit, political power,
10
social status and psychological rewards -- that are derived from the status quo.
[Blue handwritten mark in the right margin.] + The fight against discrimination -- in employment, in housing and education -- accelerated in the decade of the '60s as the victims became their own champions, but now the times require an end to economic discrimination as well.
This last is a movement whose time has surely come, a movement which will demand national planning, the replacement of corporate advantage with social -- welfare priority -- in short, the extension of democracy to every single sphere of political and economic life.
If there is an alternative to a government that believes in welfare socialism for Lockheed Aircraft and fiscal facism and capitalism for the poor, it is to be found in the 1976 elections.
The President, each one of the 435 members of the United States house, one third of the members of the United States Senate, many of the nation's 50 Governors and hundreds of state Assemblymen, Mayors, Councilmen and Commissioners are up for election next year.
The President has used his veto as a weapon against the weak; his co-conspirators have been the new, so-called liberal
11
members of Congress who lack the testicular fortitude to over-ride him or improve our lives. They must be among the first to go.
If the people of this country who work for their living and do not live on the wages of others: the parents who want schooling and care -- not just warehousing -- for their children, the workers who want work at a decent and protected wage, the veterans who want medical treatment, the workers who want maximum minimums, -- if all these people can be made to see their common interest, then the tide can turn.
That means developing a multi-issue oriented electorate that will insist that candidates take more than one right position. Those of you who believe in clean water ought not support a man with a dirty heart. If your candidate is right on rivers but imperfect on people, you must make him right on people, too.
Building such a movement is an old and rather faded dream. Its chances of success have never been easy: its difficulties have always been immense, but its necessity has never been greater.
How do we begin? We demand transformation of society through immediate structural reforms. The following proposals could be in a transitional program:
12

income and wealth redistribution, through a tax structure that progressively reduces the disparity between the affluent and the poor.
a genuine full employment policy, combining stimuli to housing and public works construction, to be triggered by 2%, not 6%, unemployment.
the elimination of poverty, primarily by full employment supplemented by a negative income tax for economically marginal vocations.
national workforce planning, with publicly funded job training, retraining, and relocation, when voluntarily sought.
an educational system that dignifies vocational as well as academic training and permits each person to identify and realize his or her full productive and individual potential. 
13

adequate health care for every American, financed through the national treasury, not private insurance.
decent, affordable housing for every American.
maximum agricultural production to assure every American a nutritionally adequate diet, with surplusses purchased by the government for food grants to alleviate world hunger.
national, regional, or municipal ownership and operation of vital services for need, not profit, including an adequate rail passenger system.
effective social control, whether by public ownership or break-up, of monopolistic corporations (including multi-nationals) which restrict public or consumer options.
employee and consumer representation
14
on the governing boards of all major industries, and public disclosure of pertinent financial and operational data.

delivery of government service on the basis of need.

There is no utopia. I offer concepts, not detailed blue-prints, because our political drive must focus on the real issues -- power, wealth, and human needs -- if we are to move toward a more human society. To look backwards to a competitive golden age is to surrender our future to private greed, to increasing concentrations of wealth and power, and to the continuing economic crisis to which the unchecked race for growth and profit subjects us.
It will take hard work to promote such a program, to register voters, to educate them to their interests, and to turn them out on election day.
Let me leave you with some words from Dr. W.E.B. DuBois, who, some forty years ago, spelled out the task that lies ahead for educated men and women:
Biologically, we are mingled of all
15
conceivable elements, but race is psychology, not biology, and psychologically, we are a unified race with one history, one red memory, and one revolt.
It is not ours to argue whether we will be segregated or whether we ought to be a caste. We are segregated; we are a caste.
Our problem is: how far and in what way can we consciously and scientifically guide our future as to insure our physical survival, our spiritual freedom and our social growth? Either we do this or we die. There is no alternative. If America proposed the murder of this group, its moral descent into imbecility and crime and its utter loss of manhood, self assertion and courage, the sooner we realize this, the better.
By that great line of McCay, ""If we must die, let it not be like hogs."" But the alternative of not dying like hogs is not that of dying and killing like snarling dogs. It is rather
16
conquering the world by thought and brain and plan; by expression and organized cultural ideals.
Therefore, let us not beat futile wings in impotent frenzy, but carefully plan and guide our segregated life, organize in industry and politics to protect it and expand it. . . .
What will be, no one knows. It may be a great segregation of the world along the color line; it may be an economic rebirth which insures spiritual and group integrity amid physical diversity. It may be utter annihilation of class and color barriers in one ultimate mankind, differentiated by talent, susceptibility and gift -- but any of these ends are matters of long centuries and not years.
We live in years -- swift, flying, transient years.
We hold the possible future in our hands, but not by wish and will, only by thought, plan, knowledge and organization."

At another occasion, an invitation to speak before a New England Jewish Congregation was challenged by members who thought my statements in favor of a homeland for Palestinian Arabs -- outside Israel's 1967 borders -- constituted anti-Semitism.
At another time, representatives of a national Jewish organization threatened to cut me of from ""Jewish money"" if I wouldn't ""understand"" the correctness
2
of the Israeli point of view.
Finally, a cause with which my name is linked -- having nothing to do with international politics -- goes begging for support because a New York Times essay links my alleged anti-Zionism with anti-Semitism, and scores of Jews write in to ask that their names be removed from our mailing list. [Written in margin: Why not identify it?] 
Black people understand this paranoia well. We know that those who oppose our efforts for whatever picayune reason often hide their blatant bias behind transparent objections to tactics or timeliness. [Written in margin: This weakens the argument by introducing another issue. I would either omit or develop it a bit further] 
We know that thin lines separate us from a return to the terror of yesteryear, when midnight riders and governmental conivance kept us subservient and afraid. We know that white America stands ready to return to past practices at a moment's imagined provocation. Most of us, however, still do not condemn all white people because many share sentiment with Bilbo and Eastland. Most Black people do not harbor anti-white feelings because housewives in Boston echo their counterparts in Little Rock years ago. Most of us do not hate Jews because George Wallace sports ""a Jew"" to demonstrate his conversion to 19th Century ideals. [Written in margin: Good]
Most of us do not hold racial or ethnic or religious groups responsible for the vicious and greedy excesses of a few of their number, and we resent those who demand our allegiance to one cause as a precondition for their support of another, [nor] as do most Americans of any race or religion. [The following marginal note brackets this paragraph and concludes on the bottom of page 3: My major criticism of this entire piece, Julian, is that it links two issues each of which needs to be treated on its own, & in this particular paragraph you link them in a single sentence. My style would be to focus on]
Perhaps we long for a world too ideal, which judges causes by their merit, and not by the political positions of their endorsers.
Until that day comes round, might we ask for support for our versions of
3
our liberation on its respective merits, and not on the international political coloration of its sponsors? If that cannot be done, then we might as well quit this charade, and admit we suspect each other too much to build the world that guarantees the celebration of our differences.
[The following continues the handwritten note from the bottom of page 2.]
the Arab/Israeli issue exclusively. However, it is O.K. to also bring up the question of anti-Semitism by a few blacks, but it should be treated as a totally separate topic. Otherwise, you weaken the main argument. And, in my opinion, you weaken it even further by getting in your hints about folks just using your pro-Arab statements as excuses for not giving. If this essay is to be a mailing to win back the support of those who asked to have their names deleted, then you probably won't win any who are 'just making an excuse', & you may alienate some others.
But all have our own style! (Actually, I would probably be much more forthright than you are in stating that support for the just rights of Palestinians has nothing to do with Anti-Semitism or with southern elections, but you are obviously more diplomatic than I, as evidenced by your popularity. 
It was great to see you last week. Tell the boys to come up & be water boys on Aug 19-21.

Copyright, 1975
Julian Bond
It is impossible to over-emphasize the power of the media. It is the central nerve of the nation. It influences the way we look at the world. More importantly, it influences the way we look at ourselves. Its impact is felt on virtually every aspect of American life—the way we relate to each other, the way we educate our children, our relationship to our environment, who we elect to public office, and what we eat. 
Surveys tell us that almost every home in the United States has at least one television or radio set, which when combined, account for the bulk of the average American's leisure time. 
We also know It’s well known that [illegible] journalism generally has been shockingly backward in seeking out, hiring, training and promoting Blacks. This tradition of discrimination against Blacks in the media has been largely responsible for the absence of Black faces in city rooms and on television screens. 
Radio—at least AM—has been a slightly different story. Richard Kahlenberg wrote in 1966 that ""Due to the nature of American broadcasting (and he was talking mainly about radio), Negroes have found their 
3
way into the industry's purview as performers and sought-after listeners, primarily for economic reasons."" 
He added, ""Very seldom are broadcast owners, white or Negro, seeking to use radio for special pleading or agitation on behalf of the Negro. Indeed, far from being a medium for communicating a specifically Negro viewpoint to a white audience, radio has become, because of its commercial nature, a medium by which the white establishment, through advertising, is actually seeking to sell its values to the Negro."" 
During radio's pre-television heyday of the 1930's and early 1940's, local and network broadcasters relegated anywhere from one to three hours a day to Black audiences. On local stations, this usually took the form of recorded blues or spiritual music programs, open with white disc jockeys. On Sundays, religious programming included live broadcasts of Black church services or gospel singers. From time to time, Black talent was featured on radio broadcasts. During the thirties, Count Basie's national popularity was aided in this way. 
Meanwhile, the national networks continued portraying us as ignorant and shiftless in radio comedies such as ""Amos 'n' Andy""
4
and ""The Beulah Show."" 
Post-war radio, as yet then unaffected by television, attempted to appeal to all age groups, rather than specializing as most radio stations do today. Therefore, early Black radio was patterned largely after its general market counterparts.  
Likewise, the radio announcer most likely was a jack-of-all-trades. He broadcast news, wrote commercials, planned special events, conducted interviews. 
As Americans switched to television for entertainment and information during the early fifties, radio was forced to change radically. That change took the form of specialty radio and gave rise to the all-rock, all-jazz, all-classical, all-talk stations.  
To enterprising executives aware of the Black surge in economic power, the all-Black station was a logical specialty. Black-oriented radio spread rapidly in the fifties—first in the North and Midwest, then throughout the South. 
Since the boom of the fifties, the basic format on Black-oriented radio has changed very little—several consecutive rhythm-n-blues or soul recorded music programs throughout the
5
broadcasting day, interrupted by one or two newscasts every hour, maybe a recorded gospel music broadcast and religious programming on Sundays. So, Black radio listeners—no matter their our age or preference—find only one type of outlet aimed specifically at them us.  
One young Black critic of the medium, William Wright, asked, ""Do we need 24 hours of James Brown?"" 
Answering his own question, he said, ""No, we don't. If we're going to talk about freedom and self-determination, we need to hear our Black heroes performing in other art forms. We need to talk about drug addiction, about slum landlords, about jobs, about education. But the white man gives us 24 hours of soul because it pads his already stuffed pockets and keeps Black people ignorant."" 
White radio reformers concur with this charge of exploitation, not only in soul radio but in general. A circular issued by the National Citizens Committee for Broadcasting, blasted what it considers the industry's ""contempt for the public interest"" and ""over commercialization, by which the broadcasters so shamefully exploit even our children.""
6
Another reform agency, Citizens Communication Center charges in its statement of purpose, ""The broadcast industry often has not understood -- or has chosen to ignore -- the programming tastes and requirements of broad portions of the (viewing) public.""
Soul radio executives defend their practices by insisting they give their listeners only what the listeners want. If it also happens to be profitable, so what?
My quarrel is not with soul the music, which I happen to enjoy. My quarrel is with the broadcasters who could offer information and public service without disturbing their profits. The white broadcasters who have brainwashed us into accepting nothing but soul, and are creating a soul music mentality among Black youths. 
It might be useful to recall the words of former F.C.C. Commissioner Nicholas Johnson, who spoke at N.A.T.R.A.'s speakingin 1968: convention in Miami, ""When your listeners are crying out to understand and to be understood, and you keep on spinning the top forty, you may literally find yourself a modern day electronic [illegible] Nero, playing fiddle music while your own Rome burns."" 
Today, white management, newly arrived black executives,
7
I am encouraged to see more and more Black announcers expressing this kind of candor on the air and becoming behind-the-scenes reformers. Across the country, Black disc jockeys are joining labor unions and striking against their employers for higher wages and better working conditions. Many leak information against their employers to newspapers and civic organizations. No longer fearful of possible consequences, Black radio announcers now use the retaliatory dismissal of a co-worker as a reason to step up their militancy against recalcitrant employers.
The Black ""jack-of-all-trades"" is also vanishing, more and more Blacks are specializing like their white counterparts. But we still have a long way to go. By the time a Black employee finally gets a contract for a $35 a month raise in pay he is often still well below what his white colleagues are getting at other stations.
Newsweek magazine reported in 1967 that ""while the money in Black-oriented radio is green, the power is strictly white. . . . there is just one Negro station manager and few top Negro executives; on many stations, only the disc jockeys and janitors are Black.""
8
That situation has thankfully changed, but for years, Black employees at white-owned facilities advanced to music director, religious program director, or other positions with no executive-level power at most stations. The rare soul station that boasted any kind of news-gathering and compilation system also usually hired a white news director. A fortunate handful advanced to program director (sometimes called operations manager), usually radio's lowest executive-level slot. 
But the station chief, assistant manager, sales manager, chief engineer positions—where the ultimate decisions were made and the highest salaries were earned—were and still are overwhelmingly white. 
There is no question that Black promotions have soared in the last several years. Today, a large percentage of soul radio's program directors are Black, and many other top-level posts are being integrated. The highly technical chief engineer slot is the area least penetrated by Blacks, however, but many attribute this more to union seniority regulations and past or present union bias than to management's efforts to keep this position lilly-white. 
Undoubtedly, the 1968 F.C.C. Equal Opportunity Order spurred 
9
broadcasting's fair employment boom. It reads: ""Each station shall establish, maintain, and carry out a positive continuing program of specific practices designed to assure equal opportunity in every aspect of station employment policy and practice."" 
Before the F.C.C. made broadcasters open some top jobs to Blacks, some stations would say they didn't have any Blacks qualified for the jobs. And that was probably true, but only because we knew there was no sense training for jobs, we weren't going to get anyway. 
But are the industry's emerging Black executives given the salary and authority commensurate with their titles, or are they showpieces? How many broadcasters will select only those Blacks who won't question established policies? There are critics who believe that many promotions are meaningless, even though Black executives insist they would not have accepted showcase positions. It may be necessary to check stations every year or so, to see if Black executives really do bring about constructive changes. 
Even the F.C.C.'s proposed new E.E.O. rules will exempt as much as 80% 78% of the industry from reporting requirements, and 
10
will leave 45,000 jobs outside the commission's scrutiny. 
Until recently, the average Black station's news bureau was nothing more than a teletype machine, usually situated in a corner of the studio. This rip-n-read approach to news reporting seemed to be designed especially for Black radio. I happen to agree with many Black radio reformers who believe this haphazard way of informing Black listeners of the day's news events was the fault of white radio executives who refused to inform Black listeners. Even though the F.C.C. requires licensees to broadcast some news, a station's news performance depends solely on the broadcaster and his staff. The demand by Black activists to end rip-n-read news in the late Sixties has resulted in some improvements by broadcasters, especially in local and regional arenas.
So far, I've been talking mostly about the media from your perspective. How it looks from the inside out. Your short history in a white-dominated, highly competitive profession your frustrations and your achievements.
Now if you will permit me to talk to you as an outsider looking in - to raise with you some of my lingering concerns about that medium in which we have the most influence. 
11
Still the most common complaint I hear from Black reformers is that the rhythm-n-blues format is used to the exclusion of other Black music forms.
Another grievance is that news and public affairs programming are still being given short shrift.
Complaints against rip-off advertising on Black stations are not as frequent today as they were during the Sixties, even though the no-money-down and faith healing pitches are far from extinct.
However, Black oriented radio the Black position in radio has improved noticeably. How do we explain this gradual process? One generally agreed turning point came on July 29th, 1967, when President Lyndon Johnson appointed an eleven person commission to look into the causes of the civil disorders that left dozens dead, hundreds injured, and millions of dollars in damages. Among his specific charges to the Advisory Commission on Civil Disorders, better known as the Kerner Commission, the president specifically included an analysis of the mass media and its impact on race relations.  
In its report eight months later, the Kerner Commission offered three general responses to this charge. The first two 
12
dealt with the actual coverage of the preceding summer's civil disorders. The third finding, which the Commission labeled ""ultimately most important,"" was ""... The media have thus far failed to report adequately on the causes and consequences of civil disorders and the underlying problems of race relations."" 
The commission said: 
By and large, news organizations have failed to communicate to both their Black and white audiences a sense of the problems America faces and the sources of potential solutions. The media report and write from the standpoint of a white man's world. The ills of the ghetto, the difficulties of life there, the Negro's burning sense of grievance are seldom conveyed. Slights and indignities are part of the Negro's daily life, and many of them come from what he now calls 'the white press'—a press that repeatedly, if unconsciously, reflects the biases, the paternalism, the indifference of white America. This may be understandable, but it is not excusable in an institution 

13
that has the mission to inform and educate the whole of our society. 

Such critiques of the media were not limited to those who studied the civil disorders of 1967. Ben Bagdikian, a long-time student of media performance, said in 1968: 
Until the recent past, Negroes have appeared in the news most often because of crime... this news treatment of the negro was more persistent and more pernicious than that of any other low income status group.... for the average white, Negroes did not go to school, earn scholarships, win election to the hierarchy of the masons, attend P.T.A. meetings, or die peaceful deaths after laudable or even uneventful lives. One wonders what the effects of this have been on white perception of the Negro, on the Negro's perception of himself, and on the news media's ability to hypnotize itself with its own information. 

It is undeniable that most ghetto residents see the press 
14
at one with the police and a general power structure they feel to be oppressive. 
Historian and Ebony editor Lerone Bennett said, ""...White-oriented media are part of the race problem. They reflect the interests, values, and aspirations of white people. … We face the need for white-oriented media to transcend the limitations of whiteness."" 
Even though a far greater number of non-whites have had bylines in the press since 1967, the American Society of Newspaper Editors reported in 1974 that probably no more than 1% of the professional newsroom staff came from minority groups. 
This is indeed shocking, but because print media does not fall under equal employment regulations set down by the Federal Communications Commission, newspapers in this country will probably continue to remain mostly white. 
Where Blacks are making some slight headway is in broadcast media, we've already discussed particularly Black-oriented radio where Blacks have made substantial gains. What about TV? Joel Dreyfuss, writing in The Washington Post, put it this way: ""In many ways the influx of Blacks into television becomes a microcosmic study 
15
of integration in America, presence without power."" In other words, the communications industry is not going to be more sensitive to the minority experience until members of the minorities attain policy-making positions, and so far very few have made it to the executive suites of the mass media. 
Another concern of mine, and I hope yours as well, is the growing concentration of media ownership. This is especially true in the South where expanding newspaper circulations and advertising revenues are attracting buyers who are gobbling up any and all available media outlets. A.J. Liebling one said: ""The only man who has a right to a free press the man who owns one."" 
The situation in Atlanta, Georgia, is probably as glaring an example of what I'm talking about as exists anywhere in the region.
During the late 1930s, Ohio investor James M. Cox began expanding into the South with his purchase of The Atlanta Journal. Not long after, Cox bought out his competitor, the Hearst chain's Atlanta Georgian, and simply shut down their presses. In 1952, he bought The Atlanta Constitution and through the affiliates Cox Broadcasting Company, now owns W.S.B. Television and W.S.B. AM and FM radio. From its Atlanta Headquarters, the intricate
16

To show how frightening the situation has become, let these figures sink in. In Alabama, there are two cities where newspaper and television are under common ownership; in Arkansas, one, in Florida, one; in Georgia, two; in Kentucky, two; in Louisiana, two; in Mississippi, three; in North Carolina, two; South Carolina, one; Tennessee, One; Texas, five; and in Virginia and West Virginia, one each. 
These include eleven Southern cities where newspaper, television and radio ownership are held in single hands. 
In the Southern region, eight conglomerates own more than 65 newspapers, including the capitol city newspapers in Georgia, Alabama, Virginia and Florida. 
These same eight companies own twenty-two Southern AM and FM radio stations, and ten Southern television stations. 
One company, for example, owns the Miami News and WIOD AM and WAIA FM in Miami; The Atlanta Journal, the Atlanta Constitution, WSB TV, WSB FM, WSB AM in Atlanta the Palm Beach News, the West Palm Beach Past-Times, the Daytona Beach News Journal; WSOC TV, WSOC AM, WSOC FM in Charlotte. Elsewhere in the country this same family controlled company owns three more television stations, two more radio stations, and operates 15 CATC systems. 
The Scripps-Howard Interests own both daily newspapers in Memphis and WMC TV, WMC FM, and WMC FM AM, the Knoxville News Sentinel and WNOX AM, the Birmingham Post Herald; the Covington, (Kentucky) Post and Times Star; the El Paso Herald Post; The Fort Worth Press; the Stuart (Florida) News; the Hollywood Sun Tattler; and WPTV in West Palm Beach. The list goes on. 
In 1974, 248 of the 430 daily newspapers in the 13-state south were controlled by companies owning more than one newspaper; in the same year, companies with interests in two or more television stations owned 126 of the South's 225 stations.  
This situation exists in totalitarian states where it is called dictatorship and thought control; here, we call it free enterprise. 
[The following sentence is typed on the verso of page 16.]
To illustrate the dimensions of the problem, let me quote at length from a study of media ownership in the South done Ber the Institute for Southern Studies. 
17
[Typeset pages are in all caps.]
Cox Conglomerate now controls twelve newspapers (ten in the South), five television and nine radio stations, plus a sprawling cable tv interest, a technical book publishing company, and a movie production outfit.
This is monopoly at its worst. In brief, one set of elderly white men control almost entirely what the citizens of Atlanta read, hear, and see. Such a system exists in Russia and China where it is called by the proper names - Dictatorship and thought control. Here we call it free enterprise.
Whatever the form of ownership or size of corporation, all of these companies have one thing in common. They restrict the number of sources of news and information available to the public. To many critics, including Nicholas Johnson, multiple ownership of so many media outlets ""is greater than a democracy should unknowingly repose in one man or corporation."" 
In recent years, the controversy over newspaper ownership of broadcast licenses in their respective cities has been revived, largely by the pressure from the Justice Department and citizens groups, such as the Citizens Communications Center, the National Black Media Coalition, the National Citizens Committee for
18
Broadcasting, and others. 
In fact, efforts by the Atlanta Communications Coalition in 1970 brought about negotiating activity unheard of at the time. For the first time in its history, the F.C.C. granted the citizens group a month's extension on filing petitions to deny relicensing to 26 stations. All 26 stations reached agreements with the coalition and no challenges were filed. This year, the coalition has already written to all the stations asking about their implementation of the five-year-old agreements. Some stations have simply ignored the agreements they signed. Others have made only token and often temporary cosmetic staff changes. The coalition is now considering two possibilities once the stations have replied to the letters: 1) challenge some stations on grounds they broke agreements they signed in good faith; 2) ask area advertisers not to patronize stations which have broken faith. 
The same kind of citizen activity is going on around the country. 

In Baltimore, the Ebony Collective is training other community groups in media reform and spreading the word about Black airwave rights. 

19

In Richmond, the Black Broadcasting Coalition is alleging employment discrimination at 17 Richmond stations. 
Affirmative action in programming and equal employment is being pursued by Black groups in Charlotte, Greenville, Durham, Charleston and Columbia—cities in both the Carolinas. 
The Jacksonville Black community has a long history of communications organizing. As of January of this year, community-owned C.A.T.V. company, with stock sold at $1 per share, was among the remaining five contenders for the Jacksonville C.A.T.V. franchise.  

In addition to these citizens efforts, the Justice Department is pursuing the issue of cross-ownership. On January 2nd, 1974, it filed petitions with the F.C.C. against the renewal of the broadcasting licenses of three major publishers—the Pulitzer Publishing Company and the Newhouse Chain in St. Louis, and Cowles Communications in Des Moines—on the grounds that their multi-media ownership represented illegal control of the advertising 
20
market in the two cities. Other suits began piling up at the F.C.C. involving cross-ownership, including one filed by the Citizens Communications Center against the Bluefield, W. VA., W.H.I.S.-TV and its partner, the Bluefield Daily Telegram, both controlled by the Shott family. Poor Blacks and miners represented by C.C.C. charged that the Shotts discriminated against Blacks in employment and programming and used their monopoly control over a good portion of West Virginia's coal fields to block any objective of the ""Miners for Democracy"" campaign to reform the United Mine Workers. 
Finally, under pressure from the courts and the Justice Department to develop some rule on cross-ownership, the F.C.C. reopened hearings in 1974. On January 28th, 1975, it issued a rule ""to prohibit newspapers in the future from acquiring radio or television broadcast stations located in their markets"" and voted ""to require newspapers to divest television or radio stations in sixteen cities"" by 1980, where the only daily owned the only city-wide radio or TV station. Five of the seven newspaper-TV combinations affected were in southern cities, including Bluefield, W.Va. The others are Anniston, Alabama; Albany, Georgia; Meridian, Mississippi; and Texarkana, Texas. One of the nine newspaper-
21
radio combinations is in the South, in Hope, Arkansas.  
Critics of media concentration are not No one should be satisfied with the Commission's new rule and plans plans are being made now to press for further divestiture of existing combinations. The media combinations are clearly alarmed, for even with the departure from the F.C.C. of Johnson and Kenneth Cox, the public interest forces are gaining in sophistication and have more clout with the F.C.C. than ever before. 
To avert a final showdown, newspaper and broadcast lobbyists are busily reminding politicians of media's crucial role during elections while asking for special legislation to protect their holdings, or at least weaken the power of the F.C.C. 
If the United States is to break the stranglehold corporate syndicates now have on information sources, we must have new legislation. And you can believe that We know these empires will not be given up without a struggle. Who understands that lesson better than we?
There is an Atlanta disc jockey named D. Robert Scott, The Man Who's Got Everything That's Hot. He likes to say ""Aint nothing to it but to do it, and I got to do it cause I'm so used to it.""

The first part of the equation is sure to be disputed by some; the second cannot be. It is supported by the Kerner Commission Report, the official statement on the crisis of race in America, which stated that ""What white Americans have never fully understood -- but what the Negro can never forget -- is that white society is deeply implicated in the ghetto. White institutions created it, white institutions maintain it, and white society condones it.""1

In this nation of immigrants, the gate way to the nation for millions fleeing other shores, we discover ourselves still homeless and hardly free.
Most other immigrants came here voluntarily, seeking freedom and a chance to survive. Our ancestors came in chaines, husband torn from wife, child from mother.
In a land where family and education are highly venerated, we were denied the chance to learn and to maintain a stable family unit. In a country settled by the victims of religious persecution, we found a strange and alien religion forced upon us. While we came from a land whose inhabitants believed in communalism and the extended family, we found created here a system of mercantile capitalism, which exactly fitted the cash-box mentality of the founding fathers.
From that day to this, this separate status of Black people in the United States has been a fact . of life. From that day to this,
 3
we have been the colonial Africans, suffering at the hands of the settler Europeans.
We live and work primarily in situations provided for by the majority, not by us. We exist at the pleasure and sufferance of the American majority, and the evidence is mounting that that existence itself may soon be called into question. Part of the difficulty is that the traditional solutions of to the ethnic dilemma ... Solutions employed with great success by other ethnic groups ... will not mold themselves entirely to our deliverance.
Individual entrepreneurship has created a class of Black millionaires in publishing, insurance, and the cosmetic fields, but has done little for the economic uplift of the mass of Black people. Pressure group politics has won many needed reforms for our group, but it is nearly impossible to make there reforms secure in a colonial society.
4
We believed, for instance, that the battle for the integrated school room was won in 1954, with only slight pressure needed from then on to finish the job. The truth was that none of the administrations in Washington since then, particularly this present one, ever intended to make the dream of an integrated education a reality. The traditional coalitions of Black people, labor, the more enlightened church leadership, all these have failed in bringing about the beloved society that was the dream of the early 1960s.
At about this time the American labour movement revealed its true interests when Black people began to demand not only labor-connected goals like minimum wages, but entry into the craft unions, which have always been lily-white. The churches have all too often played a gadfly, shallow role: interested in Black people one day, the war in Vietnam the next, abortion law reform the following week. The hoped-for coalition with white college students
5
has failed to materialize as far too many of this group have shown more interest in music, drugs, the romantic rhetoric of revolution, and the ennobling sacrifice of self-enforced poverty than in the very real problems of day-by-day existence that afflict most Black people in this country.
So we are left to the circular route of politics and then protest and then revolt, with the probable result that increasing repression -- and governmental indifference ... Will follow.
[Handwritten mark here indicating the start of a new paragraph.]
Tom Hayden has written a compelling description of that process:
""The people with fewest illusions about the welfare state are the poor who are served by it. When they protest, usually in the name of American ideals, an interesting reaction follows. Some among the majority react sympathetically, thought not always with real understanding of the causes. But a sufficient number of opposing interests are aroused to prevent any drastic
6
change, and often even moderate changes are blocked. The poor, who in most cases begin by politely petitioning their governors, soon take more drastic steps, thinking they can perhaps awaken the conscience of the majority or at least of higher authorities. They do awaken the consciences of some people, and to some extent they force elites to concede token changes. But at the same time, a ""counterrevolution"" is triggered against the potential of revolution which has been seen in the mounting protest. The system becomes deadlocked. No more than token reforms, crumbs, result for the protestors. The scale of their protest increases as they realize that appeals to conscience are inadequate. They look for methods of transscending the pressure politics that have not worked. They begin civil disobedience and disruption. The immediate reaction of the power structure is to maintain order. The police are brought into the conflict. Considerations of social,
7
political or economic solutions to the conflict are gradually replaced by the emphasis on law and order. Violent repression becomes routine.2
[Handwritten slash here.]
That frightening analysis suggest more terror for the future for us all. Bayard Rustin has more eloquently described the recent phases of Black struggle which put us where we are today.
""... The first phase, which covered something like the first half of the decade, was one in which the movement's clear objective was to destroy the legal foundations of racism in America. Thus the locale of the struggle was the South, the evil to be eliminated was Jim Crow, and the enemy, who had a special talent for arousing moral outrage among even the most reluctant sympathizers with the cause, was the rock-willed segregationist...
... The struggle that was finally mounted against the
8
system was actually fed and strengthened by the social environment from which it emerged. No profound analysis, no overriding social theory was needed in order both to locate and understand the injustices that were to be combatted. All that was demanded of one was sufficient courage to demonstrate against them. One looks back upon this period in the Civil Rights movement with nostalgia.
During the second half of the sixties, the center of the crisis shifted to the sprawling ghettos of the North. Here Black experience was radically different from that of the South. The stability of institutional relationships was largely absent in Northern ghettos, especially among the poor... Southern Blacks migrated North in search of work, seeking to become transformed from a peasantry into a working class. But instead of jobs they found only misery, and instead of becoming a working class they became a 
9
lumpenproletariat, an underclass of rejected people....
Out of such conditions, social protest was to emerge in a form peculiar to the ghetto, a form which could never have taken root in the South except in such large cities as Atlanta or Houston. The evils in the North are not easy to understand and fight against, or at least not as easy as Jim Crow, and this has given the protest from the ghetto a special edge of frustration. There are few specific injustices, such as segregated lunch counters, that offer both a clear object of protest and a good chance of victory. Indeed, the problem in the North is not one of social injustice so much as the results of institutional pathology. Each of the various institutions touching the lives of urban Blacks... those relating to education, health, employment, housing and crime... is in need of drastic reform. One might say that
10
the Northen race problem has in good part become simply the problem of the American city... which is gradually becoming a reservation for the unwanted, most of whom are Black...
If the problems of the ghetto do not lend themselves to simple analyses or solutions, then, this is because they cannot be solved without mounting a total attack on the inadequacies endemic to, and injustices embedded in, all of our institutions...3
Rustin them sums up where we are and what we face by stating that the truth about the Negro's situation in America today:
"".... There are powerful forces, composed largely of the corporate elite and Southern conservatives, which will resist any change in the economic or racial structure of this country that might cut into their resources or challenge
11
their status; and such is precisely what any program genuinely cleared to improve his lot must do. Moreover, these forces today are not merely resisting change. With their representative (Richard Nixon) in the White House, they are engaged in an assault on the advances made during the past decade....
...what is needed, therefore, is not only a program that would effect some fundamental change in the distribution of America's resources for those in the greatest need of them, but also a political majority that will support such a program....3

For Black people, the way out of this dilemma seems clear. First, an analysis suggests that our present social and economic system, as organized, is both incapable of solving the problem and at the same time is a part of the problem and cannot be appealed to or
12
relied upon as an independent arbiter in conflicts of which it is a part.
Next, we must assume that most white Americans lack the will, courage and intelligence to voluntarily grant Black Americans equality, and that they must be forced to do it by pressure.
We must also make other assumptions:


That people do not discriminate for the fun of it, but that the function of prejudice is to defend special interests (social, economic, sexual, political and psychological) and that appeals to the fair play of prejudiced people are like prayers said to the wind.


That these patterns will change, and those holding power will relingquish it if they are forced to make a clear-cut choice between continuance of the old relationship and another clear-cut and highly cherished value: economic gain or civil peace.


That struggle and conflict and confrontation are necessary for social change, and
13


That the rights and lives of real human beings are at stake, and these are in the long run neither ballotable or negotiable, that such negotiation, to be meaningful, must take place between equals acting in good faith and the issures are precisely the good faith... if not the good sense... of white Americans.


For white Americans, the question becomes whether they can give up the benefits...economic profit, political power, social status, and psychological rewards... that are derived from the status quo.
Such a movement is beginning to appear among some people, motivated perhaps by a surfeit of things American and the debasement of what was thought to be good. Americans today see their cities made unlivable; they see meaningless hard work done by many for the benefit of a few; they see themselves channeled by
15
parents and schools and job , their passions and skills cannot find an outlet in present day society. The question for our futures is whether they can be counted upon to discontinue the American tradition of racial arrogance.
But for people in general, those presently satisfied with life as it is, but yearning, with all evivent sincerity, to do something to alleviate the Black condition, there is a program as well, spelled out by Dr. DuBois years ago:
""Biologically, we are mingled of all conceivable elements, but race is psychology, not biology, and psychologically, we are a unified race with one history, one red memory, and one revolt.
It is not ours to argue whether we will be segregated or whether we ought to be a caste. We are segregated: we are a caste.
15
Our problem is: how far and in what way can we consciously and scientifically guide our future as to insure our physical survival, our spiritual freedom and our social growth? Either we do this or we die. There is no alternative. If America proposed the murder of this group, its moral descent into imbecility and crime and its utter loss of manhood, self assertion and courage, the sooner we realize this the better.
By that great line of Mc Cay, ""if we must die, let it not be like hogs."" But the alternative of not dying like hogs is not that of dying and killing like snarling dogs. It is rather conquering the world by thought and brain and plan: by expression and organized cultural ideals.
Therefore, let us not beat futile wings in impotent frenzy, but carefully plan and guide our segregated life,
16
organize in industry and politics to protect it and expand it....
What will be, no one knows. It may be a great segreation of the world along the color line: it may be an economic rebirth which insures spiritual and group integrity amid physical diversity. It may be utter annihilation of class and color barriers in one ultimate mankind, differentiated by talent, susceptibility and gift... But any of these ends are matters of long centuries and not years.
We live in years...swift, flying, transient years. We hold the possible future in our hands, but not by wish and will, only by thought, plan, knowledge and organization.

Some short while ago a popular song sent us the message: ""It's a family affair"". Until recently, that description would fit the struggle carried out across American by Black people who wanted freedom and economic equity for themselves. The massive movement of the 1960s was just that, a family affair.
If most of the troops and the generals were Black, those there was a generous supply source that was largely white.
The active pressure of the marching feet in the South coupled with massive political and financial support from sympathizers in the North helped to transform the position of Black Americans in the 1960s; we won gains at lunch counters, at movie theatres, and polling places and the fabric of legal apartheid began to be dissolved.
What had been largely a movement for purely civil rights became an economic and political movement, and Black men and women began to win employment and public office in numbers only dreamed of before.
Now we stand on the edge of the observation of our 200th birthday as an organized people, many of us afraid of what the future may bring, afraid to look too critically at our past, afraid to assign guilt and responsibility for our common condition.

Steel mill
We stand now near our 200th birthday as a people - afraid of what the future will bring and afraid to look too critically at our past, afraid to assign guilt and responsibility for our common condition.
We have a fairly new president, elected by a majority of one., who in turn has chosen a new vice president. We find ourselves in a time of international turmoil and domestic dilemma, of national indecision about the ways and means to stop rising prices and to fulfill falling expectations. Across the rest of the world, rather swift changes are taking place.
2
In Africa, the people of Mozambique and Guinea-Bissau have reached freedom and self-determination. The North Vietnamese are consolidating their victory over American military might and will soon exercise control over their entire nation.
In Europe, in Latin America--with some notable exceptions--the struggle for justice and right against oppression and wrong goes on.
Only in America is there hesitation and faltering, uncertainty and indecision. Only here do popular movements among the oppressed seem to rise and fall as regularly as the phases of the moon.
The last two-and-one half decades of Black struggle in American life have produced some marvelous victories, often overlooked today as unemployment increases and the economic
3
system nears chaos.
Gains were won at lunch counters and movie theaters and polling places and bus stations and the fabric of legal apartheid in America was destroyed. What had been a movement for civil rights has become a political movement, and Black men and women are winning office and power only dreamed of before.
But Despite an increase of 150% in the number of Blacks holding office, despite the ability to sit or eat or ride or vote in places that formerly lacked Black faces, in a real way we find our condition unchanged.
A quick look at every statistic that measures how well or poorly a group of people is doing--infant mortality rates, median family income, life expectancy--shows that while our general condition has improved, our relative condition has actually worsened.
4
It is almost as though we were climbing a molasses mountain dressed in showshoes, while everyone else rides a rather leisurely ski-lift to the top. Now the ski slopes are more treacherous and the molasses melting into mud, a Sargasso Sea of crime in high places. Of joblessness for many and hopelessness for more.
Yesterday's gains become suspect. The bus front seat loses meaning for a people whose longest trip is likely to be from the feudal system of the rural South to the mechanized, high-rise poverty of the North.
The right to vote loses meaning for a people forced to choose between Tweedledum and Tweedledee.
The right to an integrated education can mean little to children busses from one ignorant academy to another.
5
The struggles of the sixties were carried forward against discrimination in housing, employment, education and government, both because the victims became their own best champion and because they found a sympathetic ear in the national body politic.
But as the demands became more strident insistent, as a foreign war drained our treasury and young manhood, as the our best and brightest were beaten down by bullets, a shift occurred in the national consciousness.
Despite protest and movement, despite election, agitation and resignation, what has occurred over the last half-decade is simple--the reins of government have been seized by a massive coalition of the comfortable, the callous and the smug, who've closed their hearts and their minds to the claims and calls to conscience put forward by the forgotten
6
and unrepresented elements in America society. This has resulted in the national nullification of the needs of the needy, the gratuitous gratification of the gross and the greedy, a triumph for the politics of penuriousness, prevarication and impropriety, or pious platitudes and self-righteous swinishness.
The two most recent national presidential elections gave this group awesome power, the second more a rout than an election, a rout that reinstalled the fiscal fascists, the merciless merchants of the cost accounting school of social welfarism in the White House, and insured a four-year reign for men with an arrogant contempt for people and their problems.
The late American balladeer Woody Guthrie once said that some men kill with bullets; others kill with the stroke of a pen.
7
The near genocidal frightening legislative results of the last half decade, fostered by an impotent Congress, unable to resist presidential vetoes, impoundments, cut-backs, shifts in sharing and reverses in revenue have cut sharpest at the people on the bottom, those who traditionally look to their government for some help.
For a time, a portion of that trend appeared to be reversing itself. The normally moribund Congress. wet by Watergate and splashes from the tidal basin, made bold by the sight of one of their own ogling bare breasts in Boston, moved with some swiftness to topple a series of octogenarians made strong by the senility system and advanced the democratic process slightly by opening their own processes to fuller participation.
But in spite of rising prices and unemployment, in spite of increased inflation and dangers of recession, these same men and women lack the testicular fortune to offer any
8
alternative to the President's Ford's program of promoting austerity by making the poor pay more for food stamps and gas and by refusing a decent raise in Social Security.
But if the years before, the Kennedy and Johnson years, taught us any kind of lesson at all, it ought to have been that government, under militant and concerted pressure, would move, slowly and rather ponderously, all too often with all deliberate lack of speed, to become a limited partner of sorts with the American underclass in their struggle to do better for themselves.
The last few years have changed all that. The government's policy toward the poor has changed from benign concern to malignant neglect.
In the decade of the sixties, the number of people living in poverty in America was reduced by nearly one third.
9
It's not at all unreasonable to ascribe some of the gains to the so-called Great Society and New Frontier programs of that era. Yet despite these victories, the cruel and callous castrators moved with cold calculation to kill, freeze and wind down urban renewal, model cities, community action, public service employment, student loans, public housing, federal impact funds for education, and to impose a sixty percent national pullback in social services.
If we are to believe with Thomas Jefferson that the common man is ""the most precious portion of the state,"" we find that precious resource in real danger of economic extinction. today
Human problems are now placed on a balance sheet, forced to add up, to pay for themselves.
10
The new administrators in Washington run the programs they direct with all the solicitude of a hungry mortician at an old folks home.
While the nation waltzed into the seventies believing that its ""Black problem"" has either been burned or blown away, infant mortality rates for us remained twice as high as for everyone else, nearly half of all Black families in the United States earned less than $5,000 a year. The average Black American was still dying seven years earlier than his white counterpart. We remained the last to be hired and first to be fired.
Watergate became more than an apartment building to live in. Richard Nixon turned it into a shameful nightmare we were forced to live with. More than just a residential-commercial complex crowded against the banks of the Potomac,
12
graduate stands a great chance of earning less money over a lifetime of employment than will a white high school dropout.
We are where we are today because of a confluence of events of the nineteen sixties. The nonviolent--and in retrospect, lovable--marchers of the first part of that decade began to be replaced, if not in fact then certainly in the public fancy, by the rapacious rioters of the latter part of the sixties. America's cities were believed to be either in flames, under martial law, or sinking under the dead weight of a population of pioneers, the unemployed young, or their presumably unemployable parents.
The middle mind of America was running away from social concerns in a crisis state all their own. They rightly perceived that their taxes--higher proportionately than those paid by the pernicious president of the past--were escalating
13
to pay for barely maintaining what they were running away from, but they were wrongly taught, by their president and others, that their taxes were high because of the lazey poor . and not because of the corporate evader and military glutton. Lower level administrators--the mayors, councilmen and commissioners--began to face an all too often list of plagues that we have come to call the urban crisis--drug addiction, increased racial friction, civil service militancy, housing destroyed by plan 'A' faster than it's built by plan 'B', schools which warehouse and miseducate their students, relief rolls which give relief to no one.
For them, the new federalism promised to be manna from heaven.
It promised new money for all, money to pave the streets, to pay the police, to clean the air and water. But
14
instead of manna and millions, it became pennies stolen from the poor, robbing Peter to pay Paul half of what Paul couldn't get by on to begin with.
The result was to shift burden and responsibility--and accountability--from the federal government where the resources were, to the states and towns and cities where the resources aren't.
The rhetoric from Washington about sharing the wealth became a scandalous exercise in consolidating wealth and power where they always were, away from the cities, away from the children, away from people for whom wealth is an extra meal and for whom power is the ability to hide from the census taker.
The often repeated connection between today's dilemma and the end of the Reconstruction era 100 years ago
15
is more than frightening.
Then and now, a president desperate for power entered into an illicit arrangement, not just with the unreconstructed South, but with the national unreconstructed mentality that believed then--as it believes now--that private profit and public arrogance could be pursued at the expense of the people living on the American margin.
Concurrently, many of the liberal crusaders for social justice and democracy became tired, or involved in other, less traumatic concerns , and the family grew apart.
For many of them, picking up beer cans by the side of the public highway became an acceptable substitute to winning jobs in the brewery for Black people.
The aspirations of and movement by Black people began to be curtailed, not by organized violence and barbarity,
16
but by a series of nationally choreographed legal and extra legal manuevers designed to make us less than politicaml and economic equals.
The frenetic--and often frantic--activity of the nineteen sixties had created a political climate characertized by selfishness and fear; a political constituency was recruited from the frightened to form solid ranks against the forgotten.
Backlash is too hackneyed a term for a people confused by long hair and frightened by clenched fists, their politics misdirected by those who verbally oppose crime in the streets but secretly practice crime in the suites. This manipulation of the American mind has made the mundane magnificent, and placed government in the hands of men who believe in privilege for the powerful and neglect of the powerless.
There can be no better prescription for relieving this crisis, and for reviving some interest in it, than by
18
education and income became a factor among those who chose not to choose.
""It is because all the candidates seem alike,"" someone said, ""alike in appearance, in program, and in promise.""
It's true, because the issues then were age and incumbency, and allegiance to fallen idols, or contests between the demonstrated failures of one set of hopefuls and the unproved promises of another; nowhere was there commitment to radical social and economic change of the sort needed to lift the underclass to simple survival level.
An entire political national movement came to near maturity in America in the sixties. Fueled by the fire from the Southern civil rights movement, it threatened to challenge the foundations of monopoly, capital, of white skin privilege,
19
of the racial arrogance that has drained our treasury and young manhood and created vast reservations of the unwanted on this country's soil.
That movement became the partial victim of its own success. It fought for and won the right to sit in front of the bus, to cast a vote, to sit at a lunch counter. It launched a Southern Black political movement, but it failed to sustain and extend itself, and instead saw itself dissipated by struggles on the edge.
For some of us, being Black became a rhetorical or sartorial accomplishment.
For many, social commitment began to be measured by the length of your hair, or the intricacy of your handshake.
Many of the young people who some years ago marched militantly in the streets are now found running nude on the college grounds, attempting to prove perhaps, that all men
[The last page changes typeset back to the same as that of the first two pages.]
What is called for now is to put the family back together again. Under its umbrella, the National Urban League brings tigether labor and industry and the church and us, the old coalition that once spoke with great moral authority to right the wrongs of 20th Century America.
It almost appears now as if the land of julep and jasmine had inverted itself, and said to the rest of America: Be patient, don't make our mistakes, don't allow movement or conscience to beat you down. Resist — the nation will one day no longer insist that you measure up to the minimal standards we have met, and one day the fighters for freedom will grow weary.
And now it sadly seems as if the nation has agreed, has acquiesced to its underside, the hidden world of hatred and bias that always lurked just beneath the surface.
We must discover some way to seize the initiative once again, the p to place the problems of the disenherited once again on the national agenda.
Then we can begin to speak of family once again, to begin to plot and plan the world whose promise we have only dimly seen.

The battle lines are drawn in the following ways.
- A recent Gallup poll shows that a majority of Southern parents do not object to school integration.
2
- At the same time, the United States Supreme Court began its term this fall with over 40 education cases on its docket--cases involving public and private school discrimination and equal employment issues in lower and higher education in America.
- The President of the United States in his most frightening example of negative leadership has indicated he stands shoulder to shoulder with the slatterns of Boston and the louts of Louisville whose vigilante actions are intended only to thwart the Constitution and deny Black children an equal, integrated education.
- Sociologist James Coleman's latest flights of fancy are contradicted both by constitutional necessity and by scientific study. Using twenty of the nation's largest school districts as his laboratory, he attempted to demonstrate that one fifth of the white parents in half-white, half-Black
3
schools moved away to avoid court ordered desegregation. In fact, almost no desegregation occurred in the cities he allegedly studied, and, if anything, segregation in the affected cities increased. He has made common intellectual cause with Shockley and Jensen, and with Gerald Ford has joined the apologists and appeasers of those who do violence to the Constitution of the United States.1
- Finally, data released by the Office of Civil Rights shows that although Black children are 27 percent of the total school enrollment, they constitute 42 percent of all suspensions. One out of every eight Black secondary school students in America was suspended during the 72-73 school year as compared to one out of every 16 white students.
4
What is described here then is an education system unable to come to grips with the demand made 21 years ago by the United States Supreme Court to end the maintenance of the dual school system with all deliberate speed. From the days of massive resistance to today, the central theme is this--white Americans do not want their children to go to school with Black children.
To accomplish this goal there has been manufactured the myth of the neighborhood school, the lie that school segregation exists because of neighborhood segregation rather than racist school boards, and the fear that bussing somehow damages children's minds.
Let me quote at length from an article by Marion Wright Edelman, written for the Harvard Educational Review and reprinted in the New York Times. She writes:
5
""Many Northerners seek to justify continued racial segregation in public schools primarily on three grounds: (1) segregation results not from illegal public actions or policies but from natural neighborhood patterns--the so-called de jure v. de facto distinction; (2) neighborhood schools are an inviolable American tradition: and (3) school busing endangers children.
""Nowhere are these myths more plentiful than in Boston, where conservatives rail against integration in the name of community and liberal's wring their hands in confusion, embarrassed that enlightened Boston is making a national spectacle of itself.
""But none of these myths withstands scrutiny. First, the facts in Boston are typical of what judges are finding in other Northern desegregation cases, and they render virtually

meaningless in the distinction between de facto and de jure segregation.
""United States District Court Judge W. Arthur Garrity, Jr., found that intentional Boston School Committee (school board) actions and policies to segregate Black and white youngsters had produced in Boston a school system that is more highly segregated than any other school system in a city, North or South, with the same size and racial composition.
""In a case involving the Denver Public Schools, the United States Supreme Court held that segregation in fact is unconstitutional if it is the product of 'segregatory intent' of governmental authorities. The court found that sufficient segregatory intent had been shown in the Denver School Board's 'manipulations' of its neighborhood policy to increase the segregation that would have resulted from a truly neutral policy.
7
""Such segregatory policies or acts can be manipulations of school or housing patterns. The segregation of American cities is in large part the result of the policies and attitudes of the Federal Housing Administration. Much of the single-family housing that exists today was sold with F.H.A. or Veterans Administration Mortgage Coverage.
""Since 1935, F.H.A. underwriting manuals have recommended that two principles be followed (1) That racially restrictive covenants shall be honored; (2) that housing in racially integrated neighborhoods shall be rated at less than its fair market price.
""In a study conducted by the F.H.A. in 1939 to guide its housing policies, it was noted that:
'In a country settled largely by the white race, such members of other races, of course, have not been absorbed. . .
8
""It is a mere truism to enunciate that colored people tend to live in segregated districts of American cities. . .it is in the twilight zone, where members of different races live together, that racial mixtures tend to have a depressing effect upon land values and therefore upon rents.'
""As a result, American families could not move into integrated neighborhoods even if they wanted to, since the F.H.A. thought them bad economic risks.
""Second, the concept of neighborhood schools is not embedded in American educational tradition. Judges have found in numerous cases that the intense commitment to neighborhood schools seems to pale when segregation is possible.
""In the Detroit desegregation case decided by the United States Supreme Court in 1974, all the attendance area changes and options for ten years were examined in the court.
9
""Parents in integrated neighborhoods could elect to send their children to either all-white or all-Black schools outside their neighborhoods, but not to integrated schools. More than 20,000 individual student transfer requests were reviewed and shown to contain explicit racial motives for white parents seeking nonneighborhood school assignments. All were approved by school officials.
""Neighborhood schools presume neighborhoods exist, and South Boston has been heralded as one of the few remaining coherent communities in Boston. But while it is a 'stable' neighborhood as such things go in a contemporary American city, 40 per cent of its 1970 residents have moved there within the preceding five years.
""Even if South Boston were the homogeneous community it is painted to be, maintaining neighborhood schools when they
10
ensured segregated education would not be defensible. As a federal district judge stated more than ten years ago in ordering desegregation of Fort Worth Public Schools: 'The constitutional right...is not to attend a school closest to home, but to attend schools which, near or far, are free of governmentally imposed racial distinctions.'
""Third, unlike neighborhood schools, school busing has a long-distinguished tradition in America. Forty-eight states authorize it and 15 states allow students to be transported to private schools at public expense. In the 1971-72 school year, almost 44 per cent of all American children rode 250,000 buses more than two billion miles--figures that would increase if we counted use of other kinds of public and private transportation to get children to school. But the Department of Health, Education and Welfare estimated that only 3 per cent of the busing has
11
occurred as a result of desegregation.
""Neither the average amount nor the length of busing has greatly increased with school desegregation. In a case involving the desegregation of the Charlotte-Mecklenburg schools, which provoked some of the most virulent antibusing opposition, the record revealed that before desegregation some one way bus trips ran to one hour and 14 minutes. After desegregation, bus rides averaged 30-35 minutes.
""I have often been asked recently about why I support desegregation and school busing when some Black parents oppose it. Black parents are no more a monolith than any other parents. And they are human enough to resent having their children continue to bear the disproportionate brunt of achieving desegregation. There is hardly a Black adult in this country who does not fight feelings of despair and
12
fatigue daily from endless exposure to white hostility, condescension and plain insensitivity.
""There is not one of us who would will this legacy of misery to our children. But racism is not something you can avoid, even in the confines of Harlem. Racial ignorance and insensitivity are not cured by keeping children apart.""2
Despite all these lies and the current trauma, most Americans still believe strongly in the public schools.
Lawrence Cremin wrote in The Genius of American Education, ""Nothing is more striking than the boundless faith of the citizenry in the power of popular education. It was a faith widely shared by the generation that founded the republic, and it has been an essential article of American belief ever since...education has been...America's instrument of social progress and
13
""reform, and it has commanded such widespread popular support that D. W. Brogan was once moved to refer to the public school as America's formally unestablished national church.""
As public schools began to spread in America early in the nineteenth century, it was the vision of Horace Mann and other early advocates who finally convinced the American people that even those with no children in public schools should be required to pay taxes to support education.
They envisioned a common school, open to all, which would be the agent of national development along democratic lines, producing social harmony and equal opportunity, and in time eliminate poverty altogether.
It was not easy to establish a universal public system. Southern states especially were loath to accept the idea and even then it took private philanthrophy to include Black people
14
even partially in the system.
But our public education has by now become remarkably inclusive. It is a vast enterprise which employs five million people and spends nearly $50 billion a year. Schools are one of the major public institutions in American life, consuming significant political energy as well as dollars.
One justification for this huge investment has always been that public schools would produce a more just and equal society based on individual merit. There have always been other goals--for example, the need for a literate, informed citizenry to make democracy possible. But the goal of individual improvement and advancement through education has been a strong article of faith. Succeeding generations of American parents believed ever more strongly that schooling was the key to mobility and success for their children.
15
The national goal of equal educational opportunity arises from this fundamental faith in the value of public education. In the last few years, however, we have been challenged to question whether our original faith in the social benefits of education has been misplaced.
Waves of criticism, of course, wash over public education in every generation. But lately the schools are being rocked by a whole series of attacks which seem to undermine further attempts to equalize educational resources for all children.
Perhaps most astonishing is the proposition from some social scientists that the quality of education itself does not directly influence life opportunity or income distribution. Those who believed that more and better schooling would insure mobility and economic success and who perhaps
16
thought that this was the primary justification for public education have been shaken by a number of recent publications.
Christopher Jencks write in 1972 that the goal of social mobility through education may be a myth.
Coleman in his better days brought into question the relationship between the amount of money spent and quality of education in a report for the U.S. Office of Education in 1966. He examined the situation of poor and minority children in school and concluded that family and social environment evidently weigh more heavily in determining educational achievement than anything the school does, or how many resources it has. Others have carried this ""resources and quality"" argument further.
I maintain that on this issue the reality of many school situations has been obscured. Last year Virginia Fleming
17
wrote in The Cost of Neglect/The Value of Equity, that many Southern school districts still spend less than $400 per pupil each year. It's hard to pretend that the lack of money is unimportant to quality. When textbooks are ten years out of date, libraries are non-existent, choices of what to learn are limited, the cost of school breakfasts and lunches makes them unavilable, teachers are undertrained and underpaid, then the poor quality of education is clearly related to inadequate funds.
According to Fleming, comparison of school district expenditures within each state reveals the same fact: in every state in the union there are tremendous differences in the amount spent on each child. The accident of birth into a rich area or a poor area determines how much will be invested in a child's education.
18
To cite the most flagrant disparity in the South, and perhaps in the nation: in Texas, public school expenditures per pupil for the 1969-70 school year were $197 for the lowest district as compared to $11,096 for the highest district.
For many Americans, the first great disparity in opportunity encountered in life is precisely the institution that is supposed to be America's instrument of social progress.
In other states around the country, with and without court cases, school finance is a large political issue.
It may well be true that, beyond a certain point, the improvement of the learning process depends on many other factors which school money cannot buy. But until all schools get at least to that point, it is cruel to suggest that money does not matter.
19
Or as Coons, Clune and Sugarman said in 1970 in Private Wealth and Public Education, ""Whatever it is that money may be thought to contribute to the education of children, that commodity is something highly prized by those who enjoy the greatest measure of it. If money is inadequate to improve education, the residents of poor districts should at least have an equal opportunity to be disappointed by its failure.""
Few parents in wealthy suburbs are going to take seriously the notion that they can give up their higher levels of spending without reducing the quality of their children's education.
The question of whether more money really leads to better education is surrounded by another money problem--education already uses up a large share of the nation's resources. The price of public education has tripled since
20
about 1960; the bill still seems to be rising about ten percent a year.
Part of that stupendous rise in school expense is due to the fact that we are trying to educate more children--both a larger population and larger percent of the population in school longer--but more important causes are higher costs of instructional materials, salaries, fringe benefits, building construction.
Many tax payers are not convinced that such increases have produced much improvement in education, and although it is likely that there are some who would be willing to bear larger tax loads if they could see dramatic improvement, the sad truth is that many more are simply concerned about the growing size of the total education bill and its effect on their taxes. This attitude--especially evident where costs
21
are already high--can be seen in the rejection by voters of school bonds or school tax increases in recent years.
Serious predictions about the next decade indicate that costs may not keep going up at such a steep rate. Inflation, of course, will doubtless be a devastating problem for some time to come. But enrollments should go down due to the decline in population growth. Teacher shortages, moreover, are pretty much a thing of the past. One can even hope that new attention to efficiency and better school management could help bring costs down.
Finally, the use of property taxes to finance public schools must be eliminated. These taxes take more from low income tax payers than from any other, and reach a little more than 50% of the nation's capital.
22
It's apparent that since the beginning of this decade, there has been very little evidence that anyone in public life cared very much about equal educational opportunities for all Americans.
In fact, whenever education is an issue at all, it is from the negative standpoint, against busing, against sex education, against certain books.
When these issues are used to cloud the real issue of equal education opportunities what are the results? When any list of being drawn of the wrongs in public education, its most visible indices are its effects on the most disadvantaged Americans.
Added to the increasing rates of school dropouts, suspensions and expulsions--which are much higher among minority group youth than for white youth--is a new phenomenon, the
23
""pushout"". The pushout is defined in a study by the Southern Regional Council's School Desegregation Project and the Robert F. Kennedy Memorial as the student who through discriminatory treatment and arbitrary actions of school authorities is excluded from school, or else is so alientated by the hostility of his or her school environment, leaves school.
But even those Black youths who stay in school are shortchanged. Although the median years of education for Blacks now nearly equals the median for whites. The quality of education afforded Blacks is much lower. In Equality of Educational Opportunity, Coleman found that the median score for white children on achievement tests was 9.7 points higher than that of Black children in grade one, and 11.1 points higher in grade 12. The schools, one could conclude, are
24
widening rather than lessening disparities.
In order to change this situation, innovative programs, expanded funding which would necessarily include school finance reform, and institutional reform will be required at all levels from preschool through higher education, including adult education.
Proponents of reform are unlikely to receive a sympathetic hearing in any State House, local school board or in the corridors of the White House unless there is built up in this country a political force powerful enough to make the crisis in and failure of education in America part of the national agenda.
That is a job for all of us, but particularly for people such as yourselves, people who daily see what schools can do, and don't, should do, but won't, and people who see
25
what wasted products production line schools can produce.
The crisis has been heightened in recent years by a former president who was the most anti-education president since James Buchanan, who vetoed the original Land Grant College Act in 1860.
There are no indications that the current administration is any more concerned about lack of opportunities available to disadvantaged Americans.
Let me close by reading yet another statement, this one from Southerners who gathered in New York recently to discuss the fight against inequity in American education. They said then:
The ongoing battle to end segregation and inequality of educational opportunity--in the North as well as the South--will continue. Complete desegregation of our schools is
26
essential to the achievement of freedom and equality in our society. The corrosive effects of racism harm whites as much as Blacks and other racial minorities, Northerners as much as Southerners, and the non-poor as much as the poor. The survival of this nation depends upon the achievement of interracial accord and interracial equity in our political, economic, and educational institutions. There is encouraging evidence of positive achievement in the area of school desegregation, and this impirical evidence must be brought to the attention of the American public, particularly by the media. It must also be recognized that those federal judges who have acted in consistent accord with the 1954 Brown decision and succeeding cases have in truth upheld and defended the very foundations of our constitutional system. Those Americans of all walks of life who have remained faithful to
27
the ideal of equality will be vindicated by history. When all is said and done, one thing remains clear: separate is not and cannot be equal. Segregation has been tried, and is still being tried, but segregation does not work. We state unequivocally that the choice for America is this: that we achieve desegregation and equality in our society, or else perish as a nation.

It is the central nerve of the nation. It influences the way we look at the world. More importantly, it influences the way we look at ourselves. Its impact is felt on virtually every aspect of American life -- the way we relate to each other, the way we educate our children, our relationship to our environment, who we elect to public office, and what we eat.
Surveys tell us that almost every home in the United States has at least one television or radio set, which when combined, account for the bulk of the average American's leisure time.
We also know that the journalistic profession has been shockingly backward in seeking out, hiring, training and promoting Blacks. This tradition of discrimination against Blacks in the media has been largely responsible for the absence of Black faces in city rooms and on television screens.
Radio has been a slightly different story. Richard Kahlenberg wrote in 1966 that ""Due to the nature of American broadcasting (and he was talking mainly about radio), Negroes have found their
2
way into the industry's purview as performers and sought after listeners, primarily for economic reasons.""
He added, ""Very seldom are broadcast owners, white or Negro, seeking to use radio for special pleading or agitation on behalf of the Negro. Indeed, far from being a medium for communicating a specifically Negro viewpoint to a white audience, radio has become, because of its commercial nature, a medium by which the white establishment, through advertising, is actually seeking to sell its values to the Negro.""
During radio's pre-television heyday of the 1930's and early 1940's, local and network broadcasters relegated anywhere from one to three hours a day to Black audiences. On local stations, this usually took the form of recorded blues or spiritual music programs, often with white disc jockeys. On Sundays, religious programming included live broadcasts of Black church services or gospel singers. From time to time, Black talent was featured on radio broadcasts. During the thirties, Count Basie's national popularity was aided in this way.
Meanwhile, the national networks continued portraying us as ignorant and shiftless in radio comedies such as ""Amos 'N' Andy""
3
and ""The Beulah show.""
Post-war radio, as yet unaffected by television, attempted to appeal to all age groups, rather than specializing as most radio stations do today. Therefore, early Black radio was patterned largely after its general market counterparts.
Likewise, the radio announcer most likely was jack-of-all-trades. He broadcast news, wrote commercials, planned special events, conducted interviews.
As Americans switched to televisions for entertainment and information during the early fifties, radio was forced to change radically. That change took the form of specialty radio and gave rise to the all-rock, all-jazz, all-classical, all-talk stations.
To enterprising executives aware of the Black surge in economic power, the all-Black station was a logical specialty. Black-oriented radio spread rapidly in the fifties -- first in the North and Midwest, then throughout the South.
Since the boom of the fifties, the basic format on Black-oriented radio has changed very little -- several consecutive rhythm-n-blues or soul programs throughout the
4
broadcasting day, interrupted by one or two newscasts every hour, maybe a recorded gospel music broadcast and religious programming on Sundays. So, Black radio listeners -- no matter their age or preference -- find only one type of outlet aimed specifically at them.
One young Black critic of the medium, William Wright, asked. ""Do we need 24 hours of James Brown?""
Answering his own question, he said, ""No, we don't. If we're going to talk about freedom and self-determination, we need to hear our Black heroes performing in other art forms. We need to talk about drug addition, about slum landlords, about jobs, about education. But the white man gives us 24 hours of soul because it pads his already stuffed pockets and keeps Black people ignorant.""
White radio reformers concur with this charge of exploitation, not only in soul radio but in general. A circular issued by the National Citizens Committee for Broadcasting, blasted what it considers the industry's ""contempt for the public interest"" and ""over-commercialization, by which the broadcasters so shamefully exploit even our children.""
5
Another reform agency, Citizens Communication Center, charges in its statement of purpose, ""The broadcast industry often has not understood -- or has chosen to ignore -- the programming tastes and requirements of broad portions of the (viewing) public.""
Soul radio executives defend their practices by insisting they give their listeners only what the listeners want. If it also happens to be profitable, so what?
My quarrel is not with soul music, which I happen to enjoy. My quarrel is with the broadcasters who could offer information and public service without disturbing their profits. The white broadcasters who have brainwashed us into accepting nothing but soul, and are creating a soul music mentality among Black youths.
It might be useful to recall the words of former F.C.C. Commissioner Nicholas Johnson, who spoke at N.A.T.R.A.'s 1968 convention in Miami: ""When your listeners are crying out to understand and to be understood, and you keep on spinning the top forty, you may literally find yourself, a modern day electronic Negro NERO, playing fiddle music while your own Rome burns.""
Today, white management, newly arrived Black executives,
6
and disc jockeys are re-examining the deejay's role in the community. I agree with Black radio executive, Noble V. Blackwell, who said, ""The Black disc jockey today cannot make it sitting at a turntable three or four hours daily and saying 'sock it to me.' Today, he's more than a disc jockey -- he's a communications specialist, almost as important as the minister.""
There is growing evidence that today's deejays are doing more than a little soul-searching. That is not to suggest there is a trend toward lifeless announcers. Broadcasters must still be witty and creative, but they must also offer entertainment with a message. Along with the sock-it-to-me chant must be admonitions against drug addiction or dropping out of school, job information, expressions of Black pride.
An example of what I'm talking about is Bob (Nitehawk) Terry of W.O.L. in Washington, who on the night of April 4th, 1968, after W.O.L. newsmen confirmed that Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. had died of an assassin's bullet, abruptly switched formats and somberly criticized white listeners who ""run back to the Maryland and Virginia suburbs every evening and leave the problems back here in the city.""
7
I am encouraged to see more and more Black announcers expressing this kind of candor on the air and becoming behind-the-scenes reformers. Across the country, Black disc jockeys are joining labor unions and striking against their employers for higher wages and better working conditions, many leak information against their employers to newspapers and civic organizations. No longer fearful of possible consequences, Black radio announcers now use the retaliatory dismissal of a co-worker as a reason to step up their militancy against recalcitrant employers.
The Black ""jack-of-all-trades"" is also vanishing. More and more Blacks are specializing like their white counterparts. But we still have a long way to go. By the time a Black employee finally gets a contract for a $35 a month raise in pay, he is often still well below what his white colleagues are getting at other stations.
Newsweek magazine reported in 1967 that ""While the money in Black-oriented radio is green, the power is strictly white.... there is just one Negro station manager and few top Negro executives; on many stations, only the disc jockeys and janitors are Black.""
8
For years, Black employees at white-owned facilities advanced to Music Director, Religious Program Director, or other positions with no executive-level power at most stations. The rare soul station that boasted any kind of news-gathering and compilation system also usually hired a white News Director. A fortunate handful advanced to Program Director (sometimes called Operations Manager), usually radio's lowest executive-level slot.
But the Station Chief, Assistant Manager, Sales Manager, Chief Engineer positions -- where the ultimate decisions were made and the highest salaries were earned -- were and still are overwhelmingly white.
There is no question that Black promotions have soared in the last several years. Today, a large percentage of soul radio's Program Directors are Black, and many other top-level posts are being integrated. The highly technical Chief Engineer slot is the area least penetrated by Blacks, however, but many attribute this more to union seniority regulations and past or present union bias than to management's efforts to keep this position lilly-white.
Undoubtedly, the 1968 F.C.C. Equal Opportunity Order spurred
9
broadcasting's fair employment boom. It reads: ""Each station shall establish, maintain, and carry out a positive continuing program of specific practices designed to assure equal opportunity in every aspect of station employment policy and practice.""
Before the F.C.C. made broadcasters open some top jobs to Blacks, some stations would say they didn't have any Blacks qualified for the jobs. And that was probably true, but only because we knew there was no sense training for jobs we weren't going to get anyway.
But are the industry's emerging Black executives given the salary and authority commensurate with their titles, or are they mere showpieces? How many broadcasters will select only those Blacks who won't question established policies? There are critics who believe that many promotions are meaningless, even though Black executives insist they would not have accepted showcase positions. It may be necessary to check stations every year or so, to see if Black executives really do bring about constructive changes.
Even the F.C.C.'s proposed new E.E.O. rules will exempt as much as 80% of the industry from reporting requirements, and
10
will leave 45,000 jobs outside the commission's scrutiny.
Until recently, the average Black station's News Bureau was nothing more than a teletype machine, usually situated in a corner of the studio. This rip-n-read approach to news reporting seemed to be designed especially for Black radio. I happen to agree with many Black radio reformers who believe this haphazard way of informing Black listeners of the day's news events was the fault of white radio executives who refused to inform Black listeners. Even though the F.C.C. requires licensees to broadcast some news, a station's news performance depends solely on the broadcaster and his staff. The demand by Black activists to end r rip-n-read news in the late sixties has resulted in some improvement by broadcasters, especially in local and regional arenas.
So far, I've been talking mostly about the media from your perspective. How it looks from the inside out. Your short history in a white-dominated, highly competitive profession -- your frustrations and your achievements.
Now if you will permit me to talk to you as an outsider looking in -- to raise with you some of my lingering concerns about that medium in which we have the most influence.
11
Still the most common complaint I hear from Black reformers is that the rhythm-n-blues format is used to the exclusion of other Black music forms.
Another grievance is that news and public affairs programming are still being given short shrift.
Complaints against rip-off advertising on Black stations are not as frequent today as they were during the sixties, even though the no-money-down and faith healing pitches are far from extinct.
However, Black oriented radio has improved noticeably. How do we explain this gradual process? One generally agreed turning point came on July 29th, 1967, when President Lyndon Johnson appointed an eleven person commission to look into the causes of the civil disorders that left dozens dead, hundreds injured, and millions of dollars in damages. Among his specific charges to the Advisory Commission on Civil Disorders, better known as the Kerner Commission, the President specifically included an analysis of the mass media and its impact on race relations.
On its report eight months later, the Kerner Commission offered three general responses to this charge. The first two
[As noted on the first page, page 12 is missing.]
13
that has been the mission to inform and educate the whole of our society.

Such critiques of the media were not limited to those who studied the civil disorders of 1967. Ben Bagdikian, a long-time student of media performance, said in 1968:
Until the recent past, Negroes have appeared in the news most often because of crime... This news treatment of the Negro was more persistent and more pernicious than that of any other low income status group. ... For the average white, Negroes did not go to school, earn scholarships, win election to the hierarchy of the Masons, attend P.T.A. meetings, or die peaceful deaths after laudable or even uneventful lives. One wonders what the effects of this have been on white perception of the Negro, on the Negro's perception of himself, and on the news media's ability to hypnotize itself with its own information.

It is undeniable that most ghetto residents see the press
14
at one with the police and a general power structure they feel to be oppressive.
Historian and Ebony Editor Lerone Bennett said, ""...White-oriented media are part of the race problem. They reflect the interests, values, and aspirations of white people. ... We face the need for white-oriented media to transcend the limitations of whiteness.""
Even though a far greater number of non-whites have had bylines in the press since 1967, the American Society of Newspaper Editors reported in 1974 that probably no more than 1% of the professional newsroom staff came from minority groups.
This is indeed shocking, but because print media does not fall under Equal Employment regulations set down by the Federal Communications Commission, newspapers in this country will probably continue to remain white.
Where Blacks are making some slight headway is in broadcast media. We've already discussed Black-oriented radio where Blacks have made substantial gains. What about TV? Joel Dreyfuss, writing in The Washington Post, put it this way: ""In many ways the influx of Blacks into television becomes a microcosmic study
15
of integration in America, presence without power."" In other words, the communications industry is not going to be more sensitive to the minority experience until members of the minorities attain policy-making positions, and so far very few have made it to the executive suites of the mass media.
[The following paragraphs are underlined in blue pen.]
Another concern of mine, and I hope yours as well, is the growing concentration of media ownership. This is especially true in the South where expanding newspaper circulations and advertising revenues are attracting buyers who are gobbling up any and all available media outlets.
The situation in Atlanta, Georgia, is probably as glaring an example of what I'm talking about as exists anywhere in the region.
During the late 1930s, Ohio investor James M. Cox began expanding into the South with his purchase of The Atlanta Journal. Not long after, Cox bought out his competition, the Hearst chain's Atlanta Georgian, and simply shut down their presses. In 1952, he bought The Atlanta Constitution, and through the affiliated Cox Broadcasting Company, now owns W.S.B. Television and W.S.B. AM and FM radio. From its Atlanta headquarters, the intricate
16
Cox conglomerate now controls twelve newspapers (ten in the South), five television and nine radio stations, plus a sprawling cable TV interest, a technical book publishing company, and a movie production outfit.
This is monopoly at its worst. In brief, one set of elderly white men controls entirely what the citizens of Atlanta read, hear and see. Such a system exists in Russia and China where it is called by its proper names -- dictatorship and thought control. Here we call it free enterprise.
Whatever the form of ownership or size of corporation, all of these companies have one thing in common. They restrict the number of sources of news and information available to the public. To many critics, including former FCC Commissioner Nicholas Johnson, multiple ownership of so many media outlets ""is greater than a democracy should unknowingly repose in one man or corporation.""
In recent years, the controversy over newspaper ownership of broadcast licenses in their respective cities has been revived, largely by the pressure from the Justice Department and citizens groups, such as the Citizens Communications Center, the National Black Media Coalition, the National Citizens Committee for
17
broadcasting, and others.
In fact, efforts by the Atlanta Communications Coalition in 1970 brought about negotiating activity unheard of at the time. For the first time in its history, the F.C.C. granted the citizens group a month's extension on filing petitions to deny relicensing to 26 stations. All 26 stations reached agreements with the Coalition and no challenges were filed. This year, the Coalition has already written to all the stations asking about their implementation of the five-year-old agreements. Some stations have simply ignored the agreements they signed. Others have made only token and often temporary cosmetic staff changes. The Coalition is now considering two possibilities once the stations have replied to the letters: 1) challenge some stations on grounds they broke agreements they signed in good faith; 2) ask area advertisers not to patronize stations which have broken faith.
The same kind of citizen activity is going on around the country.

In Baltimore, the Ebony Collective is training other community groups in media reform and spreading the word about Black airwave rights.
18
In Richmond, the Black Broadcasting Coalition is alleging employment discrimination at 17 Richmond stations.
Affirmative action in programming and equal employment is being pursued by Black groups in Charlotte, Greenville, Durham, Charleston and Columbia -- cities in both the Carolinas.
The Jacksonville Black community has a long history of communications organizing. As of January of this year, community-owned C.A.T.V. Company, with stock sold at $1 per share, was among the remaining five contenders for the Jacksonville C.A.T.V. franchise.

In addition to these citizens efforts, the Justice Department is pursuing the issue of cross-ownership. On January 2nd, 1974, it filed petitions with the F.C.C. against the renewal of the broadcasting licenses of three major publishers -- the Pulitzer Publishing company and the Newhouse chain in St. Louis, and Cowles Communications in Des Moines -- on the grounds that their multi-media ownership represented illegal control of the advertising
19
market in the two cities. Other suits began piling up at the F.C.C. involving cross-ownership, including one filed by the Citizens Communication Center against the Bluefield, W. Va., W.H.I.S.-TV and its partner, The Bluefield Daily Telegram, both controlled by the Shott family. Poor Blacks and miners represented by C.C.C. charged that the Shotts discriminated against Blacks in employment and programming and used their monopoly control over a good portion of West Virginia's coal fields to block any objective of the miners for democracy campaign to reform the United Mine Workers.
Finally, under pressure from the courts and the Justice Department to develop some rule on cross-ownership, the F.C.C. reopened hearings in 1974. On January 28th, 1975, it issued a rule ""to prohibit newspapers in the future from acquiring radio or television broadcast stations located in their markets"" and voted ""to require newspapers to divest television or radio stations in sixteen cities"" by 1980, where the only daily owned the only city-wide radio or TV station. Five of the seven newspaper-TV combinations affected were in Southern cities, including Bluefield, W.Va. The others are Anniston, Alabama; Albany, Georgia; Meridian, Mississippi; and Texarkana, Texas. One of the nine newspaper-
20
radio combinations is in the South, in Hope, Arkansas.
Critics of media concentration are not satisfied with the Commission's new rule and plan to press for further divestiture of existing combinations. The media combinations are clearly alarmed, for even with the departure from the F.C.C. of Johnson and Kenneth Cox, the public interest forces are gaining in sophistication and have more clout with the F.C.C. than ever before.
To avert a final showdown, newspaper and broadcast lobbyists are busily reminding politicians of media's crucial role during elections while asking for special legislation to protect their holdings, or at least weaken the power of the F.C.C.
If the United States is to break the stranglehold corporate syndicates now have on information sources, we must have new legislation. And you can believe that these empires will not be given up without a struggle. Who understands that lesson better than we.
There is an Atlanta disc jockey named D. Robert Scott, the man who's got everything that's hot. He likes to say ""Aint nothing to it but to do it, and I got to do it cause I'm so used to it.""
21
Now in 1975 we have become used to too many things we shouldn't be. On the airwaves and in public and private life, too many of us have adopted a style of behavior because ""White people have been doing it for years; it's our turn now.""
It never will be our turn to do what Nixon and Agnew did; never our turn to declare war on helpless nations or lose wars against poverty here at home.
If any thing, it is our turn now to try to make this country become what it promised us it would be -- long before the first radio tube was ever conceived.
We've got to do it."

nearly half of all Black families in the United States earned less than $5000 a year;

One man was President of the United States; now he has impeached himself, has gone into retirement on San Clemente's sunny shores, discredited as a tax cheat, a liar and a petty thief, and now he has been excused from punishment for commiting crimes that have filled our jails with men and women not fortunate to be born rich or white or to have been elected to high office.

These conditions under which we struggle do not exist in a vacuum; they are part and parcel of a larger picture of powerful forces determined to maintain the status quo.
What has happened is this: the reins of government have been seized by a massive coalition of the comfortable, the callous and the smug who've closed their minds and hearts to the claims and calls to conscious put forward by the forgotten and unrepresented elements in American society.
This has resulted in the national nullification of the needs of the needy, the gratuitous gratification of the gross and the greedy, a triumph for the politics of penuriousness, prevarication and impropiety, of pious platitudes and self righteous swinishness

Julian Bond - 6/1/73
It is now more than six months since the November day when the coalition of the comfortable, the callous and the smug who closed their ranks, and closed their hearts, against the claims and calls to conscience put forward by the forgotten and unrepresented elements in American society.
Two elections gave them awesome power, the second, a That rout that reinstalled the fiscal facists, the merciless merchants of the cost accounting school of social welfarism in the White House, and insured a four year reign for men with an arrogant contempt for people and their problems.
The late American balladeer Woodie Guthrie once said that some men kill with bullets; others with the stroke of a pen.
Coupled with an impotent Congress, the vetoes, cut-backs, shifts in sharing and reverses in revenue cut sharpest at the people at the bottom, those who look to government for help.
If the Kennedy and Johnson years taught any lesson at all, it
2 5
was ] 2 that government, under pressure, would move, slowly and ponderously, all too often with all deliberate lack of speed - to become a partner of sorts with the American underclass in their struggle to do better for themselves. The last three four years have changed all that. The government's attitude has changed from benign concern to malignant neglect.
In the decade of the sixties, the number of people living in poverty was nearly halved.
It's not unreasonable at all to ascribe some of these gains to the Great Society programs of era.
Yet the callous castrators moved with cold calculation to kill, freeze or wind down urban renewal, model cities, community action, public service employment, student loans, public housing, federal impact funds for education, and to impose a sixty percent national pull-back in social services.
3 6
Human problems are now placed on a balance sheet and forced to add op: to pay for themselves. The new administrators run the programs they direct with the solicitude of a hungry mortician at an old folks home.
insert
We are where we are today because of a confluence of events of the sixties. The nonviolent marchers of the first part of that decade were replaced, if not in fact then certainly in the public fancy, by the rapacious rioters in the last part of the sixties.
America's cities were believed to be either in flames, under martial law, or sinking under the dead weight of a population of pensioners, the unemployed young and their presumably unemployable parents.
The rest of America was running from the city in a crisis state of their own. They rightly perceived that their taxes - higher proportionately than those payed by ITT - were escalating to pay for barely maintaining what they had run away from, but were wrongly taught - by their President and others - that their taxes were high because of the lazy poor, and
4 7
not because of the corporate evader or the or the military glutton.
The rulers of the cities, on the other hand - the mayors, commissioners and councilmen - faced an all too common list of plagues we have come to call the urban crisis - drug addiction, increased racial friction, civil service militancy, housing destroyed by Plan ""A"" faster than it was constructed by Plan ""B""; schools which warehoused and miseducated their students, relief rolls giving relief to no one. For them the New Federalism promised to be manna from heaven.
It promised new money for them all, money to do what they then could not, money to pave the streets, to pay the police, to clean the air and water.
Instead of manna and millions, it became pennies stolen from the poor, robbing Peter to pay Paul half of what Peter couldn't get by on to begin with.
The result was to shift the burden of the federal government where ] 6 the resources were to the towns and cities where the resources aren't.
5 8
The municipal managers, forced to choose between funding underfunded program X or Y, chose more often than not to buy votes at the expense of the public good, with tax rebates and fancy hardware.
The administration's rhetoric about sharing the wealth became a scandalous exercise in consolidating wealth and power where they always were: away from the cities, away from children, away from people for whom wealth is an extra meal, and power the ability to hide from the census taker.
The often repeated connection between today's dilemma and the end of the Reconstruction era is firghtening.
The collusion between a hostile administration and a seemingly unfeeling majority, then and now, seemed to doom the hope of the American underclass.
Then and now, a President desperate for power made an arrangement, ] 7 not just with the unreconstructed South, but with the national
6 9
unreconstructed mentality that believes now - as it did then - that private profit and public arrogance could be punished at the expense of the people living on the American margin.
Concurrently, the liberal crusaders for social justice and democracy became tired, or involved in others, less traumatic concerns. For many of them, picking up beer cans by the highway became an acceptable substitute to winning jobs for Black people in the brewery, their outrage, guilt and indignation receding receded as the dark plague came closer to liberal hearth and home. The outburst of bigotry in Boston is one such example.
The aspirations of and movement by Black people began to be curtailed, not just by organized violence and barbarity, but by a series of national choreographed legal and extra-legal maneuvers designed to make us less than political and economic equals.
The frenetic activity of the sixties created a political movement characterized by selfishness and fear; a political constituency was recruited from the frightened to form solid ranks against the forgotten. ] 8
7 10
Backlash is too hackneyed a term for people confused by long hair and frightened by clenched fists, their politics misdirected by those who verbally oppose crime in the streets and secretly practice crime in the suites.
This manipulation of the American mind made the mundane magnificent and placed government in the hands of men who believe in privilege for the powerful and neglect of the powerless.
[Faint marks cross the following paragraph.]
I can think of no better prescription for relieving the urban this crisis, and reviving interest in it, than by creating a partisan national coalition of need, of mothers who want care – not warehousing – for their children, of fathers who want work at a decent wage, of people who work for a living but can’t live on what they make as well as those who can’t find work but can’t live on what we so grudgingly give, those who want an end to welfare and capitalism for the poor and subsidy and socialism for the wealthy and who must learn that sufficiency for people at the
9 11
at the bottom can also mean stability for those in the middle: all those people now live in our cities America, divided now by race and class, fearful of each other, contentious and impotent.
The task becomes one of making the Congressional election of this year turn on commitment to the cities end this crisis. The conferees Those of you gathered here come from the American metropolis here and there in America and are represented in Congress – with rare exception – by men and women whose commitments are to an earlier era in American history, when farm and field were represented more than alley and expressway.

We are the victims of our own successes.
When the right to sit at a lunch counter, or the front of the bus, or to cast a vote was won, too many of us tired from the struggle.
Being Black became a rhetorical or sartorial accomplishment. Social commitment began to be measured by the length of your hair or the trickiness of your handshake.
Blk is beautiful, but business is business. Dashikis made in Japan are taken as proof of Pan-African sentiment; debate about the relative revisionism of Marcus Garvey replaced progressive action about anything.
White young people who some years ago were marching militantly
13
in the streets are now running nude on the college grounds, attempting to prove that all men are not created equal.
Those brothers and sisters who were buoyed by the beauty in Blackness now seemed bowled over by the Bumb, bid whist, and Boone’s Farm, or else believe they can smoke America to her knees.
In Black Politics, a decline is more than apparent.
The hillbilly Hitler in Alabama had to fight off BNegro politicians in his state who wanted to be first to give him a rolling start toward the White House in ’76.
In Georgia, I’m proud to say, we turned axe-handles into ashes, and sent the baldheaded bigot back to his backward bycycle riding.

Oakland showed that more and more, voters want candidates with programs and not just promises.
Last November, while the District of Columbia and the free-thinking state of Massachusetts were saving us from total embarrassment, the voters of the Fifth Congressional District of Georgia, mostly white, a combination of uneasy urbanites and satisfied suburban dwellers chose an aggressive, young Black man for Congressman over a candidate who argued for more of the same and business as usual. ] 13
In the 1970 and 1972 Congressional elections, those Americans who longed for cleaner air and water aimed their sights at members of the U.S. House who placed profits over human pleasure, and cleaned house. During most of last year, those forces in America who wanted day care legislations passed, massed their power and saw it through both houses of Congress, only to be thwarted by Presidential veto, and give up the ghost.
[Recently] 3 weeks ago the city of Atlanta made the same wise choice
11 16
Through the late sixties, a movement - lead largely by the young - made the war an issue of public consciousness, forced a sitting President to retire, and reversed the thinking of nearly one-half of the American electorate, but this task is too great for summer soldiers and single issue agitators.
There must be a confluence of all these forces for good from now on. But the forces that want clean air ought not support a man with a dirty heart. Those of us who applaud a Congressman who is right on ] 13 peace pollution ought not vote for him if he’s wrong on pollution people. If your senator is wrong on welfare and but right on rivers, make him right on welfare, too.
Building such a movement is an old and rather faded dream: its chances of success have never been easy, its difficulties have always been immense, but its urgency has never been greater.
We are lead by a government whose highest members stand accused of ""wire tapping, prostitution, procuring, theft, burglary, breaking and entering, perjury,

We need to begin now to register each and every one of the unregistered, and to begin again to try to set up the machinery we so badly need to turn out every voter in every election from now on.
Too many of us believe that the battles won on yesterday are won forever. Too many of us believe that the hard struggles are over. Too many of us believe that prayer will heal everything, and not enough of us believe that God helps those who help themselves.
Let me leave you with some words from a distinguished Black man who lived in this country over 100 years ago.
His name was Frederick Douglass, and he said then:
17 18
That begins to defuse the urban crisis, to make a look at ] 17 tomorrow more possible.
[illegible]
Those of you who expect your problem to be magically solved, had best take a cue from something Frederick Douglass said 100 years ago:
“He who would be free must strike the first blow. You know that liberty given is never so previous as liberty sought for and fought for. The man who is outraged is the man who must make the first outcry. Depend on it, men will not care much for a people who do not care for themselves. Men will organize to prevent cruelty to animals, for they are dumb creatures, and cannot speak for themselves, but we are men, and men must speak for themselves or we shall not be spoken for at all. We hold it self evident that no class or color should be the exclusive rulers of this country. If there is such a ruling class, there must be, of course, a subject class, and when that condition is established, the government of the people, by the people and for the people will perish from the earth.”

""We must complain. Yes, plain blunt complain, ceaseless agitation, unfailing exposure of dishonesty and wrong - this is the ancient, unerning way to liberty and we must follow is...""
""Next we propose to work. These are the things that Black men must try to do:

to press the matter for stopping the curtailment of our political rights;
to urge Negroes to vote intelligently and effectively;
to push the matter of civil rights;
to organize business cooperation;
to build school houses and increase the interest in education;
to bring Negroes and labor unions into mutual understanding;
to study Negro history;


2

to attack crime among us, ... to do all in out power by word and deed to increase the efficiency of our race, the enjoyment of its manhood rights and the performance of its just duties.""

This is a large program. It cannot be realized in a short time...this is the critical time.""

What was true for Dr. DuBois 70 years ago is sadly true for us today.
The battles that had to be fought nearly 3/4 of a century ago must still be fought now.
We are living in a city where Black political power reigns supreme.
Our congressman is Black.
Two of our country's state senators are Black.
A near dozen of our country's state representatives are Black.
Two of our county commissioners are Black.
Our mayor is Black.
One half of our city council is Black.
More than half of our school board is Black.
There is no other city in American which political power is so firmly held in Black hands, where honesty and firmly and openly Black people pursued a corner of the American dream and won it.
3
Now that the initial skirmish in a long war is over, the battle has begun.
This is a battle fought on several fronts, for the minds of men, for their pocketbooks, and for their very souls.
We are quickly discovering that the political victory won at the polls was the easiest of all, won with the least effort against the smallest odds.
When Sam Massell defeated the downtown business interests and became mayor in 1969, he did more than defeat the might of the Atlanta Daily Newspapers and the not-too latent anti-semitism that runs rampart through the corporate chambers and all white board rooms of this city; by becoming the first mayor of Atlanta to win with more Black votes than white votes he broached a wall that had stood solid since the days of Booker T. Washington Atlanta Compromise speech, when some Black southerners traded potential power for profit in the mercantile world.
The twist of fate that saw Massell oppose Jackson four years later threw many of the dispossesed downtowners into a dilemma - whether to support the Black man or the Jew, the infidel or the heathen.
Jackson triumphed, and the die was cast, the second battle against the second reconstruction begun.
The leading force was to be the newspapers, the organs of priviledge and special interest.
How did they achieve this power?

During the late 1930s Ohio investor James M. Cox began expanding into the South with his purchase of The Atlanta Journal. Not long after, Cox bought out his competitor, the Hearst Chain's Atlanta Georgian, and simply shut down their presses. In 1952, he bought the Atlanta Constitution, and through the Affiliated Cox Broadcasting Company, now owns W.S.B. Television and W.S.B. Television and W.S.B. AM and FM radio. From its Atlanta headquarters, the intricate Cox conglomerate now controls twelve newspapers (ten in the South), five television and nine radio stations, plus a sprawling cable TV interest, a technical book publishing company and a movie production outfit.
This is monopoly at its worst. In brief, one set of elderly white men controls entirely what most of the citizens of Atlanta read, hear and see. Such a system exists in Russia and China where it is called by its proper names -- dictatorship and thought control. Here we call it free enterprise.
It is no accident that the editor of the morning paper will soon become editor of the flagship in the Hearst chain - a group of papers described by one critic as ""a naked woman running down the street with her throat cut.""
This controlled monopoly press has attempted almost daily to destroy any public faith in Black elected officials in Atlanta - through innuendo and character assasination, through deceit and turned every attempt made by the mayor to place Black faces at the table where the goods are handed out.
5
Through racist caricatures on the screen and in print, we are reduced to Amos and Andy figures, step-an-fetchit fools tapdancing to Dixie played by the press.
In all candor, we must admit that some of us make it easy - too many of us use the sorry excuse that ""white people have been doing this for years: its our turn now.""
It never will be our turn to lie or chear or steal - having a white Nexon ought not pave the way for a Black one.
If having Black faces in high places means anything at all, it must be that our voters expect something different - they expect we who serve them to maintain a standard higher than those whose places we have taken.
Another attack comes from those who would dilute the power we've won after so many years.
Most of the discussion about annexation stems from the displeasure seen across the state with Black men exercising power.
The tradgedy is that Atlanta does need expansion, that this several-county-area has too many governments, and that sober discussion of these issures is clouded by white flight and white fright.
Finally, we are discovering that while political power can be shared when power demands, economic power must be taken.
6
With the airport contract, the argument is whether 4 Black firms can split $10 million dollars of a $400 million dollar contract - that's right, whether we can have 1/4th of 4.1% of the total cost.
There are indeed people in Atlanta who don't want people who look like us to have 1/4th of 4.1% of tax generated revenues spent on public works.
On the city council, their names are Lambros, Guthman, Fowlkes and Cotsakis.
In the press, their names are Journal and Constitution. 
In the city, their names are Legion. 
Again, we make it easy for ourselves to become victim - over 70,000 of us are unregistered to vote here, and therefore unable to choose who represents us where. 
We have a tremendous task ahead. 
We must suceed. 
We can begin now to set new goals for those who rule us. 
We must begin now to create a world in which priviledge is passed to the many and not reserved for the few, where goods and services are shared by all. 
What could such a world provide?

Income and wealth re-distributed through a tax structure that reduces the disparity between the needy and the greedy; 
The elimination of poverty through a program of full

7

employment, supplemented by negative income tax for workers earning on the margin;
An educational system that dignifies vocational and academic training and allows each person to reach their natural potential;
Free health care for every American, financed by the National Treasury and not by profit making insurance companies;
National, regional or municipal ownership or vital services based on need, not profit.

It is possible to create a new world, but we must begin now.

The statistics show that Morehouse men today are more likely now to go into business than any other field of endeavor, but a look at some of the alumni gathered here shows that public service and the ministry are attractive professional goals. Rev. Phale Hale who couldn't be with us today is in both - an active pastor of a large church and a vigorous member of the Ohio legislator - - - - - - -
When my secretary was typing the remarks I'm going to give you today, she said: ""Morehouse men surely are cocky.""
It isn't true that there's a course in ""cockiness"" taught in the basement of Graves Hall, but Morehouse men do learn that the school has a lot to be cocky for.
I entered Morehouse in 1957 and graduated in 1971 - those 14 years - not all of them spent in the classroom.
I learned that the from Dr. Brazeul that a Morehouse man carried three handkerchiefs - one for the young lady from Spelman you are with, one for show, and one to blow.
From my fellow students I learned that you could not successfully carry a full package of cigarettes from Yates and Milton's to the units without putting them in your socks. 
From Pop Dausby I learned what math was all about - as Pop used to say we could use our books on tests or even copy from our neighbor, but if you didn't have it, you didn't have it.
Dr. McBay taught me in one semester that I would never be a chemistry student. 
And most importantly, for the purposes of this gathering today, G.L. Chandler taught me the 3 principles of successful speechmaking:
if you want to be seen, stand up.
if you want to be heard speak up.
if you want to be appreciated, shut up.
[The rest is typewritten.]
Nearly 75 years ago, Dr. W. E. B. DuBois tried to define what a school like Morehouse should be. He said then:
""A university is a human invention for the transmission of knowledge and culture from generation to generation, through the training of quick minds and pure hearts, and for this work no other human invention will suffice.....""
""All men cannot go to college but some men must; every isolated group or nation must have its yeast, must have the talented few, centers of training where men are not so mystified and befuddled by the hard and necessary toil of earning a living, as to have no aims higher than their bellies and no god greater than gold."" *
Dr. DuBois believed that a talented tenth of Black men ought to be educated to lead the race.
The more than 100 public and private Black schools in America have done just that for over 100 years. 
Begun in 1867 to give ex-slaves and their sons the tools to take from freedom what they could by thought and plan, Morehouse has
2
grown from a church basement in Augusta to the campus on Fair Street today.
Along that 100 year path it became: 

one of four Black or white schools in Georgia with a chapter of Phi Beta Kappa;
the greatest producer among all Black colleges in graduate and professional degree holders;
the leader among all Black colleges in doctorates on its faculty;
the leader among all Black colleges in producing doctors and dentists;
the leader among all Black colleges in producing college presidents.

But the achievement of schools like Morehouse is more than position or degrees held by its graduates or faculty.
Despite the nationally stated goal of equality of education, these schools have educated us when no one else would. Whether we arrived with tuition in hand or an empty hand held out, they took us in and turned us out finished men and women. They seldom turned us away. Even today one-third of all Blacks who enjoy any higher education at all do so at the historically Black institutions.
Martin Luther King and Maynard Jackson couldn't go to Emory or Georgia Tech; but Morehouse took them in.

And these schools--public and private--have done this job of providing our talent through times that have never been good times.
Born--most of them--from the ashes of the war-torn South, they faced then--and many still do--the unending hostility of the surrounding locale.
Their students came from schools not meant for education, formed by a system separate and never equal, students whose schools closed when King Cotton called, taught by teachers paid less than white high school janitors, reading books discarded by Robert E. Lee High School, schools with no blackboard, no library, no laboratory and no lavatory, and still they came.
In the ten years after the Civil War, Morehouse, Talladega, Philander Smith, Howard University, Florida A & M, Atlanta University, Clark College, Kentucky State, Natchez Junior College, Rust College, Lincoln University (Mo.), Barber-Scotia College, Bennett College, Johnson C. Smith College, Shaw University, Allen University, Benedict College, Claflin College, Fisk University, Knoxville College, LeMoyne-Owen College, Meharry Medical College, Paul Quinn College, Wiley College, Virginia Union and Hampton Institute all were founded.
Those ten years, few in number, fleeting and fragile, were the only ten years in American history when Black men and women began to enjoy the same rights in Mississippi that were always guaranteed in Maine.

The 1867 Reconstruction Act provided the framework for the freedom fought for in the war. Black men sat in the state legislatures, constructed constitutions for the southern states, and most importantly, began and strengthened the public schools in their states. 
Then as now, education was to be the tool to open doors closed shut on Blacks.
But despite the political successes of the Reconstruction decade, it failed to provide economic security for the freedmen and forced them to submit again to their old masters.
Economic slavery was followed by political subjugation, and the gains of that decade were reversed. 
Remaining were the schools--small, always under financed, struggling to survive.
From then until now they gave us our teachers, doctors, lawyers, ministers--the men and women who have guided our lives, set out standards, planned our future. 
In this region, Morehouse has provided a leadership corps that makes the difference between progress and stagnation for the Black people of five states. 
In Detroit, Morehouse numbers among its alumni 22 doctors and dentists, nine ministers and eight lawyers. 
They include Judge George Crockett, a Morehouse trustee; Forest Green, Detroit's Ombudsman; George Edwards, State Representative; and Samuel Turner, Wayne County Commissioner.
5
In Ohio, Morehouse men include Vernon Odom, head of Akron's Urban League Toledo judge Robert U. Franklin and State Representative Reverend Phale D. Hale and Judge Leo Jackson. In this city alone, the men of Morehouse are proud to claim Dr. Butler A. Jones, Chairman of the Sociology Department at Cleveland State; Rev. James O. Stallings, Executive Secretary of the Cleveland NAACP; County Court Judge Leo Albert Jackson; former legislator William B. Saunders; and Rev. Otis Moss, whose accomplishments are too numerous to mention here. 
In Milwaukee, a Morehouse man, William Gore, sits on the Fire and Police Commission; in Dayton, Marshall Grigsby is with the American Association of Theological Schools and Frank B. Heard is registrar at Wilberforce University; in Gary, Aaron Battle is Deputy Superintendent of Schools, and Walter Hill is Executive Director of the Ann Arbor Community Center. 
In Chicago, Morehouse man Lerone Bennet is Senior Editor of Ebony and Bob Johnson Senior Editor of Jet and Associate Publisher of Johnson Publishing Company; Robert Smith III is Director of the Martin Luther King Health Center; Toussaint Hale is Assistant Personnel Director of the First National Bank; Julius Newborn is Director of Woodlawn Academy; James TO Wardlaw is Regional Director of the U.S. Labor Department's Office of Federal Contract Compliance; Bismark Williams is Associate Dean of Academic Affairs at Roosevelt University; Eric Winston is Vice President for Student Affairs and Dean of Students

at Chicago State; Gabriel Alexander is Chief Fiscal Officer and Assistant to the President at Olve-Harvey College---the list goes on. 
In Dallas, Texas--and Dallas, Georgia--in Paris, Texas, and even in Paris, France, Morehouse men teach and preach and make law and heal bodies as Dr. DuBois envisioned they would. 
Last year more than 1,000 young men, from 30 states and 13 foreign countries studied at Morehouse. 30% of them come from families earning less than $3,000.00 a year; another 30% come from homes where less than $6,0000.00 a year is earned. 
Over 70% of them must receive assistance to stay in school, and yet they promise to become, if they follow the record of the past:

a winner of the Nobel Prize
a college or university president
a newspaper editor
a civil rights lawyer
a bank president

16% of them will go into business; 14% into education; 12% into medicine; 15% into government service on a local, state or national level, 5% into law, 4% into social work, 4% into dentistry, and so on. 
They compose our talented tenth, and with your assistance that tenth can become a fifth and a quarter and a half and a whole, one hundred per cent for us in Cleveland, Detroit, Toledo--in every place where we are.

Dr. DuBois said it best:
""We are on the threshold of a new era. Let us not deceive ourselves with outworn ideals of wealth and servants and luxuries, reared on a foundation of ignorance, starvation and want.""
""Instinctively, we have absorbed these ideals from our twisted white American environment. This new (economic) planning is not for us unless we do it. Unless the American Negro today, led by trained university men of broad vision, sits down to work out by economics and mathematics, by physics and chemistry, by history and sociology, exactly why and how he is to earn a living and how he is to establish a reasonable life in the United States and elsewhere, .....""
""Here, then, is a job for the American Negro University. It cannot be successfully ignored without the growing menace of disaster. I lay the problem before you as one which you must not ignore."" **

Nearly 75 years ago, Dr. W.E.B DuBois tried to define what a school like Morehouse should be. He said then:
""A university is a human invention for the transmission of knowledge and culture from generation, through the training of quick minds and pure hearts and for this work no other human invention will suffice....""
""All men cannot go to college but some men must; every isolated group or nation must have its yeast, must have for the talented few, centers of training where men are not so mystified and befuddled by the hard and necessary toil of earning a living, as to have no aims higher than their bellies and no God greater than Gold."" *
Dr. DuBois believed that a talented tenth of Black men ought be educated to lead the race.

Russwurm.
When he formed his own paper, the North Star, 20 years later, Frederick Douglass wrote in its first editorial what ought to become guiding principles for every Black journalist from then until now. He wrote:
"".....the man who has suffered the wrong is the man to demand redress, - the man struck is the man to cry out - and that he who has endured the cruel pangs of slavery is the man to advocate liberty. It is evident that we must be our own representatives and advocates, not exclusively, but peculiarly - not distinct from, but in connection with our white friends. In the grand struggle for liberty and equality now waging, it is meet, right and essential that there should arise in our ranks authors and editors, as well as orators, for it is in these capacities that the most permanent good can be rendered to our cause."" *

2
The very names of these early papers--Freedom's Journal and North Star--made the reader know that they intended to outline the battlefield and record the war that was sure to follow. And that they did.
Through Civil War and world wars, through depressions and stagflation, the Black press has served to guide and illustrate our path.
Today ""the press"" means more than newspapers. It means radio and television, and Blacks increasingly are a larger and larger part of it.
In ownership we are represented only in the printed press and some few radio stations; in employment, our numbers, however small, are greater now than ever before. In the 150 years since Freedom's Journal first appeared, we have made some notable advances.
We've moved from the back of the bus to the front, from the Jim Crow gallery to front row seats, from the take out window to the lunch counter seat.
At the same time, we've moved from cotton field to unemployment line, from being first in war to being last in peace, from being last hired to being first fired, from segregated schools administered by us to ignorant academies on a yellow school bus, from no right to vote to no candidate to vote for.
For every gain there seems to have been a loss.
3
But despite a 10-year increase of 150% in the number of Blacks holding office, despite the ability to sit or eat or ride or vote in places that formerly lacked Black faces, in a real way we find our condition unchanged.
A quick look at every statistic that measures how well or poorly a group of people is doing--infant mortality rates, median family income, life expectancy--shows that while our general condition has improved, our relative condition has actually worsened.
It is almost as though we were climbing a molasses mountain dressed in snowshoes, while everyone else rides a rather leisurely ski-lift to the top. Now the ski slopes are more treacherous and the molasses melting into mud, a Sargasso sea of crime in high places, of joblessness for many and hopelessness for more.
Yesterday's gains become suspect. The bus front seat loses meaning for a people whose longest trip is likely to be from the feudal system of the rural South to the mechanized, high-rise poverty of the North.
The right to vote loses meaning for a people forced to choose between tweedledum and tweedledee.
The struggle of the Sixties were carried forward against discrimination in housing, employment, education and government, both because the victims became their own best champions and because they found a sympathetic ear in the body politic.
4
But as the demands became more strident, as a foreign war drained our treasury and manhood, as the best and brightest were beaten down by bullets, a shift occurred in the national consciousness.
We stand now near our 200th birthday as a nation--afraid of what the future will bring and afraid to look too critically at our past, afraid to assign guilt and responsibility for our common condition.
A look backward shows decades of movement, agitation and protest whose results are suspect today.
So much has happened in the United States since the beginning of this decade.
A monstrous war slaughtered our young. Those who survived the bombs and bullets came home to a country that yawned in their faces. No jobs! No sympathy! Not even a parade! What Johnny came marching home to this time...from Detroit to Dubuque...was a roaring recession and an overheated, inflationary economy. And guess who was getting burned?
Watergate became more than an apartment building to live in. Richard Nixon turned it into a shameful night mare we were forced to live with. More than just a residential-commercial complex crowded against the banks of the Potomac, Watergate came to symbolize for millions of Americans the lengths to which moronic moral midgets will go to cool their Potomac fever.
5
Our money is becoming counterfeit in world money markets. Our foreign policy bears the stamp of give-away Kissinger's kiss of death. Domestic policy suffers for the lack of any attention at all. Schools no longer educate our young, and our young, knowing nothing, are nodding in the doorways of abandoned cities while hoping things will go better with ""coke"". For Black America, the tentative economic gain of the Sixties are slowly but surely slipping from our grasp. For Black America, it is sadly true, despite the war on poverty which we apparently lost, one-third of all Black children still live in poverty...a fact that bodes ill for future Black generations. It is still true that a Black college graduate stands a great chance of earning less money over a lifetime or employment than will a white high school dropout.
After such a hopeful start on domestic problems in America in the Sixties, it has seemed over the past five years as if a plague has been visited upon us. It is painful I know to plunge headlong back through modern history to view the stark misery of a people about to enter this decade. But think back with me to the year 1970. Think back to where Black America was then so we can gain some sense of where we are likely to be headed.
""Black America in 1970 was weary and frustrated. Old targets of its assaults on racial injustice were becoming more elusive and were changing their shapes through clever disguises. Demonstrations for pure civil rights causes resulted in fewer
6
concessions. Charismatic Black leaders, once able to stir national conscience at a command, had gone to the mountaintop. Riots proved ruinous. Rhetoric was boring. Voices of old allies were raised in eulogy of 'the movement'.
""Cynicism enveloped Black America like a fog, so sure were Blacks that we had been assigned a place near the bottom of the list of national priorities. For we Blacks knew that our aspirations remained unfulfilled, and we knew that minority participation in the affairs of the nation was still circumscribed by a variety of hostile forces. Not the least of the latter was the notion in white America that litigation and legislation of the Sixties has lifted the Black man's burden; that it was now time to back away from so-called Black programs and to turn with some urgency to 'business as usual'.
""But a few Black Americans were not about to release the nation from the commitments it made at the new frontier and in the great society. Too much was possible to tolerate a total retreat from the social, economic and political liberation of Black America. So its men of letters, its political pragmatists, its street-wise civil rights activists, even some of its more loyal while allies, came at once to a firm resolve: that the 1970's could be as good a time as any to rouse the minority community and turn it on to politics and the rewards of political participation.

""This time political participation was to mean more than registering and voting; more than suffering the humiliation of having to choose between two evils at the polls. This time, Black political strategists intended that Black men and women should seek public office on a large scale, attracting broad-based, multi-racial support by an informed and intelligent discussion of issues that cut across ethnic, economic and political lines."" **
And so it came to pass! Politics and political participation did become the new cutting edge of the civil rights movement along with the Black economic thrusts that have aimed at liberation on another level. But Black politics has been the more spectacular of the two in growth and influence.
Since 1969, for example, Black elected officials in America have increased in number by more than 152 percent, or to more than 3,200 officeholders. Of that number, more than 120 are mayors of cities and towns. A full one-third of these mayors preside over cites and towns that are nowhere close to being all-Black. And of the top ten cities in America by population, Blacks are mayors of three of them--Los Angeles, Detroit, and Washington, D.C., the nation's capitol; 17 Black men and women are seated in the U.S. House of Representative; one Black man is an influential member of the United States Senate; two Black men are lieutenant governors
8
in states where the Black population of both do not equal 20 percent, or anywhere near that figure; three hundred Black men and women are state legislators; almost 1,200 Blacks are members of city councils or county governing bodies; nearly 800 Blacks, if not more, help to determine public education policy as members of local school boards.
Ten years ago in the South before the Congress passed the Voting Rights Act of 1965, to be Black and to attempt to even try to register to vote invited punishment, including death, that was guaranteed to be swift, certain and severe. Men and women died, literally died in America, for merely petitioning for Blacks to enjoy a basic right that seemed to flow to everybody else from the Constitution of the United States.
Today more than half of all Black elected officials in the United States are in the southern states...in the very area where fifteen years ago it was not uncommon for Blacks to be asked how many bubbles there are in a bar of soap as a prerequisite for registering. And now there are those of us who are beginning to wonder if a special law is not needed to prod the northern states into the 20th century of Black politics. After all, there are at least seven Black mayors in Alabama, while there is only one in all of New York state; 61 Blacks sit on city councils in Mississippi but there is none on the council in Boston, the cradle of liberty.
Yet for all this motion, let us be careful not to assume that all this represents spectacular progress for Black America.
9
Put it into some kind of perspective. The more than 3,200 Black elected officials in America represent less than one percent of the more than 500,000 elected officials in the country.
And while all comparisons tend to be odious, a look at Blacks during the Reconstruction era is instructive. There were 30 Blacks in the Mississippi state legislature in 1870; for the moment there is only one. When 20 Black men and women were elected last November to the Georgia House of Representatives, we were elated--until we checked the record and discovered that there were 26 Blacks in the Georgia house in the 1870's. Thirteen Blacks in the South Carolina House of Representatives today are a vast improvement over none in 1969. But during Reconstruction, Blacks held 84 seats in South Carolina legislature--a clear majority--not to mention the positions Blacks held as lieutenant governor, secretary of state, state treasurer, associate justice of the state Supreme Court, and others. South Carolina also sent eight Blacks to Congress during that period. So, you see, in many respects we are struggling today to catch up with our political past.
Through all this struggle, it is impossible to overemphasize the power of the media. It is the central nerve of the nation. It influences the way we look at the world. More importantly, it influences the way we look at ourselves. Its impact is felt on virtually every aspect of American life--the way we relate to each other, the way we educate our children, our relationship to our
10
environment, who we elect to public office, and what we eat.
Surveys tell us that almost every home in the United States has at least one television or radio set, which when combined, account for the bulk of the average American's leisure time.
Credit must be given to those few brave souls who trooped into Mississippi and Alabama and Georgia in the '60s to tell a horrified nation what those of you who lived here had known all along--that life for some Black Americans was a constant hell.
But by and large, throughout the Black struggle, the media's role is best described by the 1968 National Advisory Commission on Civil Disorders. They said:
""News organizations have failed to communicate to both their Black and white audiences a sense of the problems America faces and the source of potential solutions. The media report and write from the standpoint of the white man's world. The ills of the ghetto, the difficulties of life there, the Negro's burning sense of grievance are seldom conveyed. Slights and indignities are part of the Negro's daily life, and many of them come from what he now calls the 'white press'--a press that repeatedly, if unconsciously, reflects the biases, the paternalism, the indifference of white America.

11
This may be understandable, but it is not excusable in an institution that has the mission to inform and educate the whole of our society.""

Lerone Bennett said it better. He said ""...White oriented media are part of the race problem. They reflect the interests, values and aspirations of white people...We face the need for white-oriented media to transcend the limitations of whiteness...""
Even though a far greater number of us have had bylines in the press since 1967, the American Society of Newspaper Editors reported last year that fewer than 1% of professional newsmen in America came from minority groups.
Where we are making some gains is in broadcast media, but at the same time we must oppose vigorously the recent Federal Communications Commission proposal to exempt 3/4ths of all radio and television stations in America from its fair employment reporting requirements, and will leave 45,000 jobs outside their scrutiny.
If successful, it will mean that Blacks in radio and television will remain just faces and voices, presence without power.
Even more frightening for all Americans is the growing concentration of many media outlets in the hands of the few.
In just the southern states, eight companies own more than 65 newspapers, including the capitol city newspapers in Georgia, Alabama, Virginia and Florida. These same eight companies own
12
twenty-two southern AM and FM radio stations, and ten southern television stations.
In eight of the top ten cities in the South, the same people own a newspaper and a television station. In three Mississippi cities, newspaper, radio and television stations are held in the same hands. In Greenwood, Hattiesburg, Jackson and McComb, the same people own the newspapers. In Hattiesburg, and Meridian, the same people own one of the television stations.
In 1974, 248 of the 430 daily newspapers in the South were controlled by companies owning more than one newspaper; in the same year, companies with interests in two or more television stations owned 126 of the South's 225 stations.
In my home town, Atlanta, the same people own both daily newspapers, the largest market television station and the largest market AM and FM radio stations. If that situation existed in Russia or China, they'd call it dictatorship, or thought control; here we call it free enterprise.
All this means is that despite advances in employment in the electronic and printed press, and in spite of some advances in society generally, we are increasingly having information about ourselves controlled by fewer and fewer people.
That is where real power lies, and we must construct the means to fight it.
13
That in turn means the construction among us of a national movement to insist on certain basic themes that must be accepted by all of us. They would include:

income and wealth redistribution through a tax structure that reduces the disparity between the needy and the greedy;
the elimination of poverty through a program of full employment supplemented by a negative income tax for workers on the margin;
an educational system that dignifies vocational as well as academic training, and permits each American to realize full potential;
free, adequate health care for all Americans, financed through the national treasury and not profit-making insurance companies;
effective social control of monopoly, and
national, regional or municipal ownership of vital services operated for need, and not for profit.

These promise no perfect world, but do hold out the hope that man can create a system of law and relationships between men that promise more than our present system of privilege for a few.
That is a major task for us all, and one that cannot be pursued by a divided people.
14
We ought to be reminded of some words from Dr. W. E. B. DuBois nearly half a century ago:
""We are American Negroes. It is beside the point to ask whether we form a real race. Biologically we are mingled of all conceivable elements, but race is psychology, not biology, and psychologically we are a unified race with one history, one red memory, one revolt. It is not ours to argue whether we will be segregated or whether we ought to be a caste. We are segregated; we are a caste. Our problem is: how far and in what way can we consciously and scientifically guide our future so as to insure our physical survival, our spiritual freedom and our social growth? Either we do this or we die. There is no alternative. If America proposed the murder of our group, its moral descent into imbecility and crime and its utter loss of manhood, self-assertion and courage, the sooner we realize this the better. By that great line of McKay 'If we must die, let it not be like hogs.' But the alternative of not dying like hogs is not that of dying or killing like snarling dogs. It is rather conquering the world by thought and brain and plan; by expression and organized cultural ideals. Therefore, let us not beat futile wings in impotent frenzy; but carefully plan and guide our segregated life, organize in industry and politics to protect it and expand it. What will be, no one knows. It may be a great physical segregation of the world along the color line;
15
it may be an economic rebirth which insures spiritual and group integrity and physical diversity. It may be utter annihilation of class and race and color barriers in one ultimate mankind, differentiated by talent, susceptibility and gift--but any of these ends are matters of long centuries and not years. We live in years, swift, flying, transient years. We hold the possible future in our hands, but not by wish and will, only by thought, plan and organization."" ***

Russwurm.
When he formed his own paper, the North Star, 20 years later, Fredrick Douglass wrote in its first editorial what ought to become guiding principles for every Black journalist from then until now. He wrote:
""...... The man who has suffered the wrong is the man to demand redress, - the man struck is the man to cry out - and that he who has endured the cruel pangs of slavery is the man to advocate liberty. It is evident that we must be our own representatives and advocates, not exclusively, but peculiarly - not distinct from, but in connection with our white friends. In the grand struggle for liberty and equality now waging, it is meet, right and essential that there should arise in our ranks authors and editors, as well as orators, for it is in these capacities that the most permanent good can be rendered to our cause.""*

2
The very names of these early papers--Freedom's Journal and North Star--made the reader know that they intended to outline the battlefield and record the war that was sure to follow. And that they did.
Through the Civil War and the world wars, through depressions and stagflation, the Black press has served to guide and illustrate our path.
Today ""the press"" means more than newspapers. It means radio and television, and Blacks increasingly are a larger and larger part of it.
In ownership we are represented only in the printed press and some few radio stations; in employment, our numbers, however small, are greater now than ever before. In the 150 years since Freedom's Journal first appeared, we have made some notable advances.
We've moved from the back of the bus to the front, from the Jim Crow gallery to front row seats, from the take out window to the lunch counter seat.
At the same time, we've moved from cotton field to unemployment line, from being first in war to being last in peace, from being last hired to being first fired, from segregated schools administered by us to ignorant academies on a yellow school bus, from no right to vote to no candidate to vote for.
For every gain there seems to have been a loss.
3
But despite a 10-year increase of 150% in the number of Blacks holding office, despite the ability to sit or eat or ride or vote in places that formerly lacked Black faces, in a real way we find our condition unchanged.
A quick look at every statistic that measures how well or poorly a group of people is doing--infant mortality rates, median family income, life expectancy--shows that while our general condition has improved, our relative condition has actually worsened.
It is almost as though we were climbing a molasses mountain dressed in snowshoes, while everyone else rides a rather leisurely ski-lift to the top. Now the ski slopes are more treacherous and the molasses melting into mud, a Sargasso Sea of crime in high places, of joblessness for many and hopelessness for more.
Yesterday's gains become suspect. The bus front seat loses meaning for a people whose longest trip is likely to be from the feudal system of the rural South to the mechanized, high-rise poverty of the North.
The right to vote loses meaning for a people forced to choose between tweedledum and tweedledee.
The struggles of the Sixties were carried forward against discrimination in housing, employment, education, and government; both because the victims became their own best champions and because they found a sympathetic ear in the body politic.
4
But as the demands become more strident, as a foreign war drained our treasury and manhood, as the best and brightest were beaten down by bullets, a shift occurred in the national consciousness.
We stand now near our 200th birthday as a nation--afraid of what the future will bring and afraid to look too critically at our past, afraid to assign guilt and responsibility for our common condition.
A look backward shows decades of movement, agitation and protest whose results are suspect today.
So much has happened in the United States since the beginning of this decade.
A monstrous war slaughtered our young. Those who survived the bombs and bullets came home to a country that yawned in their faces. No jobs! No sympathy! Not even a parade! What Johnny came marching home to this time... From Detroit to Dubuque... Was a roaring recession and an overheated, inflationary economy. And guess who was getting burned?
(X) [This and the other circled X's are handwritten] Watergate became more than an apartment building to live in. Richard Nixon turned it into a shameful night mare we were forced to live with. More than just a residential-commercial complex crowded against the banks of the Potomac, Watergate came to symbolize for millions of Americans the lengths to which moronic moral midgets will go to cool their Potomac fever.
5
Our money is becoming counterfeit in world money markets. Our foreign policy bears the stamp of give-away Kissinger's kiss of death. Domestic policy suffers for the lack of any attention at all. Schools no longer educate our young, and our young, knowing nothing, are nodding in the doorways of abandoned cities while hoping things will go better with ""coke"". For Black America, the tentative economic gains of the Sixties are slowly but surely slipping from our grasp. For Black America, it is sadly true, despite the war on poverty which we apparently lost, one-third of all Black children still live in poverty... A fact that bodes ill for future Black generations. It is still true that a Black college graduate stands a great chance of earning less money over a lifetime of employment than will a white high school dropout. (X)
After such a hopeful start on domestic problems in America in the Sixties, it has seemed over the past five years as if a plague has been visited upon us. It is painful I know to plunge headlong back through modern history to view the stark misery of a people about to enter this decade. But think back with me to the year 1970. Think back to where Black America was then so we can gain some sense of where we are likely to be headed.
""Black America in 1970 was weary and frustrated. Old targets of its assaults on racial injustice were becoming more elusive and were changing their shapes through clever disguises. Demonstrations for pure civil rights causes resulted in fewer
6
concessions. Charismatic Black leaders, once able to stir national conscience at a command, had gone to the mountaintop. Riots proved ruinous. Rhetoric was boring. Voices of old allies were raised in eulogy of 'The Movement'.
""Cynicism enveloped Black America like a fog, so sure were Blacks that we had been assigned a place near the bottom of the list of national priorities. For we Blacks knew that our aspirations remained unfulfilled, and we knew that minority participation in the affairs of the nation was still circumscribed by a variety of hostile forces. Not the least of the latter was the notion in white America that litigation and legislation of the Sixties had lifted the Black man's burden; that it was now time to back away from so-called Black programs and to turn with some urgency to 'business as usual'.
""But a few Black Americans were not about to release the nation from the commitments it made at the new frontier and in the great society. Too much was possible to tolerate a total retreat from the social, economic and political liberation of Black America. So its men of letters, its political pragmatists, its street-wise civil rights activists, even some of its more loyal white allies, came at once to a firm resolve: that the 1970's could be as good a time as any to rouse the minority community and turn it on to politics and the rewards of political participation.
7
""This time political participation was to mean more than registering and voting; more than suffering the humiliation of having to choose between two evils at the polls. This time, Black political strategists intended that Black men and women should seek public office on a large scale, attracting broad-based, multi-racial support by an informed and intelligent discussion of issues that cut across ethnic, economic and political lines.""**
And so it came to pass! Politics and political participation did become the new cutting edge of the civil rights movement, along with the Black economic thrusts that have aimed at liberation on another level. But Black politics has been the more spectacular of the two in growth and influence.
Since 1969, for example, Black elected officials in America have increased in number by more than 152 percent, or to more than 3,200 officeholders. Of that number, more than 120 are mayors of cities and towns. A full one-third of these mayors preside over cities and towns that are nowhere close to being all-Black. And of the top ten cities in America by population, Blacks are mayors of three of them--Los Angeles, Detroit, and Washington, D.C., the nation's capitol; 17 Black men and women are seated in the U.S. House of Representatives; one Black man is an influential member of the United States Senate; two Black men are lieutenant governors
8
in states where the Black population of both do not equal 20 percent, or anywhere near that figure; three hundred Black men and women are state legislators; almost 1,200 Blacks are members of city councils or county governing bodies; nearly 800 Blacks, if not more, help to determine public education policy as members of local school boards.
Ten years ago in the South before the Congress passed the Voting Rights Act of 1965, to be Black and to attempt to even try to register to vote invited punishment, including death, that was guaranteed to be swift, certain and severe.

Yet for all this motion, let us be careful not to assume that all this represents spectacular progress for Black America.

That is a major task for us all, and one that cannot be pursued by a divided people.

What will be, no one knows. It may be a great physical segregation of the world along the color line;
15
it may be an economic rebirth which insures spiritual and group integrity and physical diversity. It may be utter annihilation of class and race and color barriers in one ultimate mankind, differentiated by talent, susceptibility and gift--but any of these ends are matters of long centuries and not years. We live in years, swift, flying, transient years. We hold the possible future in our hands, but not by wish and will, only by thought, plan and organization.""

National Association of FM Broadcasters
Mariott Hotel - September 20, 1975
Although your interest lies in a special smaller section of what is called the media, allow me if you will to discuss it all—the papers, radio and television.  
It is impossible to over-emphasize the power of the media. It is the central nerve of the nation. It influences the way we look at the world. More importantly, it influences the way we look at ourselves. Its impact is felt on virtually every aspect of American life—the way we relate to each other, the way we educate our children, our relationship to our environment, who we elect to public office, and what we eat. 
Surveys tell us that almost every home in the United States has at least one television or radio set, which when combined, account for the bulk of the average American's leisure time. It's well known that journalism generally has been shockingly backward in seeking out, hiring, training and promoting Blacks. This tradition of discrimination against Blacks in the media has been largely responsible for the absence of Black faces in city rooms and on television screens. 
Radio—at least AM—has been a slightly different story. Richard Kahlenberg wrote in 1966 that ""due to the nature of American broadcasting (and he was talking mainly about radio), Negroes have found their way into the industry's purview as performers and 
2
sought-after listeners, primarily for economic reasons."" 
He added, ""Very seldom are broadcast owners, white or Negro, seeking to use radio for special pleading or agitation on behalf of the Negro. Indeed, far from being a medium for communicating a specifically Negro viewpoint to a white audience radio has become, because of its commercial nature, a medium by which the white establishment, through advertising, is actually seeking to sell its values to the Negro."" 
During radio's pre-television heyday of the 1930's and early 1940's, local and network broadcasters relegated anywhere from one to three hours a day to Black audiences. On local stations, this usually took the form of recorded blues or spiritual music programs, often with white disk jockeys. On Sunday's religious programming included live broadcasts of Black church services or gospel singers. From time to time, Black talent was featured on radio broadcasts. During the thirties, Count Basie's national popularity was aided in this way. 
Meanwhile, the national networks continued portraying us as ignorant and shiftless in radio comedies such as ""Amos 'n Andy"" and ""The Beulah Show."" 
Post-war radio, then unaffected by television, attempted to appeal to all age groups, rather than specializing as most 
3
radio stations do today, therefore, early Black radio was patterned largely after its general market counterparts. 
Likewise, the radio announcer most likely was a jack-of-all-trades. He broadcast news, wrote commercials, planned special events, conducted interviews. 
As Americans switched to television for entertainment and information during the early fifties, radio was forced to change radically. That change took the form of specialty radio and gave rise to the all-rock, all-jazz, all-classical, all-talk stations. 
To enterprising executives aware of the Black surge in economic power, the all-Black station was a logical specialty. Black-oriented radio spread rapidly in the fifties—first in the North and Midwest, then throughout the South. 
Since the boom of the fifties, the basic format on Black-oriented radio has changed very little—several consecutive rhythm-n-blues or soul recorded music programs throughout the broadcasting day, interrupted by one or two newscasts every hour, maybe a recorded gospel music broadcast and religious programming on Sundays. So, Black radio listeners—no matter our age or preference—find only one type of outlet aimed specifically at us. 
One young Black critic of the medium, William Wright, asked, ""Do we need 24 hours of James Brown?"" 
Answering his own question, he said, ""No we don't. If we're going to talk about freedom and self-determination, we need 
4
to hear our Black heroes performing in other art forms. We need to talk about drug addiction, about slum landlords, about jobs, about education. But the white man gives us 24 hours of soul because it pads his already stuffed pockets and keeps Black people ignorant."" 
My quarrel is not with the music, which I happen to enjoy. My quarrel is with the broadcasters who could offer information and public service without disturbing their profits. The broadcasters who have brainwashed us into accepting nothing but soul are creating a soul music mentality among Black youths. 
It might be useful to recall the words of former F.C.C. Commissioner Nicholas Johnson, speaking in 1968: ""When your listeners are crying out to understand and to be understood, and you keep on spinning the top forty, you may literally find yourself a modern day electronic Nero, playing fiddle music while your own Rome burns."" 
Newsweek magazine reported in 1967 that ""while the money in Black-oriented radio is green, the power is strictly white... there is just one Negro station manager and a few top Negro executives; on many stations, only the disk jockets and janitors are Black."" 
That situation has thankfully changed, but for years, Black employees at white owned facilities advanced to music director, religious program director, or other positions with no executive-level power at most stations. The rare soul station that boasted any kind of news-gathering and compilation system also usually 
5
hired a white news director. A fortunate handful advanced to program director (sometimes called operations manager), usually radio's lowest executive-level slot. 
But the station chief, assistant manager, sales manager, chief engineer positions—where the ultimate decisions were made and the highest salaries were earned—were and still are overwhelmingly white. 
There is no question that Black promotions have soared in the last several years. Today, a large percentage of soul's radio's program directors are Black, and many other top level posts are being integrated. The highly technical chief engineer slot is the area least penetrated by Blacks, however, but many attribute this more to union seniority regulations and past or present union bias than to management's efforts to keep this position lily-white. 
Undoubtedly, the 1968 F.C.C. Equal Opportunity Order spurred broadcasting's fair employment boom. It reads: “Each station shall establish, maintain, and carry out a positive continuing program of specific practices designed to assure equal opportunity in every aspect of station employment policy and practice."" 
Before the F.C.C. made broadcasters open some top jobs to Blacks, some stations would say they didn't have any Blacks qualified for the jobs. And that was probably true, but only because we knew there was no sense training for jobs we weren't going to get anyway.  
6
Even the F.C.C.'s proposed new E.E.O. rules will exempt as much as 78% of the industry from reporting requirements, and will leave 45,000 jobs outside the Commission's scrutiny. 
However, the Black position in radio has improved noticeably. How to we explain this gradual progress? One generally agreed turning point came on July 29th, 1967, when President Lyndon Johnson appointed an eleven person commission to look into the causes of the civil disorders that left dozens dead, hundreds injured, and millions of dollars in damages. Among his specific charges to the Advisory Commission on Civil Disorders, better known as the Kerner Commission, the president specifically included an analysis of the mass media and its impact on race relations. 
In its report eight months later, the Kerner Commission offered three general responses to this charge. The first two dealt with the actual coverage of the preceding summer's civil disorders. The third finding, which the Commission labeled ""ultimately most important,"" was ""... the media have thus far failed to report adequately on the cause and consequences of civil disorders and the underlying problems of race relations."" 
The commission said: 
By and large, news organizations have failed to communicate to both their Black and white audiences a sense of the problems America faces and the sources of potential solutions. The media report and write 

7
from the standpoint of a white man's world. The ills of the ghetto, the difficulties of life there, the Negro's burning sense of grievance are seldom conveyed. Slights and indignities are part of the Negro's daily life, and many of them come from what he now calls 'the white press'—a press that repeatedly, if unconsciously, reflects the biases, the paternalism, the indifference of white America. This may be understandable, but it is not excusable in an institution that has the mission to inform and educate the whole of our society. 

Such critiques of the media were not limited to those who studied the civil disorders of 1967. Ben Bagdikian, a long-time student of media performance, said in 1968:  
Negroes have appeared in the news most often because of crime... This news treatment of the Negro was more persistent and more pernicious than that of any other low income status group... For the average white, Negroes did not go to school, earn scholarships, win election to the hierarchy of the masons, attend P.T.A. meetings, or die peaceful deaths after laudable or even uneventful lives. One wonders what the effects of this have been on white perception 

8
of the Negro, on the Negro's perception of himself, and on the news media's ability to hypnotize itself with its own information. 

It is undeniable that most ghetto residents see the press at one with the police and a general power structure they feel to be oppressive. 
Historian and Ebony editor Lerone Bennett said, ""... White oriented media are part of the race problem. They reflect the interests, values, and aspirations of white people... We face the need for white oriented media to transcend the limitations of whiteness."" 
Even though a far greater number of non-whites have had bylines in the press since 1967, the American Society of Newspaper Editors reported in 1974 that probably no more than 1% of the professional newsroom staff came from minority groups. 
This is indeed shocking, but because print media does not fall under equal employment regulations set down by the Federal Communications Commission, newspapers in this country will probably continue to remain mostly white. 
Where Blacks are making some slight headway is in broadcast media, particularly Black-oriented radio where Blacks have made substantial gains. What about TV? Joel Dreyfuss, writing in The Washington Post, put it this way: “In many ways the influx of Blacks
9
into television becomes a microcosmic study of integration in America, presence without power."" In other words, the communications industry is not going to be more sensitive to the minority experience until members of the minorities attain policy making positions, and so far very few have made it to the executive suites of the mass media. 
Another concern of mine, and I hope yours as well, is the growing concentration of media ownership. This is especially true in the South where expanding newspaper circulation and advertising revenue are attracting buyers who are gobbling up any and all available media outlets. A.J. Liebling once said: “The only man who has a right to a free press is the man who owns one.""  
To show how frightening the situation has become, let these figures sink in. In Alabama, there are two cities where newspaper and television are under common ownership; in Arkansas, one, in Florida, one; in Georgia, two; in Kentucky, two; in Louisiana, two; in Mississippi, three; in North Carolina, two; South Carolina, one; Tennessee, one; Texas, five, and in Virginia and West Virginia, one each. These include eleven Southern cities where newspaper, television and radio ownership are held in single hands. 
In the Southern region, eight conglomerates own more than 65 newspapers, including the capitol city newspapers in Georgia, Alabama, Virginia and Florida. These same eight companies own 
10
twenty-two Southern AM and FM radio stations, and ten Southern television stations. 
One company, for example, owns the Miami News and WIOD AM and WAIA FM in Miami; the Atlanta Journal, the Atlanta Constitution, WSB TV, WSB FM, WSB AM in Atlanta, the Palm Beach News, the West Palm Beach Post-Times, the Daytona Beach News Journal; WSOC TV, WSOC AM, WSOC FM in Charlotte. Elsewhere in the country this same family controlled company owns three more television stations, two more radio stations, and operates 15 CATV systems. 
The Scripps-Howard interests own both daily newspapers in Memphis and WMC TV, WMC FM, AND WMC AM, the Knoxville News Sentinel and WNOX AM, the Birmingham Post Herald; the Covington (Kentucky) Post And Times Star; the El Paso Herald Post, the Fort Worth Press; the Stuart (Florida) News; the Hollywood Sun Tattler and WPTV in West Palm Beach. The list goes on. 
In 1974, 248 of the 430 daily newspapers in the 13-state South were controlled by companies owning more than one newspaper; in the same year, companies with interests in two or more television stations owned 126 of the South's 225 stations, this situation exists in totalitarian states where it is called dictatorship and thought control; here, we call it free enterprise.
Whatever the form of ownership or size of corporation, all of these companies have one thing common. They restrict the
11
number of sources of news and information available to the public. To many critics, including Nicholas Johnson, multiple ownership of so many media outlets ""is greater than a democracy should unknowingly repose in one man or corporation."" 
In recent years, the controversy over newspaper ownership of broadcast licenses in their respective cities has ever been revived, largely by the pressure from the Justice Department and citizens groups, such as the Citizens Communications Center, the National Black Media Coalition, the National Citizens Committee for Broadcasting, and others. 
In fact, efforts by the Atlanta Communications Coalition in 1970 brought about negotiating activity unheard of at the time. For the first time in its history, the F.C.C. granted the citizens groups a month's extension on filing petitions to deny relicensing to 26 stations. All 26 stations reached agreements with the coalition and no challenges were filed. This year, the coalition has already written to all the stations asking about their implementation of the five-year-old agreements. Some stations have simply ignored the agreements they signed. Others have made only token and often temporary cosmetic staff changes. The coalition is now considering two possibilities once the stations have replied to the letters: 1) challenge some stations on grounds they broke agreements they signed in good faith: 2) ask area advertisers not to patronize stations which have broken faith. 
12
The same kinds of citizens activity is going on around the country. 

In Baltimore, the Ebony Collective is training other community groups in media reform and spreading the word about Black airwave rights. 
In Richmond, the Black Broadcasting Coalition is alleging employment discrimination at 17 Richmond stations.  
Affirmative action in programming and equal employment is being pursued by Black groups in Charlotte, Greenville, Durham, Charleston and Columbia—cities in both Carolinas.  
The Jacksonville Black community has a long history of communication organizing. As of January of this year, community-owned C.A.T.V. company, with stock sold at $1 per share, was among the remaining five contenders for the Jacksonville C.A.T.V. franchise. 

In addition to these citizens efforts, the Justice Department is pursuing the issue of cross-ownership. On January 2nd, 1974, it filed petitions with the F.C.C. against the renewal of the broadcasting licenses of the three major publishers—the Pulitzer publishing company and the Newhouse chain in St. Louis, and Cowles Communications in Des Moines—on the grounds that their multi-media ownership represented illegal control of the advertising market in 
13
the two cities. Other suits began piling up at the F.C.C. involving cross-ownership, including one filed by the citizens communications center against the Bluefield, W. VA., W.H.I.S.-TV and its partner, The Bluefield Daily Telegram, both controlled by the Shott family. Poor Blacks and miners represented by C.C.C. charged that the Shotts discriminated against Blacks in employment and programming and used their monopoly control over a good portion of West Virginia's coal fields to block any objective of the ""Miners For Democracy"" campaign to reform the United Mine Workers. 
Finally, under pressure from the courts and the Justice Department to develop some rule on cross-ownership, the F.C.C. reopened hearings in 1974. On January 28th, 1975, it issued a rule ""to prohibit newspapers in the future from acquiring radio or television broadcast stations located in their markets"" and voted ""to require newspapers to divest television or radio stations in sixteen cities"" by 1980, where the only daily owned the only city-wide radio or TV station. Five of the seven newspaper-TV combinations affected were in Southern cities, including Bluefield, W. VA. The others are Anniston, Alabama; Albany, Georgia; Meridian, Mississippi, and Texarkana, Texas. One of the nine newspaper-radio combinations is in the South, in Hope, Arkansas.  
No one should be satisfied with the Commission's new rule and plans are being made now to press for further divestiture of 
14
existing combinations. The media combinations are clearly alarmed, for even with the departure from the F.C.C. of Johnson and Kenneth Cox, the public interest forces are gaining in sophistication and have more clout with the F.C.C than ever before. 
To avert a final showdown, newspaper and broadcast lobbyists are busily reminding politicians of media's crucial role during elections while asking for special legislation to protect their holdings, or at least weaken the power of the F.C.C.  
If the United States is to break the stranglehold corporate syndicates now have on information sources, we must have new legislation. We know these empires will not be given up without a struggle. 
There is an Atlanta disc jockey named D. Robert Scott, the Man Who's Got Everything That's Hot. He likes to say ""Aint nothing to it but to do it, and I got to do it cause I'm so used to it."" 
Your public expects a great deal from you when you use our airwaves, you ought to get used to it.

It is impossible to over-emphasize the power of the media. It is the central nerve of the nation. It influences the way we look at the world. More importantly, it influences the way we look at ourselves. Its impact is felt on virtually every aspect of American life—the way we relate to each other, the way we educate our children, our relationship to our environment, who we elect to public office, and what we eat.

Undoubtedly, the 1968 F. C. C. Equal Opportunity Order spurred broadcasting's fair employment boom. It reads: ""Each station shall establish, maintain, and carry out a positive continuing program of specific practices designed to assure equal opportunity in every aspect of station employment policy and practice."" 
Before the F. C. C. made broadcasters open some top jobs to Blacks, some stations would say they didn't have any Blacks qualified for the jobs. And that was probably true, but only because we knew there was no sense training for jobs we weren't going to get anyway. 
6
Even the F. C. C.'s proposed E. E. O. rules will exempt as much as 78% of the industry from reporting requirements, and will leave 45,000 jobs outside the commission's scrutiny. 
However, the Black position in radio has improved noticeably. How do we explain this gradual progress? One generally agreed turning point came on July 29th, 1967, when President Lyndon Johnson appointed an eleven person commission to look into the causes of the civil disorders that left dozens dead, hundreds injured, and millions of dollars in damages.

The third finding, which the commission labeled ""ultimately most important,"" was ""... The media have thus far failed to report adequately on the causes and consequences of civil disorders and the underlying problems of race relations."" 
The commission said: 
By and large, news organizations have failed to communicate to both their Black and white audiences a sense of the problems America faces and the sources of potential solutions. The media report and write 

7
from the standpoint of a white man's world. The ills of the ghetto, the difficulties of life there, the Negro's burning sense of grievance are seldom conveyed. Slights and indignities are part of the Negro's daily life, and many of them come from what he now calls 'the white press'—a press that repeatedly, if unconsciously, reflects the biases, the paternalism, the indifference of white America. This may be understandable, but it is not excusable in an institution that has the mission to inform and educate the whole of our society.

Historian and Ebony editor Lerone Bennett said, ""...White-oriented media are part of the race problem. They reflect the interests, values, and aspirations of white people.....We face the need for white-oriented media to transcend the limitations of whiteness.""
Even though a far greater number of non-whites have had bylines in the press since 1967, the American Society of Newspaper Editors reported in 1974 that probably no more than 1% of the professional newsroom staff came from minority groups.
This is indeed shocking, but because print media does not fall under equal employment regulations set down by the Federal Communications Commission, newspapers in this country will probably continue to remain mostly white.

To show how frightening the situation has become, let these figures sink in. In Alabama, there are two cities where newspaper and television are under common ownership; in Arkansas, one, in Florida, one; in Georgia, two; in Kentucky, two; in Louisiana, two; in Mississippi, three; in North Carolina, two; South Carolina, one; Tennessee, one; Texas, five; and in Virginia and West Virginia, one each. These include eleven Southern cities where newspaper, television and radio ownership are held in single hands. 
In the Southern region, eight conglomerates own more than 65 newspapers, including the capitol city newspapers in Georgia, Alabama, Virginia and Florida. These same eight companies own 
10
twenty-two Southern AM and FM radio stations, and ten Southern television stations. 
One company, for example, owns the Miami News and WIOD AM and WAIA FM in Miami; the Atlanta Journal, the Atlanta Constitution, WSB TV, WSB FM, WSB AM in Atlanta, and the Palm Beach News, the West Palm Beach Post-Times, the Daytona Beach News Journal; WSOC TV, WSOC AM, WSOC FM in Charlotte. Elsewhere in the country this same family controlled company owns three more television stations, two more radio stations, and operates 36 CATV systems. 
The Scripps-Howard Interests own both daily newspapers in Memphis and WMC TV, WMC FM, WMC AM, and the Knoxville News Sentinel and WNOX AM, the Birmingham Post Herald; the Covington (Kentucky) Post and Times Star; the El Paso Herald Post; the Fort Worth Press; the Stuart (Florida) News; the Hollywood Sun Tattler; and WPTV in West Palm Beach. The list goes on. 
In 1974, 248 of the 430 daily newspapers in the 13-state South were controlled by companies owning more than one newspaper; in the same year, companies with interests in two or more television stations owned 126 of the South's 225 stations. This situation exists in totalitarian states where it is called dictatorship and thought control; here, we call it free enterprise. 
Whatever the form of ownership or size of corporation, all of these companies have one thing in common. They restrict the
11
number of sources of news and information available to the public. To many critics, including Nicholas Johnson, multiple ownership of so many media outlets ""is greater than a democracy should unknowingly repose in one man or corporation."" 
In recent years, the controversy over newspaper ownership of broadcast licenses in their respective cities have been revived, largely by the pressure from the Justice Department and citizens groups, such as the Citizens Communications Center, the National Black Media Coalition, the National Citizens Committee for Broadcasting, and others. 
In fact, efforts by the Atlanta Communications Coalition in 1970 brought about negotiating activity unheard of at the time. For the first time in history, the F. C. C. granted the citizens groups a month's extension on filling petitions to deny relicensing to 26 stations. All 26 stations reached agreements with the Coalition and no challenges were filed. This year, the Coalition has already written to all the stations asking about their implementation of the five-year-old agreements. Some stations have simply ignored the agreements they signed. Others have made only token and often temporary cosmetic staff changes. The Coalition is now considering two possibilities once the stations have replied to the letters: 1) challenge some stations on grounds they broke agreements they signed in good faith; 2) ask area advertisers not to patronize stations which have broken faith. 
12
The same kind of citizen activity is going on around the country.  

In Baltimore, the Ebony Collective is training other community groups in media reform and spreading the word about Black airwave rights. 
In Richmond, the Black Broadcasting Coalition is alleging employment discrimination at 17 Richmond stations.
Affirmative action in programming and equal employment is being pursued by Black groups in Charlotte, Greenville, Durham, Charleston and Columbia—cities in both the Carolinas. 
The Jacksonville Black community has a long history of communications organizing. As of January of this year, community-owned C.A.T.V. company, with stock sold at $1 per share, was among the remaining five contenders for the Jacksonville C.A.T.V. franchise. 

In addition to these citizens efforts, the Justice Department is pursuing the issue of cross-ownership. On January 2nd, 1974, it filed petitions with the F. C. C. against the renewal of the broadcasting licenses of three major publishers—the Pulitzer Publishing Company and the Newhouse Chain in St. Louis, and Cowles Communications in Des Moines—on the grounds that their multi-media ownership represented illegal control of the advertising market in 
13
the two cities. Other suits began piling up at the F. C. C. involving cross-ownership, including one field by the Citizens Communications Center against the Bluefield, W. VA., W.H.I.S.-TV and its partner, The Bluefield Daily Telegram, both controlled by the Shott family. Poor Blacks and miners represented by C. C. C. charged that the Shotts discriminated against Blacks in employment and programming and used their monopoly control over a good portion of West Virginia's coal fields to block any objective of the ""Miners for Democracy"" campaign to reform the United Mine Workers. 
Finally, under pressure from the courts and the Justice Department to develop some rule on cross-ownership, the F. C. C. reopened hearings in 1974. On January 28th, 1975, it issued a rule ""to prohibit newspapers in the future from acquiring radio or television broadcast stations located in their markets"" and voted ""to require newspapers to divest television or radio stations in sixteen cities"" by 1980, where the only daily owned the only city-wide radio or TV station. Five of the seven newspaper-TV combinations affected were in Southern cities, including Bluefield, W. VA. The others are Anniston, Alabama; Albany, Georgia; Meridian, Mississippi, and Texarkana, Texas. One of the nine newspaper-radio combinations is in the South, in Hope, Arkansas. 
No one should be satisfied with the Commission's new rule and plans are being made now to press for further divestiture of 
14
existing combinations. The media combinations are clearly alarmed, for even with the departure from the F. C. C. of Johnson and Kenneth Cox, the public interest forces are gaining in sophistication and have more clout with the F. C. C. than ever before. 
To avert a final showdown, newspaper and broadcast lobbyists are busily reminding politicians of media's crucial role during elections while asking for special legislation to protect their holdings, or at least weaken the power of the F. C. C. 
If the United States is to break the stranglehold corporate syndicates now have on information sources, we must have new legislation. We know these empires will not be given up without a struggle. 
There is an Atlanta disc jockey named D. Robert Scott, the Man Who's Got Everything That's Hot. He likes to say ""Aint nothing to it but to do it, and I got to do it cause I'm so used to it."" 
Your public expects a great deal from you when you use our airwaves, you ought to get used to it.

Events have moved so quickly in the last few days and weeks that we must be careful not to let them sweep us away.
One man was President of the United States; now he has impeached and pardoned himself, has gone into retirement on San Clemente's sunny shores. Discredited as a tax cheat, a liar and a petty thief, excused from punishment for commiting crimes that have filled our jails with men and women not fortunate to be born rich or white or to have been elected to high office.
His successor, a man Lyndon Johnson once said ""couldn't walk and chew gum at the same time"", has apparently started chewing gum again.
[Hand-drawn line here.]
All around the rest of the globe great changes are taking place.
In Africa, the people of Mozambique and Guinea-Bissau are reaching freedom and self determination.
The North Vietnamese are consolidating their earlier victory over American military might and will soon exercise democratic control over their entire nation.
2
In Europe, in Latin America, the struggle for justice and right against oppression and wrong goes on.
Only in America is there hesitation and faltering, uncertainty and indecision. Only here do popular movements among the oppressed rise and fall as regularly as the phases of the moon.
These conditions under which we struggle do not exist in a vacuum; they are part and parcel of a larger picture of powerful forces determined to maintain the status quo.
[Hand-drawn line here.]
What has happened is this: the reins of government have been seized by a massive coalition of the comfortable, the callous and the smug who have closed their minds and hearts to the claims and calls to conscience put forward by the forgotten and unrepresented elements in American society.
This has resulted in the national nullification of the needs of the needy, the gratuitous gratification of the gross and the greedy, a triumph for the politics of penuriousness, prevarication and impropriety, of pious platitudes and self righteous swinishness.
3
Two elections gave them awesome power, the second, a rout that reinstalled the fiscal fascists, the merciless merchants of the cost accounting school of social welfarism in the White House, and insured a four year reign for men with an arrogant contempt for people and their problems.
The late American balladeer Woodie Guthrie once said that some men kill with bullets; others with the stroke of a pen.
Coupled with an impotent Congress, the vetoes, cut-backs, shifts in sharing and reverses in revenue cut sharpest at the people at bottom, those who look to government for help.
But if the Kennedy and Johnson years taught any lesson at all, it was that government, under pressure, would move slowly and ponderously, all too often with all deliberate lack of speed, to become a limited partner of sorts with the American underclass in their struggle to do better for themselves. The last few years have changed all that. The government's attitude changed from benign concern to malignant neglect. 
[Based on the manuscript markings, it is unclear if the following phrase up to the page break is intended to be included or crossed out:]
In the decade of the Sixties, the number of people living in
4
poverty was reduced by nearly one third.
It's not unreasonable at all to ascribe some of these gains to the great society programs of the era.
Yet the cruel and callous castrators moved with cold calculation to kill, freeze or wind down urban renewal, model cities, community action, public service employment, student loans, public housing, federal impact funds for education, and to impose a sixty percent national pull back in social services.
Human problems are now placed on a balance sheet and forced to add up, to pay for themselves. The new administrators run the programs they direct with the solicitude of a hungry mortician at an old folks home.
While the nation waltzed into the Seventies believing that its ""Black"" problem had been blown or burned away, infant mortality rates for us remained twice as high as for everyone else; nearly half of all Black families in the United States earned less than $5000 a year; the average Black American was dying seven years earlier than his white counterpart; we remained last hired and first fired.
5
We are where we are today because of a confluence of events of the Sixties. The nonviolent marches of the first part of that decade were replaced, if not in fact then certainly in the public fancy, by the rapacious rioters in the last part of the Sixties.
America's cities were believed to be either in flames, under martial law, or sinking under the dead weight of a population of pensioners, the unemployed young and their presumably unemployable parents.
The rest of America was running physically and emotionally from social concerns in a crisis state of their own. They rightly perceived that their taxes - higher proportionately than those paid by [illegible] their pernicious president - were escalating to pay for barely maintaining what they had run away from, but were wrongly taught, by their president and others, that their taxes were high because of the lazy poor, and not because of the corporate evader or the military glutton.
The rulers of the cities, on the other hand - the mayors, commissioners, and councilmen - faced an all too common list of plagues we have come to call the urban crisis: drug addition, increased racial friction, civil service militancy, housing destroyed by Plan ""A"" faster than it was
6
constructed by Plan ""B""; schools which warehoused and mis-educated their students, relief rolls giving relief to no one. For them the new federalism promised to be manna from heaven.
It promised new money for them all, money to do what they then could not, money to pave the streets, to pay the police, to clean the air and water.
Instead of manna and millions, it became pennies stolen from the poor, robbing Peter to pay Paul half of what Peter couldn't get by on to begin with.
The result was to shift the burden from the federal government where the resources were to the towns and cities where the resources aren't.
The administration's rhetoric about sharing the wealth became a scandalous exercise in consolidating wealth and power where they always were: away from the cities, away from the children, away from people for whom wealth is an extra meal, and power the ability to hide from the census taker. 
The often repeated connection between today's dilemma and the end
7
of the Reconstruction Era is frightening.
The collusion between a hostile administration and a seemingly unfeeling majority, then and now, seemed to doom the hope of the American underclass.
Then and now, a president desperate for power made an arrangement. Not just with the unreconstructed South, but with the national unreconstructed mentality that believes now - as it did then - that private profit and public arrogance could be pursued at the expense of the people living on the American margin.
Concurrently, the liberal crusaders for social justice and democracy became tired, or involved in other, less traumatic concerns. For many of them, picking up beer cans by the side of the highway became an acceptable substitute to winning jobs in the brewery for Black people.
The aspirations of and movement by Black people began to be curtailed, not just by organized violence and barbarity, but by a series of nationally choreographed legal and extralegal maneuvers designed to make us less than political and economic equals.
8
The frenetic activity of the Sixties created a political movement characterized by selfishness and fear; a political constituency was recruited from the frightened to form solid ranks against the forgotten.
Backlash is too hackneyed a term for people confused by long hair and frightened by clenched fists, their politics misdirected by those who verbally oppose crime in the streets and secretly practice crime in the suites.
This manipulation of the American mind made the mundane magnificent and placed government in the hands of men who believe in privilege for the powerful and neglect of the powerless.
I can think of no better prescription for relieving this crisis, and reviving interest in it, than by creating a partisan national coalition of need, of mothers who want care, not warehousing, for their children, of fathers who want work at a decent wage, of people who work for a living but can't live on what they make as well as those who can't find work but can't live on what we so grudgingly give, those who want an end to welfare and capitalism for the poor and subsidy and socialism for the wealthy and 
9
who must learn that sufficiency for people at the bottom can also mean stability for those in the middle; all those people now live in America, divided now by race and class, fearful of each other, contentious and impotent.
We have just gone Last November, we went through the every-two-year occasion in America when the people, acting in concert, through the electoral process, are supposed  to set their sights on common goals shared and held by us all.
Instead, we saw an election where fewer participated than ever before; where the issues became age and incumbency and allegiance to fallen idols, or contests between the demonstrated failures of one set of hopefuls and the unproved promises of another; nowhere was their there commitment to radical social and economic change of the sort needed to lift the underclass to simple survival level.
An entire political movement came to near maturity in America in the Sixties. Fueled by the fire from the Southern Civil Rights Movement, it threatened to challenge the foundations of monopoly capital, of skin privilege, of the racial arrogance that created vast reservations of the
10
unwanted on this country's soil.
That movement became the victim of its own successes. It fought and won the right to sit in front of the bus, to cast a vote, to sit at a lunch counter. But it failed to sustain that movement, and instead saw it dissipated in struggles on the edge.
Being Black became a rhetorical or sartorial accomplishment. Social commitment began to be measured by the length of your hair or the intricacy of your handshake.
Those young people who some years ago were marching militantly in the streets are now found running nude on the college campus, demonstrating that all men are not created equal.
The political process ought to be put to a year round test, not as a last ditch effort, but as another weapon in an arsenal that has contained more pop guns than Howitzers.
The politics of street protest of the Sixties found that publicly supported inequality at the lunch counter or bus station would yield, after a struggle, but the more sophisticated, institutionalized inequality
11
of the Seventies will not. [Handwritten slash here.]
As America quickly becomes divided into free zones and reservations for the unwanted, it must fight back with the limited resources at its command. Those of you who decide to undertake such a task might be strengthened by some words from the past, from W.E.B. DuBois, who said:
[The following underlines are hand-drawn on the typed pages.] 
""I believe in God who made of one blood all races that dwell on earth. I believe that all men, Black and Brown, and white, are brothers, varying, through time and opportunity, in form and gift and feature, but differing in no essential particular, and alike in soul and in the possibility of infinite development.
Especially do I believe in the Negro race; in the beauty of its genius, the sweetness of its soul, and its strength in that meekness which shall inherit this turbulent earth.
I believe in pride of race and lineage itself; in pride of self so deep as to scorn injustice to other selves; in pride of lineage so great as to despise no man's father; in pride of race so chivalrous as neither to offer bastardy to the weak nor beg wedlock of the strong, knowing that
12
men may be brothers in Christ, even though they be not brothers-in-law.
I believe in service: humble reverent service, from the blackening of boots to the whitening of souls; for work is heaven, idleness hell, and wages is the ""well done"" of the master who summoned all them that labor and are heavy laden, making no distinction between the Black sweating cottonhands of Georgia and the first families of Virginia, since all distinction not based on deed is devilish and not divine.
I believe in the devil and his angels, who wantonly work to narrow the opportunity of struggling human beings, especially if they be Black; who spit in the faces of the fallen, strike them that cannot strike again, believe the worst and work to prove it, hating the image which their maker stamped on a brother's soul.
I believe in the Prince of Peace. I believe that war is murder. I believe that armies and navies are at bottom the tinsel and braggadocio of oppression and wrong; and I believe that the wicked conquest of weaker and darker nations by nations white and stronger but foreshadows the death of that strength.
13
I believe in liberty for all men; the space to stretch their arms and their souls; the right to breathe and the right to vote; the freedom to choose their friends, enjoy the sunshine and ride on the railroads, uncursed by color; thinking, dreaming, working as they will in a kingdom of God and love. 
I believe in the training of children Black even as white; the leading out of little souls into the green pastures and beside the still waters, not for pelf truth; lest we forget, and the sons of the fathers, like Esau, for mere meat barter their birthright in a mighty nation.
Finally, I believe in patience: patience with the weakness of the weak and the strength of the strong, the prejudice of the ignorant and the ignorance of the blind; patience with the tardy triumph of joy and the chastening of sorrow: patience with God.""

What is interesting - and frightening - about the DeFuuis case is the array of forces it attracted as attackers of the system of preferential treatment commonly - and often mistakenly referred to as quotas.
It demonstrated that the drive for educational opportunity fought at this level will be fought by the beneficiaries alone; it will be fought against by many of the former partners in the old liberal coalition that have now demonstrated their interest in equality included equality where there interest was not threatened."

Those two frightening facts, threatening international annihilation or domestic genocide, color our lives.
Their presence is a reflection of everything else American: the sorry conditions of our cities; the dependence of one tenth of our labor force on war spending; the reactionary and impotent stance of the United States Congress; the incredible hunger and malnutrition in the richest country on earth.
There is no escaping the duality of these subjects in a country where more money is spent on pet food than food stamps; where private citizens spend more on tobacco than all government does on education; where airlines and railroads compete for income supplements; where farmers receive welfare payments of one billion dollars a year; where the oil industry in the past ten years received government handouts of upwards of fifty billions of
2
dollars and where supplements for the poor are laughed out of Congress; where five percent of the people have twenty percent of the wealth and twenty percent of the people have five percent of the wealth. There can be no denial that we are a generation of people who may be without a future; we may be living on the edge of domestic as well as world-wide revolution that may destroy us all.
It cannot be a mistake that the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and certain American Capitalists make the same analysis of the United States. That analysis suggests that this country has to maintain its present grip on the economies of the underdeveloped nations of the world or we shall have to lower our standard of living. It may be true that consumption will have to be changed in this nation, both in order to redistribute what there is to be consumed and also in order to have something to be consumed, but it is also true that our preserving this economic advantage is done at a prohibitive cost. ""We cannot afford continued imperialism, either financially or spiritually, without, the nation ceasing to function as a democratic state.""1 
3
The United States of America makes up six percent of the world's population; each year we consume sixty percent of the earth's consumable resources. This fact constitutes the only real threat from the undeveloped world. To imagine that the Vietnamese peasants who successfully resisted domination of their land from any quarter for several hundred years were going to attack Honolulu in concert with the revolutionaries from Cuba is to imagine that the United States constitutes a real threat to all the nations which have expressed a real desire to govern themselves. If we constitute that threat, then the fear is real: if the fear is real, we had better try to dispel it in a way radically different from the gunboat diplomacy of the past.
But it is this concern with the revolutionary activity of the rice farmers of Southeast Asia and the cane cutters and tin miners of South America that has taken our attention from the more serious threat from within; this is not the obviously absurd threat that a minority of Black people will somehow overthrow the government of the United States, but the real fear that the age old division of Black and white and rich and poor
4
will become so pronounced that no bringing together will be possible; that the two separate societies so long in existence in this nation will continue indefinitely with one more closely resembling the colonizer and the other the colonized.
To suggest that these two problems can be attacked separately is to believe one is not a function of the other; no nation which cares for its people can make war on or subvert another; no nation which cares about the individuality of all men could let the people of its own soil exist as some of the people of this nation do.
A superficial solution would suggest that the system functions well, but that it is run now by corrupt men; that representative democracy as we know it can work, but it has somehow gone astray; that people are basically good, but have been led down the wrong path. If that were true, then we would have a simple task indeed. An army of young people and others toppled one president in 1968; that same army could be reconstituted, we could topple this one and many of his underlings, replace them with decent people, and our new world would be secure.
5
But a perfect system ought to work well no matter how imperfect the men in it; radical change in American and foreign and domestic policy takes much more than a reconstitution of the instruments of power as well.
The decision making process which decides to build one anti-ballistic missile, costing eleven billion dollars, needs to be reconstituted. For the dollar price paid for that one piece of already obsolete price of hardware, 400,000 units of low cost housing, 400,000 schoolrooms or 1300 hospitals could be purchased.
These are not powers vested in the Congress solely, but in the bureaucratic agencies of government that change little from president to president. The assumptions and the men that govern their actions change little from year to year. These must be radically altered if the quality of life in this country is to be altered as well.
Could not the $125,000 which Senator Eastland was paid two years ago for not planting cotton have been better spent in resettling dispossessed Black people in that unused land?
Could not the energy which goes into destroying villages thousands
6
of miles away go into building villages here?
We have heard that the Seventies and beginning of the new decade will bring unheralded promise and progress for all Americans; from statesmen and politicians alike, we are told that the next ten years will be the ten years in which the United States truly lives up to its declarations, and the years in which the land of the slave becomes the home of the free.
Now this may very well be so, but the experiences of the last ten years doesn't suggest that it will.
This doesn't mean that man is not a perfectable animal, or that he cannot undertake to correct the centuries of wrong heaped upon men and nations by other men and nations; it is to suggest that some learning from past history will have to be absorbed before a real new future can be begun.
To be sure, our system of government, representative democracy, has seen massive improvements and reforms since it was first instituted. From the days when the right to vote, and thereby participate in government, was limited to white, male property owners, we have seen the franchise enlarged to include women and, all to slowly, even today, Black people.
7
From the days when rural America was majority America, we have seen the slow shift to proper representation on a one-man, one-vote basis.
But to believe that these reforms have brought true democracy to this country, or that simply granting the right to vote to every citizens makes for a responsible and responsive government is to incredibly overstate the case for us to continue business as usual.
These last ten years have demonstrated time and time again how people of the nation, rather than the government of the nation, have had to move to get the action they deserved, expected, needed and were supposed to have by law.
At the beginning of the Sixties, four young Black men in Greensboro, North Carolina took what ought to be considered the first step in bringing a much abused phrase ""participatory democracy"" to the American political scene. They had been preceded, of course, by the thousands of Black people in Montgomery, Alabama who, in 1956, voted with their feet against segregated seating in that city's bus lines, but the action of the Greensboro Four mobilized an unwilling nation into action, spurred a generation of
8
young people into the streets, developed a new consciousness in Black communities and set the example for the rising aggressiveness among young white students.
From lunch counters to bus seats to voting booths to student confrontations to the McCarthy campaign to the convention demonstrations; these have been the manifestations of citizen involvement of the left hand of the spectrum. On the right we have seen the people's politics in the campaign of the hillbilly Hitler from Alabama; the growing militance of white firemen and policement, the reactionary resistance to job equality from white workingmen. In the middle of the spectrum we have seen the growing consumer awareness of the American housewife; the frustrations of the small farmer; the new aggressiveness of the middle and low income workers.
All of these people differ in their motives and goals. Some are driven by fear and selfishness; others are caught in an economic system never meant for their benefit; but all are caught up in believing with every good reason that government does not care for them or listen to their opinions; taken together, although their political differences argue
9
against their ever being together, they constitute a noisy American majority of people, who, if they acted together, could shake the foundations of the nation.
The problem for those interested in political change achieved through political action is how to get these people to act in concert: to vote together, let us say, or to march together, or to demonstrate in unison that they seek common solutions to their common problem, the inhumanity of twentieth century American life and the domestic brutality which results from a brutal and bankrupt foreign policy.
To suggest that there is an easy answer to the problem of bringing these parts together is to constitute a fraud. It will not be done by dismissing blue collar workers as simple racists who vote for George Wallace; a great many voted for Robert Kennedy as well.
It will not be done by suggesting that one group, America's Black people, acting alone can bring about its own deliverance; no group of people with our social identification and lack of power can accomplish that task.
10
It will not be done by engaging in debate or the relative revisionism of Ho Chi Minh while babies starve in the streets, or by suggesting that the security of the campus is the proper place from which to engage in social criticism of people who never see a book from year to year.
It might be done by reminding ourselves of the words of George Wald, a Nobel Laureat in biology, and who said: ""About two million years ago, man appeared. He has become the dominant species on the earth. All other living things, animal and plant, live by his sufferance. He is the custodian of life on earth, and in the solar system. It's a big responsibility.
""The thought that we're in competition with Russians and Chinese is all a mistake and trivial. We are one species, with a world to win. There's life all over the universe, but the only life on the solar system is on earth, and in the whole universe we are the only men.
Our business is with life, not death. Our challenge is to give what account we can on what becomes of life in the solar system, this corner of the universe that is our home; and most of all, what becomes of men... All men, of all nations, colors and creeds. This has become onw world,
11
a world for all men. It is only such a world that can now offer us life, and the chance to go on.""2

2
Since the conference workshops during the next two days will concentrate on every aspect of Black child development, I think it would be appropriate for me to comment on these topics and explore with you some possible solutions to what I consider the most ctritical problem facing Black Americans: the underdevelopment of our most precious resource, Black children. 
Lest my remarks be construed as final pronouncements on the various subjects up for discussion, let me hasten to say that I am not foolish enough to try and compete with the panels of experts.  
My comments for the most part will be thoughts and opinions, backed up in some cases with statistics, but mostly supported by thirty-five years of living, learning and working in a society that rewards some of its young with lavish advantages and punishes others by withholding the basic necessities of life.  
Let's begin with health care and the development of Black children and youth. We already know that poverty, rural residence, environmental 
3
conditions and race are powerful barriers to good health. In 1969, four million Black children lived in poverty. These children continue to suffer from higher rates of infant mortality, with more chronic sickness and disease experienced during childhood, than do whites. According to 1971 health statistics compiled by the Southern Regional Council, if Black infant mortality rates in the South had been equal to white infant deaths, 3,408 Black babies would have survived the first year of life. Black children ages one to four die at a higher rate from accidents, congenital malformations, flu and pneumonia, meningitis and from other causes. 
According to the American Academy of pediatrics' analysis of a 1972 nutrition survey conducted by the Department of Health, Education and Welfare, seventy percent of Black pre-school children living in the South were anemic. 
The nation's health care system makes no attempt to deal with the full range of factors that affect an individual's health. The barriers I have pointed out, poverty, rural residence, race, poor environment, — plus the lack of needed manpower and facilities — are considered beyond 
4
the province of the fee-for-service practitioner. Most federal health programs tend to be dominated by provider rather than consumer interests and are little more than half-hearted assaults on a complex, fragmented system. 
I am also disturbed by some of the proposals for a national health insurance scheme which seemed resigned to simply pouring more money into the present malfunctioning system and hoping this money will trickle down in the form of increased benefits for consumers. 
There is one national health plan that differs substantially from the rest. That is the one that has been introduced by U.S. Representative Ron Dellums and endorsed by the congressional Black Caucus. Six principles from his proposed legislation that have paramount importance are: 

Complete, accessible community based health care for all with no charge for services;
Elimination of profit-making;
5

Financed through fully progressive taxes;
No restrictions on eligibility on benefits;
Control and review of quality by the health professionals as well as community review; and
Strict control over quality price and distribution of all drugs.

No more basic reform is needed than that the health care system devote its energies solely to implementing the right of decent health care for all. Reform of this nature cannot and will not and should not come from the present health establishment. If health care is truly to be a right, the interests of the consumer must be overriding in the system, and health care institutions must be structured to respond to those interests. 
With regard to social services and Black child development, I firmly believe that tfhese should be provided for by the state. In fact, the need for an organization such as the national council for Black
6
Child Development is an admission that the state has failed an important segment of our society. Recognizing that there are numerous state responsibilities relating to Black child development, let me emphasize one that is of critical importance: national comprehensive child care legislation. The need for such legislation is urgent, especially now as the purchasing power of the dollar declines, as more and more families require assistance, such as food, health care, and subsidized services, to meet the basic survival needs of their children. The need for such legislation is especially urgent as the unemployment rolls grow, especially with the increase in male unemployment. The general sense of economic insecurity may well be forcing more mothers to take part-time jobs, and may be keeping more new mothers in the work force after their children are born. 
The federal legislation I envision would provide the framework and the funds for a community to deal with its own most urgent needs: health, nutrition, family support services, outreach, prenatal care,
7
day care, preschool education or whatever other particular needs the community has. 
The principal objective of such federal legislation must be to provide services to families who want and need them in order to meet the comprehensive needs of their children. It must support families. Since child care needs differ from family to family and from community to community, the community itself must be able to assess its overall child care needs, to make local choices about the types of services to be offered, and to determine who within the community should provide those services so that families have options. 
The involvement of parents is critical to the success of any child care program. Psychologists and parents alike have long recognized that a consistent approach to the child is essential for healthy development. Serious damage can occur to a child who encounters conflicting standards at home and at his child care center where goals, expectations, rewards and punishments are established and developed. 
8
It is because comprehensive child development legislation must support families and include parents that the delivery system is so critical. Without getting too specific about delivery of services, I want to emphasize certain objectives any comprehensive child development legislation should meet. It should: 

Include the full range of services which children and families need. 
Provide for community decision making about the types of services to be offered. 
Give parents the central role in the community's decisions about the types of services to be provided and in the day-to-day operation of the programs in which their children are participating. 
Allow enough flexibility to provide parents and families with real options, including services in a variety of settings. For example, in the home, in neighborhood facilities, at places of employment. 
Preserve existing community child care institutions, including head start projects, and assure opportunity for such institutions to
9
	 expand and to receive funds under this legislation. 
Encourage services in settings that support the family and are relevancy to the child's own culture and environment, and that are staffed by people from the child's own community, including parents. 
Include a funded mechanism for enforcing federal standards. 
Provide a mechanism for coordination with other agencies providing services for children in the community, including those provided through public health, education, and welfare agencies and especially those provided with Title XX and head start funds. 

In addition to these objectives for delivery of services, I want to mention two systems of delivery under consideration which I oppose. 
First, a new campaign is underway to place the entire delivery system in the public school system. I am against giving schools the responsibility for a new comprehensive program, when they are far from meeting the responsibilities they already have. 
10
Second, I am concerned about the role of profitmakers in any proposed legislation. Therefore, I believe that public funds to support franchised commercial child care operations should be specifically funded. 
Limiting the program to public and private, nonprofit agencies would not exclude employer-provided child care, not should it eliminate family day care operators, if properly written. 
In addition to the need for comprehensive child development legislation at the federal level, pressure must be brought to bear on local and state levels of government as well. 
As far as state government is concerned, only three states in the Southern region have committed state monies for day care. They are Florida, South Carolina, and Tennessee. I understand that a number of Southern states are turning back Title 4A money that could be matched by state money for the support of day care centers.  
In my own state of Georgia, the Department of Human Resources has put up some monies to be matched with local and federal funds for day
11
care, and I am very hopeful that this amount can be increased in the 1976 budget. I will do everything I can to see that this is accomplished. Nearly sixty percent of revenue sharing funds spent by state governments goes for education: I believe a portion of that amount should go for developmental day care. 
And one last, encouraging, note on day care legislation. Rep. Arie Taylor of Colorado has introduced a childcare bill in the Colorado state legislature which would create an Office of Early Childhood Programs in the Colorado Department of Social Services. I want to learn more about her proposed legislation, and whether it might be appropriate for my state.  
[The previous paragraph is circled.]
I am concerned about the role of public education as it affects Black children's development, for I believe that American public education is failing to prepare its graduates to cope with elementary daily activities. The time honored subjects of study, reading, writing and arithmetic, must be realistically presented and developed in order that 
12
our graduates possess the skills needed to fill out an employment form, read a newspaper, keep the household budget, read a lease or sale contract, and balance a checkbook. For in these times, perhaps the most essential mathematical skill needed is not adding, but subtracting.  
Not only do our schools sometimes fail to educate students, but we are finding more and more evidence to support the charge by the Southern Regional Council's School Desegregation Project that racial discrimination and arbitrary actions of school authorities in desegregated Southern schools are resulting in a phenomenon known as the ""student pushout."" 
Leon Hall, Director of the School Desegregation Project, defines the pushout as a student who has been expelled or suspended from school under questionable circumstances, or who, because of intolerable hostility directed against him or her, finally quits school.  
In testimony presented last May before the House Subcommittee on
13
Equal Opportunities, Hall said, ""In human terms, pushouts caused by discrimination result in large numbers of young people who lose hope and are marked by despair and bitterness. Often they graduate into the worlds of drugs, unemployment and welfare, contributing to the delinquency problem which is the subject of this hearing. Systems which produce large numbers of such persons are indefensible. As well, they produce great social costs, for they frustrate national educational goals, cause a huge waste in tax dollars, and produce a steady flow of persons marked for economic and social dependency."" 
[In the previous paragraph, ""which is the subject of this hearing"" is circled.]
It seems to me that students, although they are the group most directly and profoundly affected by desegregation, have, with a few notable exceptions, been excluded from planning, implementing, monitoring and improving school desegregation programs. Among the many excellent recommendations Hall made in his testimony, which incidentally are reflected in current juvenile justice legislation, let me emphasize his recommendation ""to provide a formal and meaningful role for students
14
in planning and executing desegregation programs as well as programs ensuring juvenile justice and preventing juvenile delinquency."" 
[The previous paragraph is circled.]
When Black child development is viewed in the context of economics, we perceive that we are involved in a struggle for economic justice in a system that has barely afforded us economic survival. With our history of oppression and the current and past climate of repression aimed at us; with the might of government aimed at protecting the power of the few who have, against the many who have not; with the official economic policy of the United States Socialism and welfare millionarism for the wealthy and Capitalism and free enterprise for the poor; then it is obvious that the present system simply cannot and will not guarantee an equal distribution of goods and services for Black children and their parents. 
The economic crisis we currently suffer is taking its greatest toll on those least able to bear the burdens. The Black community bears a disproportionately large amount of that burden.
15  
According to an article by Andrew Brimmer in this month's Black Enterprise, ""Business in general, and Black-owned businesses in particular, will have a rocky road to travel over the remainder of this year and well into 1976."" Brimmer says this will be due in large part to the announced policies of the federal government, which is basically committed to checking inflation by allowing only moderate expansion during the rest of this decade. 
[The previous paragraph is circled.]
As the economy continues to grind down upon itself, the numbers of jobs shrinks, and the numbers of workers without jobs begins to rise. Given this general picture, the situation for Black workers is especially precarious. In April, the unemployment rate for Blacks was 14.6 percent, compared with 8.1 percent for whites. And what about the most immediate concern of this audience, the Black youth? 
According to the latest figures put out by the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, and these are May unemployment figures, and do not reflect those leaving school in June, the unemployment rate for
16 
Black youths between the ages of 16 and 19 is forty percent, slightly more than twice that of their white counterparts. 
James P. Comer, in a recent New York Times article discusses the effect of unemployment on parent and child relationships. He writes, ""Our most accepted principles of child development tell us that preparation for adulthood does not begin with the 18-year-old, then ten-year-old, not even entirely with the infant. It begins with the parents, their hopes, plans, sense of belonging in the community and society, their sense of personal adequacy and specific childbearing skills. 
""Nothing speaks louder to their sense of belonging and adequacy, nothing shapes their hopes and dreams and plans, and nothing enables them to exercises their child-rearing skills more than the ability to find and hold a job and meet the major responsibility that society charges them with: that of taking care of their families."" 
As if the current unemployment picture isn't bad enough, it is generally agreed that the longer-run policies being pursued by the Ford
17
Administration will keep the level of unemployment high through the remainder of this decade. 
We must re-evaluate our concepts of industrial policies as they affect employment practices. If total employment fails, the work week must be cut for all industries, even those who do have full employment, in order that no workers shall be unemployed. If this action requires government wage subsidies, or a negative income tax, it can be financed by a capital levy on personal wealth beyond some acceptably high minimum of assets. 
Of course, to think in this direction is to think toward a radical restructuring of our society. It is thinking toward overturning and outlawing practices which, directly or indirectly, deliberately or by oversight, perpetuate those chronic and evil inequalities that have kept us at the bottom of the economic barrel. 
I have tried to confine my remarks to the discussion topics relating directly to the legislative process. However, if you will 
18
indulge me a little longer, I want to share some of my ideas of those other subjects you will be discussing in the next two days. 
The news media generates the basic information upon which most of us plan our lives. It is therefore necessary that we understand the tremendous power of the media in shaping public opinion, and that we become fully aware of the blatant bias the media in this country has toward those citizens clinging to the lower rungs of the economic ladder. 
Consider, for example, the monopoly press in this city which controls both daily newspapers, the largest television and AM and FM radio stations, and which has just completed a disgraceful series of articles in one of its newspapers designed to illuminate the ""welfare mess."" But the real illumination intended by the monopoly press is to reinforce commonly held views that welfare recipients are lazy, promiscuous, ignorant cheats. 
As the social service role of the church has diminished and as state sponsored social service organizations have failed, a number of community organizations have been spawned to fill the gap. Unfortunately, 
19
they are usually under-financed and under-staffed, but they should not be underestimated as effective prods towards effective public action. 
In the past ten years, educated, community-oriented young policemen and policewomen have worked to improve the relationship between some police and some Black people. The Afro-American Patrolmen's Association and the Guardians have helped close a wide credibility gap between protectors and victims. All too often, however, the man in blue forgets that he was ever Black and, by attempting to be a ""book"" policemen, he imitates the worst excesses of his white counterpart. 
The same, unfortunately, is true in my profession. Scandals involving Black faces in high places are not entirely due to racist District Attorneys or Internal Revenue agents. In our desire to be more American than any other Americans, we too often copy behavior that we would not tolerate in the white elected officials whose places we have taken. The standard excuse that ""white politicians have been doing this for years"" simply will not wash. It's never our turn to lie,
20
to steal, to cheat, to enrich ourselves at public expense.  
And finally, a look at the Black family, probably the most important topic at this conference. I am the father of five children, and I insist, perhaps unrealistically, that my children accept my values, not the values of Super Fly and Shaft. Our families are doomed to failure and separation if we allow our children to seek moral guidance from the silver screen. Our experiences and values, with all our strengths and weaknesses, failures and frustrations, offer loving guidance that will serve our children longer and better than will Shazam and Kung Fu. 
Let me leave you with the words of Dr. W. E. B. DuBois, who, some forty years ago, spelled out the task that lies ahead for educated men and women: 
""Biologically, we are mingled of all conceivable elements, but race is psychology, not biology, and psychologically we are a unified race with one history, one red memory, and one revolt. 
It is not ours to argue whether
21
we will be segregated or whether we ought to be a caste. We are segregated; we are a caste.  
""Our problem is: how far and in what way can we consciously and scientifically guide our future as to insure our physical survival, our spiritual freedom and our social growth? Either we do this or we die. There is no alternative. If America proposed the murder of this group, its moral descent into imbecility and crime, and its utter loss of manhood, self-assertion and courage, the sooner we realize this the better. 
""By that great line of McCay ""If we must die, let it not be like hogs."" But the alternative of not dying like hogs is not that of dying and killing like snarling dogs. It is rather conquering the world by thought and brain and plan; by expression and organized cultural ideals.  
Therefore, let us not beat futile wings in an impotent frenzy, but carefully plan and guide our segregated life, organize in industry and politics to protect it and expand it . . . . 
""What will be, no one knows. It may be great segregation of the world along the color line; it may be an economic rebirth which 
22
which insures spiritual and group integrity amid physical diversity. It may be utter annihilation of class and color barriers in one ultimate mankind, differentiated by talent, susceptibility and gift — but any of these ends are matters of long centuries and not years. 
We live in years, swift, flying, transient years. 
We hold the possible future in our hands but not by wish and will, only by thought, plan, knowledge and organization.

Since the conference workshops during the next two days will concentrated concentrate on every aspect of black child development,
2
I think it would be appropriate for me to comment briefly on such as these topics and explore with you some possible solutions to what I consider the most critical problem facing black Americans - the underdevelopment of our most precious resource - black children.
Lest my remarks be constructed as final pruon prouncements on the various subjects up for discussion, let me hasten to say that I am not foolish enough to try and compete with the panels of experts.
My comments for the most part will be thoughts and opinions, backed up in some cases with statistics, but mostly supported by 35 years of living, lrearan learning and working in a society that rewards some of its young with lavish advantages and punishes others by withholding the basic necessities of life.

Let's begin with the role of the health care community in ensuring the survival of black children and youth. We already know that poverty, rural residence, environmental conditions and race are powerful barriers to good health.
Let's begin with health care and the development of black children and youth. We already know that poverty, rural residence, environmental ] 3 conditions and race are powerfi powerful barriers to good health. In 1969, 4 million black children lived in poverty. These children continue to suffer from higher rates of infant mortality with more chronic sickness and disease experienced during childhood than whites. According to 1971 health statistics complied by the Southern Regional Council, if black infant mortality rates in 1971 the South for 1971 had been equal to white infant deaths, 3,408 black babies would have survived the first year of life. Black children ages 1-4 die at a higher rate from accidents, congenital malformations, flux and pneumonia, meon meningitis and from other causes. In a national nutrition survey conducted in 1972 several years ago by the Department of Health Education and Welfare According to the American Academy of Pediatrics' analysis of a
4
17 1972 nutrition survey conducgted by the Department of Health, Education and Welfare, 70 percent of black pre-school children living the the South were anemic. There is evidence to show that iron deficiency of the mild type makes a definite difference in how individuals perform.
The nation's health care system makes no attempt to deal with the full range of factors that affect an individual's health. The barriers I have already pointed out--poverty, rural residence, race, poor environment--plus the lack of needed manpower and facilities--are considered beyond the province of the fee-for-service practitioner. Most federal health programs tend to be dominated by provider rather than consumer interests and are little more than half-hearted assaults on a complex, fragmented system.
Notable exceptions to this rule have been the federally supported comprehensive health care centers which stress, in addition to primary health care, such equally important considerations as preventive care, emphasizing outreach, family counseling, food programs and reducing environmentally-related health hazards.
5
I am also disturbed by some of the proposals for a national health insurance scheme which seem resigned to simply puring pouring more money into the present malfunctioning system and hoping this money will trickle down in the form of increased benefits for consumers.
There is one national health plan that differs b substantially from the rest. That is the one that has been introduced by the U.S. Representative Ron Dellums and endorsed by the Congressional Black Caucus. Six principles from his proposed legislation that have paramount importance are:

Complete, accessible community based health care for all with no charge for services;
Financing through fully progressive taxes;
Elimination of profit making;
No restrictions on eligibility on benefits;
Control and review of quality by the health professionals as well as community review, and
Strict control over quality price and distribution of all drugs.

No more basic reform is needed than that the health care system devote its energies solely to implementing the right of
6
decent health care for all. Reform of this nature can not, will not and should not come from within the present health establishment. If health care is truly to be a right, the interests of the consumer must be overriding in the system, and haeealth care institutions must be structured to respoi respond to those interests.
With regard to social services and black child development, I firmly believe that these should be provided for by the state. In fact, this very conference is a gross admission that the state has the need for an organization such as the National Council for Black ] 6 Child d Eve Development is a gross an admission that the state has failed an important segment of our society. Recognizing that that there are numerous state responsibilities relating to black child development, let me emphasize one that is a crucial importance of critical importance. - national comprehensive child care legislation. The need for such legil legislation is urgent, especially now as the purchasing power of the dollar declines, as more and more families require assistance- food, health care, subsidized services - to meet the basic survival needs of their children. And as the unemployment rolls grow, particularly with the increase in male
8 7
unemployment, the general sense of economic insecurity may well be forcing more mothers to take part-time jobs, and may be keeping more new mothers in the work force after their children are born.
The federal legislation I envision would provide the framework and the funds for a community to deal with its own most urgent needs - health, nutrition, family support services, outreach, prenatal care, ] 7 day care, preschool education or whatever other particular needs the community has.
The principal objective of such federal legislation must be to provide services to families who want and need them in order to meet the comprehensive needs of their children. Although the lack of quality day care options is one of the most pressing needs in many communities today, this legislation must not only a day care bill. xx Even though education is a component of such a comprehensive, the legislation must not be an early childho childhood education bill. It must support families. And since child care needs differ from family to family and from community to community, the community itself must be able to assess its overall child care needs, to make local choices about the types of services to be offered, and to
 9 8
determine who within the community should provide those services so that families have options.

Give parents the cror central role in the community's decisions about the types of services to be provided and in the day-to-day operation of the programs in which their children are
10 9
	participating.
Allow enough flexibility to prof provide parents and families with real options, including services in a variety of settings. For example, in-the-home, in neighborhood facilities, places of employment.
Preserve existing community child care institutions, including head start projects, and assure opportunity for such institutions to ] 9 expand and to receive funds under this legislation.
Encourage services in settings that support the family and are relevant to the child's own community, including [illegible] parents.
Include a funded mechanism for enforcing federal standards.
Provide a mechanism for coordination with other agencies providing services for children in the community - including those provided through public health, education, and welfare agencies and especially those provided with Title XX and Head Start funds.

11 10
In addition to these objectives when considering delivery of for the services, I would like want to mention two systems of delivery under special consideration which I oppose.
First, a new campaign is underway to place the entire delivery system in the public school system. I am against giving schools the responsibility for a new comprehensive program when they are far from meeting the responsibilities they already have. ] 10
Second, I am concerned about the role of profit-makers in any proposed legislation. Therefer Therefore, I believe that public funds to support franchised, commercial child care operations should be specifically excluded.
Ll Limiting the program to public and private, non-profit agencies would not exclude employer-provided child care, nor should it eliminate family day care operators, if properly written.
In addition to the need for comprehensive child development legislation at the federal level, pressure must be brought to bear on local and state levels of government as well.
As far as state government is concerned, three of the South only three states in the South Southern region have committed state monies for day
11
care. They are Florida, South Carolina, and Tennessee. I undert understand that a number of Southern states are turning baft Title back Title 4 A money that could be matched by state money for the support of day care centers.
In my own state of Georgia, the Department of Human Resources has put up some monies to be matched with local and federal funds fro da for day ] 11 care and I am very hopeful that this amount can be increased in the 1976 budget. Be assured that I will do everything I can to see that this is accomplished. Also keep in mind that nearly 60 percent of revenue sharing funds spent by state governments goes for education., There is no reason why a portion of that should not go for developmental day care.
And one last note on day care legislation. State Represen It has jest been brought to my attention that state State Rep. Arie Taylor of Colorado has introduced a child care bill in the Colorado State Legislature, Her bill would which would create an Office of Early Childhood Programs in the Colorado Department of Social Services.
12 13 12
I am interested in I want to finding out learning more about her proposed legislation and whether it might be appropriate for my state.
I am Concerninged about the role of public education with regard to as it affects black children's development, it ought to be obvious to any observer that for I believe that American public education is increasingly failing to prepare its graduates to cope with the most elemental of elementary daily activities: - the ability skills to fill out an employment form, to keep the house-hold household budget or balance a chechboo checkbook - not to mention reading, writingand adding. --and especially in these times -- subtracting.
In addition to the schools' failure to educate, we are finding more and more evidence to support to the charge by the Southern Regional Council's School Desegregation Project that racial discrimination in and arbitrary actions of school suthorities authorities in desegregated Southern schools is are resulting is a in a phonomenon phenone phenomenon known as ""the student pushout."" problem
Leon Hall, director of the School Desegregation Project, defines the pushout as a student who has been expelled or suspended from school under questionable circumstances or who,
14 13
because of intolerable hosit hostility directed against him or her, finally quita school quits school.
In testimony prepared pr presented last May before the House Subcommittee on ] 13 Equal Opportunities, Hall said, ""In human terms, pushouts caused by discrimination result in large numbers of young people who lose hope and are marked by despair and bitterness. Often they graduate into the worlds of drugs, unemployment and welfare, contributing to the delinquency problem which is the subject of this hearing. Syn Systems which produce large numbers of such persons are indefensible. As well, they produce great social costs, for they frustrate national educational goals, cause a huge waste in tax dollars, and produce a steady flow of persons marked for economic and social dependency.""
Hall's testimony is rel reflected in current legislation pertaining to jeveile justice.
It seems to me that those most directly and most profoundly affected by desegregation -- students -- have, with a few salutary exceptions, been excluded from planning, implementing, monitoring and improving school desegregation programs. Among the many excellent
13 14
recommendations Hall made in his testimony - which incadentally incidentally is reflected in current juvenile justice legislation pertaining to juvenile justice - let me emphasize his recommendation ""to provide a formal and meaningful role for students"" ] 14 in planning and executing desegregation proas programs as well as programs ensuring juvenile justice and preventing juvenile delinquency.""
When econa economics and child [illegible] are black child development are discussed, it ought to be obvious that any system like such as ours which provides welfare and socialism for the wealthy and capitalism for the poor, simply cannot and will not guarantee an equal distribution of goods and services for children or their parents black children or their parents.
When economics and black child development are discussed, is viewed in the context of economics, it ought to be obvious that we are involved in a struggle for economic justice in a system that has barely afforded us economic survival. With our history of oppression and the cr current and past climate of repression aimed at us, with the might of government aimed at protecting the power of the few who have, against the many who have not, with the official economic policy of the United States
16 15
Socialism and welfare millionarism for the wealthy and Capitalism and free enterprise for the poor, it is no wonder that econimic development stands high on our list of priorities obvious that the present system simply cannot and will not guarantee an equal distribution of goods and services for black children and their parents.
There is no doubt that the current economic crisis is taking its greatest toll on those least able to bear the burdens and the balck business black  community is no exception to that rule.
] 15 According to an article by Andrew Brimmer in this month's Black Enterprise, ""Business in general, and black-owned businesses in particular, will have a rocky road to travel over the remainder of this year and well into 1976."" This will be doe due in large part, Brimmer goes on to say, to the announced policies of the federal government, which is basically committed to checking inflation by allowing only moderate expansion during the rest of this decade.
As the economy continues to grind down upon itself, the numbers of jobs shrinks, and the numbers of workers without jobs begins to rise. Given this general picture, the situation for black workers is particularly precarious. On In April, the unemployment
17 16
rate for blacks was 14.6 percent, compared with 8.1 percent for whites. And what about the most immediate concerns of this audience -- the black teenager youth? According to the latest figures put out by the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics -- and these are May figures unemployment figures, and do not rel reflect those leaving school in June -- the unemployment rate for ] 16 black youths between the ages of 16 and 19 is 40 percent, slightly more than twice [illegible] that of their white counterparts.
In a recent, New y\York Times article by James P. Comer James P. Comer, in a recent New York Times article discusses the effect of unemployment on parent and child relationships. He writes, ""Our most accepted principles of child development tell us that preparation for adulthood does not begin with the 18-year-old, the 10-year-old, not even entirely with the infant. It begins with the parents, their hopes, plans, sense of belonging in the community and society, their sense of personal adequacy and specific child- rearing skills.
""Nothing speaks louder to their sense of belonging and adequacy,
[A handwritten note is crossed out on verso of page 16.] 
18 17
nothing shapes their hopes and dreams and plans, ad and nothing enables them to exercise their child-rearing skills more than their ability to find and hold a job and meet the major responsibility that society charges them with - that of taking care of their families.""
As if the current unemployment picture is't bad enough, it is generally agreed that the longer-run policies being pursued by the Ford ] 17 Administration will keep the level of unemployment high through the remainder of this decade.
We must reappraise the whole set of re-evaluate our concepts of industrial relations with respect to as they affect employment practices. If total employment fails, the general work week must be cut for all industries, whether or not some among them have full employment, in order that noe none shall be unemployed. And if this requires government wage subsides, or a negative income tax, this can be financed by a capital levy on personal wealth beyond some acceptably high minimum of assets.
Of course, to think in this direction is to think towards a radical restructuring of the society. and It is towards thinking the outlawing of all practices which, directly or indirectly, deliberately or by oversight, permit continuance of the perpetuate those chronic and evil disequalities which that have placed kept us at the bottom of the barrel of the eco. barrel.
18
I've tried to confine my remarks to the discussion topics relating directly to the legislative process. However, if you will ] 18 indulge me a litle little longer, I would like to share some of my ideas on those other subjects you will be discussing over the next two days.
The news media [form] generates the basic information upon which most of us plan our lives. It is therefore necessary that we understand the pow tremendous power of the media in shaping public opinion and the blatant bias the media in this country has toward those at the bottom. For example, the monopoly press in this city which controls both daily newspapers, the largest TV
20 19
and AM and FM radio stations, has just completed a disgraceful series of articles designed to cater to every stereotypical view of the welfare system - to reeinforce the commonly held view that welfare recipients are lazy, promiscuous, ignorant cheats.
As the social role of the church as has diminished and state sponsored social service organizations have faild failed, a number of community organizations have been spawned to fill the gap. Unfortunately, ] 19 they are usually under financed and under staffed, but should not be underestimated as effective prods toward effective public programs action.
With the As emergence over the past decade of younger, better educated communitie community oriented policemen and women emerged, the relationship between some police and some black people has radically changed for the better. The Afro American Patrolmen's Association and the Guardians have helped close a wide crd credibility gap betw between the protectors and victims. All too often, however, the man in blue forgets that he was ever black and attempts to be a by attempting to be a ""book"" policeman, he emitates imitates
21 20
the worst excesses of his white counterpart.
The same is unfortunately true in my profession. The same scoundrals scandals involving black faces in high places is not entirely due to racist district attorneys or internal revenue agents. In our desire to be more American than any other Americans, we too frequently copy behavior that we would not tolerate in the white elected officials in the whose places we have taken. The standard excuse that ""white politicians have been doing this for years"" simply will not wash. It's never our turn to lie, ] 20 to steal, to cheat, to enrich ourselves at public expense.
And finally, a look at the black family, probably the most important topic at this conference. As I am the father of five children, I and I insist, perhaps unrealisticlly, that my children accept my values and not the values of super fly and Super Fly and Shaft. Families are doomed if to failure if. Our families our are doomed to failure if our children are allowed to  seek moral guidance from the silver screen.
Let me leave you with
21
Let me leave you with the words of Dr. W. E. B. Dubois, speaking 41 years ago who who, some 40 years ago, spelled out the task that lay ahead for educated men and women such as yourselves:
[The following paragraph is handwritten on this page but intended for insertion on the previous page:]

[The final four pages switch to handwriting on yellow lined paper, and provide the W. E. B. DuBois quote referenced on the previous page.]
Dr Dubois speaking 41 years ago, spelled out the task that lay ahead for educated men and women like you.
""Biologically we are mingled of all conceivable elements, but race is psychology, not biology, and sp psychologically we are a unified race with one history, one red memory, and one revolt.
It is not ours to argue whether we will be segregated or whether ] 21 we ought to be a caste. We are segregated; we are a caste.
Our problem is: how far and in what way can we consciously and scientifically guide our future so as to insure our physical survival, our spiritual freedom and our social growth? Either we do this or we die. There is no alternative. If America proposed the murder of this group, its moral descent into imbecility and crime and its utter loss of manhood, self assertion and courage, the sooner we realize this the better.
4
By that great line of McCay ""If we must die, let it not be like hogs"" But the alternative of not dying like hogs is not that of dying and killing like snarling dogs. It is rather conquering the world by thought and brain and plan; by expression and organized cultural ideals.
Therefore, let us not beat futile wings in impotent frenzy, but carefully plan and guide our segregated life, organize in industry and politics to protect it and expand it.....
What will be, no one knows. It may be a great segregation of the world along the color line, it may be an economic rebirth which insures spiritual and group integrity amid physical diversity. It may be utter annihilation of class and color barriers in one ultimate mankind, differentiated by talent, susceptibility and gift - but any of these ends are

We live in years, swift, flying, transient years.
We hold the possible future in our hands but not by wish and will, only by thought, plan, knowledge and organization."

Julian Bond
March - 1975 -
Copyright 1975
We are gathered here at an auspicious moment in history, - exactly ten years ago tonight, the historic march from Selma to Montgomery began, the march that set in motion the 1965 Voting Rights [the following seems to be intended as a deletion based on the faintly drawn crossout in the manuscript.], that is responsible for many of your being where you are. You additionally know that the 1965 Act will expire in August of this year unless we are successful in renewing it, and you must also know that great difference now exist among its supporters.
There are those who want a simple extension of the existing act, with its coverage of the seven Southern states and a few counties in states outside this region. But there are also those like myself who will insist that the protection under which we have increased the number of Black-elected officials in this region from less than 75 ten years ago to nearly 1,500 today be extended to Black and brown people all across the United States.
2
To illustrate just what we've accomplished, let me quote at length from testimony offered on Monday to the House Judiciary Committee by John Lewis, Executive Director of the Voter Education Project: Mr Lewis said then:
""In 1962, there was not a single Black member of any state legislature in the South. Today, there are 95 blacks in Southern legislatures, with Black representatives in every state and Black state senators in 8 of the 11 states.
The increase of Black participation has brought the dawning of a new day for Southern politics. Many white officials in this region owe their positions as governors, state legislators, mayors, and other offices to the recently-registered Black electorate. Demagogues of the past are now trying to acquire a new public image because they recognize the potential of the minority vote.
3
It is clear that the Voting Rights Act and efforts to increase minority political participation have had a measure of success, but there remains, in 1975, perhaps a greater need than ever to insure permanent protection of minority voting rights.
Black voter registration is up from 1965, but there are still more than two and one-half million Blacks yet unregistered in the 11 Southern states.
It sounds good to cite the 1,587 offices held by Blacks in the South, but we have to note that there are more than 79,000 public offices in the South and the seats held by Blacks represent less than 2 percent of the total.
Blacks hold a majority of seats in the county governments of only six of the South's 101 counties with a majority-Black population.
There are 362 majority Black towns and cities in the South which have not yet elected even the first Black official.
4
While overt forms of intimidation and abuse have - declined, the VEP experience has been that many registration officials serving before the Voting Rights Act still retain their positions. Discourteous and hostile registrars often - contribute to the frustration of Blacks attempting to register to vote. Throughout the South, race continues to be a primary factor in the consideration of appointments to registration - positions and boards.
In many areas of the rural South, including the non-covered states of Tennessee, Florida, Arkansas and Texas, there is still an element of fear on the part of Blacks and a threat of economic reprisal against those who might register to vote for the first time. Among the fears known to VEP are loss of jobs and income, eviction, refusal of credit, loan foreclosures, and denial of social security, welfare payments, and food stamps.
5
Many mechanisms plague the minority electorate and have the intent and effect of diluting the Black vote in the South. The use of at-large elections almost uniformly deters Black representation in public offices, especially at the city and county level of government throughout the Southern states.
In addition to such practices which have existed since the period prior to passage of the act, those who would devise new barriers to Black participation in Southern politics are hard at work gerrymandering, annexing, consolidating, changing polling places, changing election methods -- in short, using every conceivable tactic to oppose, circumvent, or ignore the intent of the Voting Rights Act.
Gerrymandering has occurred in recent years, ranging from congressional boundaries to city council districts. The state legislatures of South Carolina, Mississippi, Georgia, Louisiana,
6
Alabama, and Virginia have all formulated reapportionment plans which have been challenged and found to be discriminatory to the Black vote.
The records of the Justice Department reveal case after case of attempts to hinder, dilute, and eliminate the power of the minority vote. These violations of section 5 of the Voting Rights Act did not occur a decade ago. They happened last year, last month, yesterday, and there is no indication that they will cease in the foreseeable future. Those who hold illegitimate power will not give it up voluntarily. As Frederick Douglass stated in 1857, ""Power concedes nothing without a struggle, it never has and it never will.""
In fact, election law and regulation changes in many areas of the South have not even been submitted to the Justice Department in violation of the Election 5 Preclearance Clause. The abuses of
7
the Voting Rights Act are such that enforcement of Section 5 must be continued and, if possible, increased. There are Southern voices which have claimed embarrassment  because of having to comply with the Voting Rights Act, but the continued violations demonstrate that the embarrassment has not brought about repentance.""1
The Lewis Statement is worth quoting at such great length because it so clearly spells out what great distances we have covered, as well as the great distances yet to go.
He closed his remarks with four recommendations that ought to have special meaning to us all:

A permanent, national act should be passed to guarantee permanent minority voting rights protection:
8

The permanent voting rights protection for minorities should include a ban on literacy requirements for registration, and should exclude all other requirements except age, citizenship, and residence:
The Department of Justice should be given greater enforcement powers to secure compliance with provisions of a permanent act, and
There should be a greater federal presence in areas where minority voting rights are threatened.

John Lewis' recommendations are simple and direct. If enacted, they will extend to minorities across this country the rights and protections we here struggled for over years of disappointment and difficulty.
That national protection is needed is self evident; millions of Black and brown people, North, West, and South, find themselves
9
still powerless because they are deliberately excluded from the political process.
In our section of the country, it was done by white-sheeted cowards riding at night, the midnight bomb or the test that Albert Einstein could not pass; in the rest of the country, exclusion is more subtle but just as pervasive. In big city after big city, north of the Mason-Dixon line and west of the Mississippi, political machines and official hostility have combined to keep us unregistered and unlistened to.
It is not without accident that there are proportionately more Black people registered to vote now in Selma, Alabama, than there are in Brooklyn, New York.
[The hand-drawn lines here and following may indicate either an emphasis or a pause.]
__________________
__________________
Many of you are mayors of towns and cities deliberately made small by the hostile forces of yesteryear, that drove Black people north to what they thought was political and economic
10
freedom; instead, many entered into a kind of continual slavery based on low wages and servitude to political machines. They will have a chance to duplicate your successes in the cities where they live now if we are able to let them share in the protections now given to us.
__________________
As you watch--and hopefully, participate in--the struggle to extend voting rights to all, let me hope that you can continue heightening your own power. As mayors, you have duties and responsibilities outlined in your city's charter, defined, perhaps, by the state legislature; limited, perhaps, by a hostile city council or county governing body.
But as Black men and women who have demonstrated that you have leadership abilities, and that others will follow your lead, you have responsibilities greater than those spelled out by law or limited by men.
11
You have the responsibility to use your prestige, your power of persuasion and your power of retribution to demand greater performance by those who serve above you, a quick look at Black mayors in Alabama, Arkansas, Florida, Georgia, Mississippi, Louisians, North and South Carolina, shows that 33 of you are mayors of cities whose population is 25% or more Black.
Yet only 3 of the 31 congressmen from these districts voted with the rather moderate aims of the Congressional Black Caucus more than 50% of the time, and one of these was Black.
The congressman who represents your chairman, Mayor Cooper, voted with the Black population in his district. He voted against the Emergency Farm Loan Program, against the Public Works and Economic Development Act, against an attempt to override presidential veto of a bill
12
granting water and sewer grants to rural communities, against the Emergency Employment Act, against permitting urban areas to use $700 million dollars for mass transit projects, against emergency medical services, against overridding a presidential veto of an increase in minimum wages. His name is W. Jack Edwards, and lest you think I single him out, the records of some others are no better.
Mayor Clyde Foster of Madison, Alabama, is represented by William l. Dickinson, who opposed the Black Caucus 93% of the time.
Mayor Johnny Ford in Tuskegee, and Mayor Judge Stringer in Hobson City are represented by Bill Nichols, who supported the caucus 27% of the time. Mayor Richard Lewis of Brighton and Mayor Freddie Rogers of Roosevelt City are represented by John Buchanan, who supported the caucus 24% of the time. Not surprisingly, Mayor A. M. Hayden of Uniontown, who lives in a
13
congressional district that is 37% Black, has a congressman, Walter Flowers, who voted with the caucus 37% of the time.
In Arkansas, Mayor Lonnie Webster of Reed and Mayor Arthur Bowens of Mitchellville and Mayor Dave Brooks of Allport are lucky to be represented by Ray Thornton, who voted with the Black caucus 71% of the time, and in Georgia, Mayor Maynard Jackson of Atlanta is lucky to be represented by Andrew Young, who voted with his caucus colleagues 98% of the time. Georgia's only other Black mayor, Richmond Hill of Greenville, is represented by Jack Brinkley, whose district is 32% Black, and who supported the caucus only 27% of the time.
In Florida, Mayor Gus Richardson of Gretna is represented by one of the few congressmen in this survey whose caucus support exceeded the Black population of his district--Don Fuqua, who supported the caucus 37% of the time.
14
Here in Louisiana, Mayor Harry Mims of East Hodge and Mayor Roosevelt Toussaint of Natches and our host, Mayor B. T. Woodward of Grambling, are represented by Otto Passman, who voted with the caucus 39% of the time.
Mayor John Bobb of Grand Coteau is represented by Gillis Long, who voted with the caucus a surprising 78% of the time.
In Mississippi, Mayor N. B. Brooks of Falcon and Mayor James Shanks of Jonestown are represented by James Whitten, who supported the caucus 27% of the time. Mississippi Mayors F. C. Benson of Winstonville, Robert le Flore of Pace and Earl Lucas of Mount Bayou are represented by David Bowen, who voted with the caucus 32% of the time, and Mayors Charles Evers of Fayette and Benny Thompson of Bolton are represented by Thad Cochran, whose district is 43.1% Black but who supported the caucus only 2% of the time.
In North Carolina, Mayor James Boone of Cofield and Edward Jennette of Mesic are represented by Walter Jones, who opposed the
15
caucus 71% of the time. Mayor S. E. Bridges of Princeville is represented by l. H. Fountain, whose district is 40% Black, supported the caucus position only 22% of the time.
Incidentally, one of your number, Mayor Howard Lee of Chapel Hill is also represented by Fountain and almost got a chance to represent him; Mayor Lee received 41% of the vote against Fountain in the Democratic primary in 1972.
Mayor Sidney Bowen of Bolton, North Carolina, is represented by Charles Rose, whose district is 25% Black and who supported the caucus 49% of the time.
Finally, South Carolina Mayors Ralph Campbell of Gifford and Charles Ross of Lincolnville are represented by Mendel Davis, whose district is 22% Black but who supported the caucus 41% of the time; and Mayor Lewis Scott of Eastover and Mayor Silas Seabrook of Santee are represented by Floyd Spence, who supported
16
the caucus position only 2% of the time. Mayor Milliard Rucker of Atlantic Beach and Mayor Carlie Bell Wilson of Sellers used to be represented by Edward Young, whose district was 42% Black but who opposed the caucus 88% of the time.
Before a storm of protest arises, let me say that my figures are two years old. For some of you, circumstances and congressmen may have changed, but in most cases I think my statistics will hold, whether the names are changed or not.
This point I make is a simple one--Black power grows each year in municipal and state legislative posts, but ever so slowly on the federal level.
I won't suggest for a moment that you can immediately defeat the men whose names and sorry records I have just listed, but I do suggest that you can begin now to straighten them out a bit.
17
Suggest to them, if you will, that each must seek re-election next year, and that you will monitor their performance from now until then.
Warn them, if you will, that their votes in Washington will affect how you vote at home, and will determine whether you'll help send them back again.
18
The Congressional Black Caucus promises this year to increase its attention to legislative goals, and hopefully will be able to coordinate your efforts and mine to bring real political pressure on the men and women who set national policy for us in Washington.
You have a rather large task before you. You must try to re-vitalize cities held hostage by hostile state and federal governments while you try to set political goals and directions for your constituents.
Whether the issue is extension of the Voting Rights Act, health care and income security for all, or a new plant and jobs for your city, what affects one of you affects us all. While some of you seek assistance on foreign shores, remember that there are powerful and vindictive forces here opposed to any dialoge between you and the OPEC states, and remember too, that your brothers in Sub-Saharan Africa have discovered that friendship with one side in the struggle in the Middle East does not always bring rewards. We together face formidable odds.
19
We are common victims of a national coalition of the comfortable, the callous and the smug, who've closed their hearts, their minds, and their ranks to the claims and calls to the conscience put forward by the forgotten and unrepresented elements in American society.
We have a job to do, and a world to win. The future is in your hands.2

Remarks Prepared for the Southern Conference of Black Mayors,
Grambling, Louisiana
March 7, 1975
copyright by Julian Bond, 1975
We all know that we are gathered here at an auspicious moment in history, Exactly ten years ago tonight, the historic March from Selma to Montgomery began, the march that set in motion the 1965 Voting Rights that is responsible for many of your being where you are.
You additionally know that the 1965 Act will expire in August of this year unless a substantial we are successful in renewing it, and you must also know that great differences now exist among its supporters.
There are those who want simple extension of the existing act, with its coverage of the [illegible] seven southern states and few counties in states outside this region.
But there are also those like myself who will insist that the protection under which we have increased the number of Black elected officials in this region from less than 75 ten years ago to nearly 1,500 today be extended to Black and Brown people all across the United States. /2
To illustrate just what we've accomplished, let me quote a length from testimony offered on Monday to the House Judiciary Committee by John Lewis, Executive Director of the Voter Education Project:
Mr. Lewis said then:
to extend the franchise to oppressed minorities. Justice Department enforcement has been effective to a point, but even greater gains could have been realized with a stronger federal commitment to enforcement of the Act.
Each year brings another measure of progress: While fewer than 100 blacks held office in the South in 1965, a total of 101 blacks was elected in Georgia alone last year. Of the 11 southern states, only three -- Florida, Tennessee, and Virginia -- have fewer than 100 black public officials in 1975.
When VEP was created ""in 1962, there was not a single black member of any state legislature in the South. Today, there are 95 blacks in southern legislatures, with black representatives in every state and black state senators in 8 of the 11 states.
It has been demonstrated that minority political participation can transform local politics in the South. This lesson is illustrated in places like Greene County, Alabama, where black and white people wave and smile when the Sheriff's car passes them on the highway. This sheriff is a black man, and the phrase ""law and order"" has taken on a new meaning. Even in areas where blacks are not a majority of the population, the sophisticated use of the ballot has potential as a weapon for change for organized minority voters.
The increase of black participation has brought the dawning of a new day for southern politics. Many white officials in this region owe their positions as governors, state legislators, mayors, and other offices to the recently-registered black electorate. Demagogues of the past are now trying hard to acquire a new public image because they recognize the potential of the minority vote. /p3
It is clear that the Voting Rights Act and efforts to increase minority political participation have had a measure of success, but there remains, in 1975, perhaps a greater need than ever to insure permanent protection of minority voting rights.
Black voter registration is up from 1965, but according to the best estimates of the Voter Education Project, there are still more than two and one-half million blacks yet unregistered in the 11 southern states. Based on these four states which maintain voter registration figures by race, VEP estimates that black voter registration in the 11 southern states lags about 15 percentage points behind the rate of white registration. In many rural areas of any given state, the disparity may be far greater.
It sounds good to cite in 1,587 offices held by blacks in the South, but we have to note that there are more than 79,000 public offices in the South and the seats held by blacks represent less than 2 percent of the total.
Blacks hold a majority of seats in the county governments of only six of the South's 101 counties with a majority-black population.
There are 362 majority black towns and cities in the South which have not yet elected even the first black public official. /p4
In the southern states covered by provisions of the Voting Rights Act and in the South as a whole, we still have far to go before full minority political participation is a reality.
While overt forms of intimidation and abuse have declined, the VEP experience has been that many registration officials serving before the Voting Rights Act still retain their positions. Discourteous and hostile registrars often contribute to the frustration of blacks attempting to register to vote. Throughout the South, race continues to be a primary factor in the consideration of appointments to registration positions and boards.
In many areas of the rural South, including the non-covered states of Tennessee, Florida, Arkansas and Texas, there is still an element of fear on the part of blacks and a threat of economic reprisal against those who might register to vote for the first time. Among the fears known to VEP are loss of jobs and income, eviction, refusal of credit, loan foreclosures, and denial of social security, welfare payments, and food stamps.
Many mechanisms plague the minority electorate and have the intent and effect of diluting the black vote in the South. The use of at-large elections almost uniformly deters black representation in public offices, especially at the city and county level of government throughout the southern states.
[A new typeset begins at this page break, and the first paragraph is not transcribed because it is a duplicate of the previous paragraph.]
In addition to such practices which have existed since the period prior to passage of the Act, those who would devise new barriers to black participation in southern politics are hard at work gerrymandering, annexing, consolidating, changing polling places, changing election methods -- in short, using every conceivable tactic to oppose, circumvent, or ignore the intent of the Voting Rights Act.
Gerrymandering has occurred in recent years, ranging from Congressional boundaries to city council districts. The state legislatures of South Carolina, Mississippi, Georgia, Louisiana, Alabama, p6 and Virginia have all formulated reapportionment plans which have been challenged and found to be discriminatory to the black vote.
[A new typeset begins at this page break, and the first and second paragraphs are not transcribed because they are duplicates of the previous two paragraphs.]
The records of the Justice Department reveal case after case of attempts to hinder, dilute, and eliminate the power of the minority vote. These violations of Section 5 of the Voting Rights Act did not occur a decade ago. They happened last year, last month, yesterday, and there is no indication that they will cease in the foreseeable future. Those who hold illegitimate power will not give it up voluntarily. As Fredrick Douglas stated in 1857, ""Power concedes nothing without a struggle; it never has and it never will.""
In fact, election law and regulation changes in many areas of the South have not even been submitted to the Justice Department in violation of the Section 5 preclearance clause. The abuses of /p.7 the Voting Rights Act are such that enforcement of Section 5 must be continued and, if possible, increased. There are southern voices which have claimed embarrassment because of having to comply with the Voting Rights Act, but the continued violations demonstrate that the embarrassment has not brought about repentance.""1
At present, minorities face voting barriers ranging from registration through the actual election process. The barriers include inconvient registration office locations, lack of deputy registrars, burdensome registration forms, inadequate reistration
[A new typeset begins at this page break.]
The Lewis statement is worth quoting at such great length because it so clearly spells out what great distances we have covered, as well as the great distances yet to go.
He closed his remarks with four recommendations that ought to have special meaning to us all:

a permanent, national act should be passed to guarantee permanent minority voting rights protection; /p.8
the permanent voting rights protection for minorities should include a ban on literacy requirements for registration, and should exclude all other requirements except age, citizenship, and residence;
the Department of Justice should be given greater enforcement powers to secure compliance with provisions of a permanent act, and
there should be a greater federal presence in areas where minority voting rights are threatened..

John Lewis' reccomendations are simple and direct. If enacted, they will extend to minorities across this country to the rights and protections we here struggled for over years of dissapointment and difficulty.
That national protection is needed is self evident; millions of Black and Brown people, North, West and South, find themselves /p.9 still powerless because they are deliberately excluded from the political process.
In our section of the country, it was done by the white sheeted cowards riding at night, the midnight bomb or the test that Albert Eienstein could not pass; in the rest of the country, exclusion is more subtle but just as pervasive. In big city after big city, North of the Mason - Dixon line and West of the Mississippi, political machines and official hostility have combined to keep us unregistered and unlistened to.
It is not without accident that there are proportionately more Black people registered to vote now in Selma, Alabama, than there are in Brooklyn, New York.
Many of you are Mayors of towns and cities deliberately made small by the hostile forces of yesteryear, that drove Black people North to what they thought was political and economic /p.10 freedom; instead, many entered into a kind of continual slavery based on low wages and [contain] servitude to political machines. They will have a chance to duplicate your successes in the cities where they live now if we are able to let them share in the protections now given us.
As you watch - and hopefully, participate in - the struggle to extend voting rights to all, let me hope that you can continue heightening your own pawr power.
As Mayors, you have duties and responsibilities outlined in your city's charter, defined, perhaps by the state legislature, limited, perhaps, by a hostile city legislature council or county governing body.
But as Black men and women who have demonstrated that you have leadership abilities, and that others will follow your lead, you have responsibilities greater than those spelled out by law or limited by men. /p.11
You have the responsibility to use your prestige, your power of persuasion and your power of retribution to demand greater performance by those who serve above you.
A quick look at the Black mayors in Alabama, Arkansas, Florida, Georgia, Mississippi, Louisiana, and North and South Carolina, shows that 33 of you are mayors of cities whose population is in one of the 31 Congressional Districts in those eight states where the Black population is 25% or more Black.
Yet only 3 of the [21] 31 congressmen from these districts voted with the rather moderate aims of the Congressional Black Caucus more than 50% of the time, and one of these was Black.
Your The congressman, who represents your chairman Mayor A. J. Cooper, voted with the Black Caucus only 5% of the time, despite a 32% Black population in his district. He voted against the Emergency Farm Loan Program, against the Public Works and Economic Development Act, against an attempt to overide presidential veto of a bill /p.12 granting Water and Sewer grants to rural communities, against the Emergency Employment Act, against permitting urban areas to use $700 million dollars for mass transit projects, against Emergency Medical Services, against overiding a Presidential veto of an increase in minimum wages.
His name is W. Jack Edwards, and less you think I single him out, the records of some others are no better.
Mayor Clyde Foster of Madison, Alabama, is represented by William L. Dickinson, who opposed the Black Caucus 93% of the time.
Mayor Johnny Ford in Tuskegee, and Mayor Judge Stringer in Hobsoh City are represented by Bill Nichols, who supported the Caucus 27% of the time. Mayor Richard Lewis of Brighton and Mayor Freddie Rogers of Roosevelt City are represented by John Buchanan, who supported the Caucus 24% of the time. Not surprisingly, Mayor A. M. Hayden of Uniontown, who lives in a /p.13 Congressional District that is 37% Black, has a congressman, Walter Flowers, who voted with the caucus 37% of the time.
In Arkansas, Mayor Lonnie Webster of Reed and Mayor Arthur Bowens of Mitchellville and Mayor Dave Brooks of Allport are lucky to be represented by Ray Thornton, who voted with the Black Caucus 71% of the time, and in Georgia, Mayor Maynard Jackson of Atlanta is lucky to be represented by Andrew Young, who voted with his Caucus colleagues 98% of the time. Georgia's only other Black Mayor, Richmond Hill of Greenville, is represented by Jack Brinkley, whose district is 32% Black, and who supported the caucus only 27% of the time.
In Florida, Mayor Gus Richardson of Gretna is represented by one of the few Congressmen in this survey whose Caucus support exceeded the Black population of his district - Don Fuqua who supported the Caucus 37% of the time. /p.14
Here in Louisiana, Mayor Harry Mims of East Hodge and Mayor Roosevelt Toussaint of Natchez and our host, Mayor B. T. Woodward of Grambling, [illegible] are represented by Otto Passman, who voted with the caucus 39 per cent of the time. Mayor John Bobb of Grand Coteau [illegible] is represented by Gillis Long, who voted with the Caucus a surprising 78% of the time.
In Mississippi, Mayor N. B. Brooks of Falcon and Mayor James Shanks of Jonestown are represented by Jamie Whitten, who opposed supported the Caucus 27% of the time. Mississippi Mayors F. C. Benson of Winstonville, Robert LeFlore of Pace and Earl Lucas of Mound Bayou are represented by David Bowen, who voted with the caucus 32% of the time, and Mayors Charles Evers of Fayette and Benny Thompson of Bolton are represented by Thad Cochran, whose district in 43.1% Black but who supported the Caucus only 2% of the time.
In North Carolina, Mayor James Boone of Cofield and Edward Jennette of Mesic are represented by Walter Jones, who opposed the /p.15 Caucus 71 per cent of the time. Mayor S. E. Bridges of Princeville is represented by L. H. Fountain, whose district is 40% Black, supported the caucus position only 22% of the time.
Incidentially, one of your number, Mayor Howard Lee of Chapel Hill is also represented by Fountain and almost got a chance to represent him; Mayor Lee received 41% of the vote against Fountain in the Democratic primary in 1972.
Mayor Sidney Bowen of Bolton, North Carolina is represented by Charles Rose, whose district is 25% Black and who supported the caucus half 49% of the time.
Finally, South Carolina Mayors Ralph Campbell of Gifford and Charles Ross of Lincolnville are represented by Mendel Davis, whose district is 22% Black but who supported the caucus 41% of the time, and Mayor Lewis Scott of Eastover and Mayor Silas Seabrook of Santee are represented by Floyd Spence, who supported /p.16 the caucus position only 2 per cent of the time. Mayor Millard Rucker of Atlantic Beach and Mayor Charlie Bell Wilson of Sellers used to be represented by Edward Young, whose district was 42% Black but who opposed the caucus position 88 per cent of the time.
Before a storm of protest arises, let me say that my figures are two years old.2 For some of you, circumstances and congressman may have changed, but in most cases I think my statistics will hold, whether the names are changed or not.
The point I make is a simple one - our Black power grows each year in municipal and state legislative posts, but every so slowly on the federal level.
I won't suggest for a moment that you can immediately defeat the men whose names and sorry records I've just listed, but I do suggest that you can begin now to straighten then out a bit. /p.17
Suggest to them, if you will, that each must seek re-election next year, and that you will monitor their performance from now until then.
Warn them, if you will, that their votes in Washington will affect how you vote at home, and will determine whether what happened to you'll help send them back again.
The Congressional Black Caucus promises this year to increase its attention to legislative goals, and hopefully will be able to coordinate your efforts and mine at reforming to bring real political pressure on the men and women who set national policy for us in Washington.
You have a rather large task before you. You must try to revitalize cities held hostage by hostile state and federal governments, while you next try to set political goals and directions for your constituents., and you [must weigh] the
Whether the issue is extension of the Voting Rights Act, healt care and income security for all, or a new plant for your city, what affects one of you affects us all. While some of you seek assistance on foreign shores, remember that there are powerful and vindictive forces here opposed to any dialoge between you and the OPEC States, and remember too, that your brothers in sub-Saharan africa have discovered that friendship with the one side in the struggle in the Middle East does not always bring rewards.
We together face formidable offs.
We are common victims of a national coalition of the comfortable, the callous and the smug, whove closed their hearts, their monds and their ranks to the cailms and calls to conscience put forward by forgotten and unrepresented elements in American society.
We have a job to do, and a world to win. The future is in your hands.

Finally, South Carolina Mayors Ralph Campbell of Gifford and Charles Ross of Lincolnville are represented by Mendel Davis, whose district is 22% Black but who supported the caucus 41% of the time, and Mayor Lewis Scott of Eastover and Mayor Silas Seabrook of Santee are represented by Floyd Spence, who supported /p.16 the caucus position only 2 per cent of the time. Mayor Millard Rucker of Atlantic Beach and Mayor Charlie Bell Wilson of Sellers used to be represented by Edward Young, whose district was 42% Black but who opposed the caucus position 88 per cent of the time.
Before a storm of protest arises, let me say that my figures are two years old.2 For some of you, circumstances and congressman may have changed, but in most cases I think my statistics will hold, whether the names are changed or not.
The point I make is a simple one - our Black power grows each year in municipal and state legislative posts, but every so slowly on the federal level.
I won't suggest for a moment that you can immediately defeat the men whose names and sorry records I've just listed, but I do suggest that you can begin now to straighten then out a bit. /p.17
Suggest to them, if you will, that each must seek re-election next year, and that you will monitor their performance from now until then.
Warn them, if you will, that their votes in Washington will affect how you vote at home, and will determine whether what happened to you'll help send them back again.
The Congressional Black Caucus promises this year to increase its attention to legislative goals, and hopefully will be able to coordinate your efforts and mine at reforming to bring real political pressure on the men and women who set national policy for us in Washington.
You have a rather large task before you. You must try to revitalize cities held hostage by hostile state and federal governments, while you next try to set political goals and directions for your constituents., and you [must weigh] the
Whether the issue is extension of the Voting Rights Act, healt care and income security for all, or a new plant for your city, what affects one of you affects us all. While some of you seek assistance on foreign shores, remember that there are powerful and vindictive forces here opposed to any dialoge between you and the OPEC States, and remember too, that your brothers in sub-Saharan africa have discovered that friendship with the one side in the struggle in the Middle East does not always bring rewards.
We together face formidable offs.
We are common victims of a national coalition of the comfortable, the callous and the smug, whove closed their hearts, their monds and their ranks to the cailms and calls to conscience put forward by forgotten and unrepresented elements in American society.
We have a job to do, and a world to win. The future is in your hands.

Here is what the Washington Research Project reported in its study, The Shameful Blight: 
""Black voter registration in the seven Southern states specially covered under the Voting Rights Act is still low, both in absolute and in comparative terms. There are many practices in different parts of the South which limit Black registration. 
1. Hours of registration are customarily limited to normal business hours, making it inconvenient for Blacks to register. 
In Leflore County, Mississippi voter registration is possible between 8 a.m. and 5 p.m., Monday through Friday. ""In order for most of the rural people to go to register,"" it was reported, ""it has to be a rainy day because their boss will not let them off work to go and register."" On one occasion six potential registrants were unable to register because "" the registrar stalled for time until time for the office to close."" 
2
2. Registration is usually only possible at the county courthouse, an inconvenient location for many Blacks. 
Black registration in Clay County, Mississippi is limited because registration is only conducted in the county seat, which ""is located in the corner of the county. Many people have to go as many as 30 miles in order to register. As a result, those who do not own cars do not bother to register, also it is rather expensive for those who own cars to make very many trips to town to get people registered."" 
3. The states and counties rarely take action to publicize the need for registration or assume the burden of assuring that residents are registered.
When Jasper County, Mississippi required all voters to reregister it gave no notice of this requirement over the radio, and newspaper publicity, according to the Department of Justice, was inadequate and misleading. 
4. Many Blacks, especially in rural areas, are still afraid to register, often this fear is reasonable, seldom is it counteracted. 
In southwest Georgia ""people are still afraid to register—and with good reason—for fear of economic sanctions or physical sanctions that may 
3
be applied against them if they do."" The Blacks least likely to have registered are ""the people who work in plants and are maids, the day laborers and unskilled workers: in short, those who are the most vulnerable to economic pressures if they register."" 
5. In some jurisdictions public officials have interfered with voter registration drives: in others, private persons have done so. 
The Circuit Clerk in Hymphreys County, Mississippi was completely uncooperative during a voter registration campaign. On one Monday registration workers arrived at his office at 2 p.m., to be told that he had gone to a funeral and would not be back. On Tuesday they came back with other applicants at 9 a.m. ""They were told Mr. Hood (the clerk) was busy. At 9:30 he was allegedly on the phone. At 10:00 he left and said he had to go to a supervisory meeting."" On Wednesday the workers arrived at 4:15 p.m. ""Mr. Hood met them at the door, saying the office was closed."" On Friday they arrived at 1 p.m. they were told that the clerk had gone to his lawyer's office. The local telephone company refused to install a telephone for the voter registration campaign conducted by a Black organization in Calhoun County, Arkansas until a complaint was filed with the state Public Service Commission. 
4
The local bank gave the organization ""considerable runaround"" concerning the opening of an account. 
6. In some jurisdictions a purge of the registration rolls has placed a heavier burden on Blacks than on whites or has been carried out in a manner which discriminates against Blacks. 
Blacks in Hale County, Alabama wanted a purge of the registration rolls because 136 percent of the white population was registered compared to 68 percent of the Black. Ninety percent of the four thousand persons purged in the two-thirds Black county, however, were Black.""  
There can be no doubt that simple justice requires that the 1965 Voting Rights Act be extended for another five years at a minimum, and enforced more vigorously in the future than it has been in the past. 
But a quick review [of] shows that the process that bought the act the to fruition, the agitation that upset a nation and forced a reluctant president, Lyndon Johnson, to go before the Congress could not be ignited again. 
For one, we have lost our standard bearer, the single Black figure who could inspire us to acts of individual and mass courage. 
But [more] as importantly, we seem to have lost our will toward action, toward movement, toward the kind of dedication that 
5
typified the sixties, that made a reluctant Congress move. 
For as we have reaped the benefits of the social activism of the '60s, too many of us have fallen into the sleep of the '70s, lulled into calm by a large number of Black faces in high places. 
We have used the local political process to improve ourselves, and at the same time, lately have become the victims of the process on a national level. 
There ought to be no denying, however, that the ancient art of politics ought to have first priority for the poverty stricken in the 70s. 
That is because it is politics which decides—in the end—what kinds of lives, if any—our children will have, what kind of world we will live in, and what our futures will be. 
It was politics that sent some of our sons to Southeast Asia, to shoot and kill and be killed by other mother's sons they'd never seen: it was politics that brought some back home. 
Politics has wounded some more here than there, making them first in war, last in peace, and seldom in the hearts of their countrymen. 
Politics has decreed that unemployment for Black people will be 2 and 3 times the national average, and politics has decided we'll live in a permanent depression; conversely, it is politics which can guarantee jobs and income for us now. 
6
The political process—at its best—represents a great debate over philosophical principles and definitions of government's role in dissolving conflicts between economic and racial interest groups: at its worst it is tweedledum versus tweedledee, or plays for power between competing political parties. 
The higher debate is seldom clearly heard: it is more often obscured by personality—or lack of it: appeals to patriotism, scare tactics or ordinary obfuscation of the issues. 
The clever observer and student can see through this haze, can see groups forming and falling apart. Such a student probably now sees that the last great contest in this nation was not Republicans against Democrats or Nixon versus McGovern. 
It was instead a victory for a mighty coalition of the comfortable, the callous and the smug, who closed their ranks, their minds and their hearts against the claims and calls to conscience put forward by the forgotten and unrepresented elements in American society. 
This, then, was total triumph for the national nullification of the needs of the needy, the gratuitous gratification of the gross and the greedy, or supreme shinishness and satisfied selfishness.
7 
It climaxed four years of abject surrender in the war on poverty, of a diminuation of civil liberties, of threats to civil rights. 
It promised four more years of five o'clock shadow and half past promises, of broken dreams and busted hopes.  
But suddenly the golden ring came round again.  
Those who wanted four more years now hope for two off with good behavior. Those who publically opposed crime in the streets were caught privately practicing crime in the suites. 
The revolt against the new Reconstruction, the radical reformation of relationships between the governed and the governors began in the late sixties. 
Nearly a decade of agitation and demonstrations preceded the revolt, and but the frenetic activity of the sixties created a political movement characterized by selfishness and fear. Backlash does not adequately describe a population frightened by long hair or terrified by clenched fists: but this massive manipulation of the American mind did make the mundane magnificent, and put government in the hands of men and women who believe in privilege for the powerful and neglect of the powerless. 
As the middle of the 60s rolled by, the situation of Black people became static and the following trends began to emerge:  
—Many of the former fervent supporters of what used tol to be called the civil rights movement began to be diverted by
8 
other, less traumatic concerns. For many, picking up beer cans by the side of the highway became an acceptable substitute to winning jobs for Black people in the brewery. For others, the loveable and peaceful non-violent marchers of the first part of the decade were replaced—if not in fact, then certainly in the public fancy—by the rapacious rioters of the end of the decade. 
Private attention turned away from the public problems of Black and brown poor people. 
The cruel and callous castrators in Washington moved with cold calculation to kill and condense urban renewal, model cities, community action, public service employment, student loans, public housing, personal impact funds for education, and to impose a 60% national pull back in social services. 
Human problems are now placed on a balance sheet and forced to add up: to pay for themselves. The new administrators in Washington run the programs they direct with all the solicitude of a hungry mortician at an old folks home. 
While the nation waltzed into the 70s believing that its Black problem had been blown or burned away: 
—Infant mortality rates forf us remained twice as high as for everyone else: 
—Nearly half of all Black families in the United States earned less than $5,000.00 a year;
9 
—The average Black American was dying seven years earlier than his white counterpart; 
—We remained the last to be hired and the first to be fired.  
While American liberalism was brought into a state of dissaray by its failure to mount successful and sustained campaigns against the continuing war in Southeast Asia, and while the college youth who formerly marched militantly in the streets were discovered running naked through the college grounds—attempting to prove perhaps that all men are not created equal—some weaknesses in our own ranks appeared.  
Many of our young people who were bouyed in the '60s by the beauty in Blackness now seem bowled over by the bougaloo, bid-whist and Boone's Farm. Many apparently believe their politics can be expressed by the length of their hair or the complexity of their handshakes. 
Our community—which has always had its share of charlatans and knaves, now seems overflowing with political pimps of all kinds. They endorse candidates not because they're good but because they'll win: they respect no party or principle, but owe allegiance only to themselves: you cannot engage them in a battle of wits for they are all unarmed men. 
Throughout this depression of mind and soul that has afflicted Black America, the political process, its successes and failures, has held the attention of an increasing number
10 
of Black men and women. 
You We all know of the Tom Bradleys and Maynard Jacksons and Coleman Youngs. You know of Barbara Jordan and Shirley Chisholm. But did you know:
—that the number of Black elected officials in the 11 Southern states has increased by 2000% since 1964?
—that Black people are registered to vote in proportionately larger numbers in Selma, Alabama, than they are in Chicago and New York? 
—that Black women and men in the Southern region have a faith in the political process that reflects neither the naivete of the political [voice] novice nor the cynicism of the jaundiced veteran? 
They are men and women who reject the notion that all politicians are hacks and fools: they believe that politics must mean people and their problems, and not just candidates and elections. 
—They know they face a hard period ahead where help from elsewhere will not come forth as swiftly as it once did.  
Unlike their counterparts in the East and West, they have developed a staying power that follows a continuous line from the middle 1950s to the present; through sit-ins and freedom rides to voter marches, today's Southern Black politics is an unbroken continuum; the political process is the natural end product for a people who see struggle as a continual—and not an occasional process.
11 
As this region of the country produced America's moral leadership, in earlier decades, it continues to produce the political model for today. 
Several themes dominate the thinking of political activists in the Southern region today. 
Foremost Minimal among them is the retention and extension of the 1965 Voting Rights Act. This single piece of legislation is responsible for the enfranchisement of millions of Black men and women, the election of 1000s more, the elimination of gerrymandered districts and restrictive voting practices, and most recently, for the granting of political rights and representation to Black people outside of the Southern region. It must be renewed. 
If the fight for simple extension of the existing act is successfully waged, there are many and I am among them, who believe that other battles in this arena must be fought as well.  
One is for a national Voting ARights Act, legislation that will give the underregistered Black and brown people of the North and West the same protection enjoyed in this region now.  
Another is for a single system of post card registration, administered on the federal level, eliminating the petty obstacles of time and geography which conspire to keep a large portion of the potential American electorate unregistered. 
One final need is for the establishment of a national holiday for national elections, or at least, provision for holding such
12 
elections on Sunday, when the smallest portion of Americans are at work. 
Only when these steps are taken can we believe that every citizen has free and equal access to the franchise, and to the opportunity to pick and choose among the candidates who wish to govern us. 
In national affairs, Southern Black politicians are developing the regional muscle to deliver white votes in the United States House and Senate. In creating home rule for the District of Columbia and in constructing a constituency for repeal of the Byrd Amendment, it was the loosely organized network of small town mayors and rural county commissioners that insisted to their representatives in Congress that they cannot support racism in Rhodesia and enjoy Black support at home. 
On the local level, these women and men have restored confidence in elected officials and have made their governments become the delivery systems for goods and services they ought to be. 
They pave streets and pick up garbage; they make Johnny-Be-Good be good; they make office holding the high calling it is supposed to be. 
They refuse to be diverted by the romantic rhetoricians and second-hand victims of oppression. They insist on service, the demand that democracy now be made safe for them.
13 
I think the people of this region know that today is not like yesterday, and know that we are in a difficult period, a period in which there are no student caravans South, in which there are no visiting, sympathetic congressmen, a period in which no entertainers will dance and sing for them in small back country churches. 
I said, earlier in my remarks, that some people like to think of this problem as ""The Black Problem."" There are also those other Americans who come from groups of European immigrants—unlike us, voluntary immigrants, to be sure—who believe that since they have risen to influence and affluence, then Black people can easily do the same. And there are some who profess sympathy and understanding but ask ""What can I do?"" Frederick Douglass, in his 77th year, answered all of these questions: He said ""The marvel is that the old trick of misnaming things, so often displayed by Southern politicians, should have worked so well for the bad cause for which it is now employed, for the American people have fallen in with the bad idea that this is a Negro problem, a question of the character of the Negro, and not a question of the nation.... He has as little to do with the cause of the problem as he has to do with its cure. Now what the real problem is we all ought to know. It is not a Negro problem, but a national problem. It involves the question of whether after all our boasted civilization, our Declaration of Independence, our
14 
Constitution, our sublime Christianity, our statesmanship, we as a people, possess virtue enough to solve this problem. 
""But how can the problem be solved? Let the white people of the North and South conquer their prejudices. Let the American people cultivate kindness and humanity. Let them give up the idea that they can be free while making the Negro a slave. They are not required to do much. They are only required to undo the evil that they have done, in order to solve this problem.  
""Put away your race prejudice. Banish the idea that one class must rule over another. Recognize the facts that the rights of the humblest of citizens are as worthy of protection as are those of the highest and your problem will be solved, and whatever may be in store for you in the future, whether prosperity or adversity, whether you have foes without or foes within, whether there shall be peace or war, based on the eternal principles of truth, justice and humanity, with no class having cause for complaint or grievance, your republic will stand and flourish forever....""* "

As we approach the end of the first year of the decade of the 70s, there seems to be intense confusion in American life.
The confusion doesn't exist because we don't know what our problems are; it exists only because we either profess ignorance about methods of solving them, or have no real interest in having them solved.
The confusion surrounding black people, and our traditional difficulties with the so-called American way of life stems from our status in this country as a colonial people, and from the fact that we are increasingly being forced to employ the traditional methods and techniques of the colonial subject to escape from the oppression of the colonial power.
There are always objections made to the descriptions of ""us"" and ""them"" and as components of the colonial equation; the argument runs this way:
First we are told that we are nationalized Americans, and not a people of separate identity. We are told that the Constitution of the United States supports equal citizenship, and that our sub-Constitutional status is a matter of chance, and not design. And we are told that the racism which affects us is based on historical preference and not economic profit, as it has been in the historical model of African, Asian and Latin American colonialism.
We are citizens only in the narrow sense in that we must meet certain obligations to the state, without receiving all of the corresponding benefits of state citizenship. We all pay taxes,
2
but because more of us are poor, and because the poor pay more, and because some of the rich pay nothing, we pay more of our share for less of the rewards taxpayers rightfully expect.
Black and white men alike are subjected to the opportunity to serve this country militarily, but through this present attack by our country on the people of Southeast Asia, we have managed to become ] 3 first in war, last in peace, and seldom in the hearts of our countrymen.
While we - like most other Americans - came here as immigrants, but most immigrants came voluntarily, seeing freedom and a chance to survive. My ancestors came in chains, husband torn from wife, child from mother.
In a land where family and education are venerated, we were denied the chance to learn and to maintain a stable family unit. In a country populated with sufferers from religious prosecution, we found a strange and alien religion forced upon us.
While we came from a land whose inhabitants believed in communalism and the extended family, we x found created here a system of mercantilism mercantile capitalism that exactly fitted the cash-box mentality of the founding fathers.
From that day to this, the separate status of black people here has been a fact. From that day to this, we have been the Africans, suffering at the hands of the Europeans.
The argument is also made that blacks enjoy legal status here as do all Americans. Of course, on paper, that is largely true, but the plain facts are that certain constitutionally guaranteed
3
rights - like the right to vote and to enjoy other forms of social and political participation - are still subjected to intense debate, not only in the Southern states but in the White House itself.
In short, we are in bad shape. We live and work in situations provided for by the majority, not by us. We exist at the pleasure and sufferance of the American majority, and the evidence is mounting that that existance itself may soon be called into question.
3
that that existence itself may soon be called into question.
Part of the difficulty is that Tthe traditional solutions to our dillema - solutions employed with great success by other ethnic groups - will not mold themselves entirely to our deliverance.
Individual entrepreneurship has created a class of black millionaires in publishing, insurance and cosmetic fields, but ] 5 has done little for the economic uplift of most black people.
Pressure group politics has won many needed reforms for our group, but these reforms are nearly impossible to make secure in a colonial society.
We had believed, for instance, that the battle for the integrated school-room was won [illegible] in 1954, with only slight pressure needed from then on to finish the job.
The truth was that none of the administrations in Washington since then - particularly including this one - ever intended to make the dream of an integrated education a reality.
The traditional coalitions of black people, labor, the more enlightened church leadership have failed in bringing about the beloved society that was the dream of the early '60s.
The American labor movement has shown begun to show its true colors as black people began demanding not only labor connected goals like mimimum wages, but entry into the craft unions which have always been ] 6 lily white. The churches have understandably all too often played a gad-about role, black people today, the war in Vietnam tomorrow, abortion reform the next.
The hoped for coalition with white college students has
The hoped-for coalition with white college students has failed to materialize, as far too many of this group has have shown more interest in music, drugs, the romantic rhetoric of revolution and the enobling sacrifice of self-enforced poverty than in the very real problems of existence that afflict most black people in this country.
4
not materialized, as too many in this group hasve shown more interest in music, drugs, the romance of revolution and self-enforced poverty than in the human problems which affect every black person in this country.
So we are left to an ever spiraling scale of politics and then protest and then revolt, with the probable result theat increasing repression will follow.
Here is a description of the process:
""The people with fewest illusions about the welafre state are the poor who are served by it. When they protest, usually in the name of American ideals, an interesting reaction follows. Some among the ] 7 majority react sympathetically, though not always with real understanding of the causes. But a sufficient number of opposing interests are roused to prevent and any drastic change, and often even moderate changes are blocked. The poor, who in most cases begin by politely petitioning their governors, soon take more drastic steps, thinking they can perhaps awaken the conscience of the majority or at least the higher authorities. They do awaken the conscience of some people, and to some extent they force elites to concede token changes. But at the same time, a 'counterrevolution' is triggered against the potential of revolution which has been seen in the mounting protest. The system becomes deadlocked. No more than token reforms, crumbs, result for the protestors. The scale of their protest increases as they realize that appeals to conscience are inadequate. They look for methods of transcending the pressure politics that have worked. They begin civil disobedience and
5
disruption. The immediate reaction of the power structure is to maintain order. The police are bought ] 8 into the conflict. Considerations of social, political or economic solutions to the conflict are gradually replaced by the emphasis on law and order. Violent repression becomes routine.""1
It becomes clear from that analysis that the only escape from this trap is revolution, either violent on the part of both sides of a question, or a revolution in thinking, and play psychology on both sides of the equation. ,and political position on at least one side.
It is that second revolution that is bursting upon us today.
It springs, first of all, from the black community. It is a revolution in thinking about ourselves, a revolution turning upside down the analysis that had made us - the victims - describe ourselves as the causes of our own condition.
It is found most concretely in the growing desire among black people to reject the kind of tribalization of class and geography that has divided us for so long, and to bring us together as a ] 9 nation within this nation.
It is found in the rejection by black people of white standards of beauty and competence qualification that have plagued us for so long.
But we that will not do the job alone. We may - as we are slowly about to do - take over the major cities of this [illegible] country
6
and hold them as enclaves against increasing repression, charging admission fees to suburban whites who must come to the city for jobs and income, and who must depend on the city as a source of police protection and utility service.
But we would also like to depend on white America as a source of simple decency of treatment, a hope that many would call [illegible] extremely naive.
We would like, for example, to be treated as well as American farmers are. First they were given free lands. Then they were given low interest loans to enable them to buy farm machinery. Then the Department of Agriculture sent out farm agencts to show them ] 10 how to use their machines and to rotate their crops. Now we pay them not to do anything, a form of millionaire welfarism that is scorned for poor people.
Suppose, for example, that an ADC mother was paid not to produce at the same rate that gentleman farmer Senator James O. Eastland is. That would mean that welafre mothers in Detroit or Chicago or Los Angles could collect as much as $125,000 a year for not having babies.
But the revolution demands that we be allowed not more than but simply the same as other groups. Why we ask must patronage be abolished as a political reward when blacks take over the cities after it political favoritism has done so much for Italians and Irishmen? [illegible] Why must good government advocate metropolitanism as a panacea to urban ills at a time when we are about to take over some cities?

Why must some women - most of them white - and some homosexuals - most of them white - and some other groups insist that our liberation is dependent upon ours theirs? ] 11
The answer must be that no one - unless it is American Indians - has priority over the justifiable demands of black people. And that only black people can set the pace, techniques and methods used by black people in our struggle.
Foremost among these must be political action, but not the old style of machine politics or the unequal black - labor - liberal- coalition that we have entered into like a willing bridegroom so many times in the past, only to emerge ravished and our innocence gone.
Our politics must be an aggressive independent politics, free from any alliances of party or partisanship that has made us slaves first to the party of Lincoln and then now to the party of Roosevelt.
We must begin to seize power where we are, in the cities and the black belt counties of the Old Confederacy. As [the] whites flee these areas for the comfort and security of the suburbs, they create a political vacuum that we must fill. ] 12
But the cities are crumbling beneath us, and the prescence of a black mayor alone will not insure that these decaying compounds will be livable again.
The black inhabitants of rural America have a better chance at achieving a decent life, for the cost of living is lower there and the people know better how to live, but even these victors will discover that political gains can be destroyed by an economy that still remains in the hands of the plantation bosses.
8
So as we get our politics together, we must try to get our economics together as well. This means that while we reject the obviously absurb Nixonian notion of black capitalism, we must not hesitate to accept any economic advantage that might accrue to our group as a whole.
This means striving for economic plans as different as the designs plotted by the Honorable Elijah Muhhamad in the South to the ] 13 neighborhood cooperatives springing up in ghettoes across the country to the transfer of mom-and-pop stores from white hands to black ones as well as any other plan or scheme that will put money into the pockets of black people.
Finally, we
It means that we cannot afford the luxury available to so many dilletants on the left who seek to define for us what is right and what is wrong - indeed, even what is black - in our struggle. At a time when our community seems about to draw together an alliance of cultural nationalists and political activists, of poverty workers and poverty livers, of foot washing Baptists and the Nation of Islam, we cannot afford a Woodstock in a nation that still tolerates Watts; we cannot demand liberation for special groups until the whole group goes free.
That suggests that the fragile sometime security of the college campus is not the proper place from which to engage in remote criticism of people who seldom see a book from year to year; that the prescence of ROTC on the campus is not nearly as earthshaking an issue ] 14 as the prescence of rats in the ghetto; that debates about the relative revisionism of the late Ho Chi Minh had best be neglected until we have started our own revolution here.
Finally, we must prepare for a time of trouble. If the provisions of the criminally insane Washington, D.C. Crime Act are any indication, or the unwillingness of the House Internal Security Committee to help abolish the concentration camp features of the McCarran Act are a signal for the future, then we had better beware and prepare for hard times ahead.
Through these hard times, we might prepare ourselves with the words of Frederick Douglass, who in 1894 was asked how the race problem might be solved. He said then:
""Let the white people of the North and South conquer their prejudices......Let the American people cultivate kindness and humanity.....Let them give up the idea that they can be free ] 15 while making the Negro a slave. Let them give up the idea that the degrade the colored man is to elevate the white man......
""They are not required to do much. They are only required to undo the evil they have done, in ourder to solve their problem.......
""Put away your race predjudice. Banish the idea that one class must rule over another. Recognize the fact that the rights of the humblest of citizens are as worthy of recognition as therights of the highest, and your problem will be solved, and - whatever may be in store for you in the future, whether prosperity or adversity, whether you have foes without or foes within, whether there shall be peace or war - based on the eternal principles of truth, justice and humanity, with no class having cause for complaint or greivance, your Republic will stand and flourish forever.""2

From the days of the early '60's when Black people in the South began an epic movement that soon spread throughout the land until today in 1972 some profound changes have been won.
From the struggle to sit in the front of the bus, to the struggle to sit down at the lunch counters, to the struggle to sit in in an integrated school room, to the final struggle to stand up in the polling places of the states of the Old Confederacy, these diverse battles have each had something in common.
In each, there were fully and clearly defined goals supported by nearly the entire Black community.
In each, there was mass participation in the Black community, from bar-fly to bourgeosie, from doctor to domestic, from preacher to pimp, from student to striver.
2
Some joined in reluctantly, because it meant breaking the habits and accomodations of a lifetime. Others had - as too many of us have today - a vested interest in maintaining the status quo. But when the lunch counters integrated or jobs became available, everyone was there.
In the sixties, on the picket line, we picketed together. Today, we picket each other. In the sixties in the movement, we shared and raised our own money. Today, we shake each other down.
In the sixties, you demonstrated your commitment through your action; today, you demonstrate your Blackness through the length of your hair and the trickiness of your handshake.
In the sixties, our young people were in the vanguard; today, too many bounce between bid whist, the bougaloo and Boone's Farm.
In the sixties, we had great leaders - in the seventies, we have only ourselves.
This change occurred through several factors. We in the South
3
discovered that putting a pair of pants with empty pockets on a lunch counter stool was a beautiful - but empty - gesture.
We found that the location of your bus seat was meaningless when the bus only took you from the feudal economic system of the South to mechanized high rise poverty in the North.
And voting become useless too when the candidates were tweedledum and tweedledee.
But the sixties showed that change would occur when there were two connected factors: a united and aggressive Black community and a national will toward progress.
Today's Black community is still aggressive, perhaps a trifle less united, but the national will is gone.
It began to vanish when Blacks in Hough and Watts and Newark and Detroit decided that freedom now meant them too. It began to vanish when aggressive war against brown people in Asia became more important than
4
bringing prosperity to Black people at home.
It vanished when busing stopped being transportation and began to be integration, and when a politics based on fear and hatred of Black people took over the White House.
We helped, too. We helped by artificially and arbitrarily dividing ourselves into integrationists and nationalists, into middle class and poor, as though there was more than one way to catch hell for being Black in America.
We are now where we were twelve years ago. Changes were made in the decade of the sixties, but the changes were made in the fifties as well.
At the end of those two decades, we found a faltering national mood, a national administration reluctant to administer to Black needs, a national consciousness eager to have us - and all our problems - slip from the American scene.
That mood was shattered first in Montgomery with marching feet and then in every Southern city at lunch counter stools.
5
That movement became political, and forced change on one of the political parties, made Black men Mayors and Congressmen.
It is largely forgotten now. Today's Black youth know more about what happened during Reconstruction than they do about what happened ten years ago.
Now the stage is set for a new beginning.
What is happening now happened once before in American history in the years after Reconstruction. The promises that Black people would be included in the social and economic life of the nation were repudiated. Instead of fulfilling the dream, then and now:
- The white crusaders for social justice and democracy became weary as Black people could no longer be considered a purely Southern problem;
- The aspirations for and movement of Blacks began to be curtailed by organized violence and barbarity and by a series of legal maneuvers designed to make Black men less than political and economic equals;
6
the hopes and beliefs of Black people that racial equality and social justice would be achieved through litigation, legislation, negotiation, occasional direct action or strong alliances with liberal groups were supplanted by disillusionment, bitterness and open anger;
- the guilt and indignation of Northern supporters of the Southern drive for equality turned into an attitude of cautious - and now open - racism when the Northern Black man began to take seriously the claims and progress and began to look for visible signs in Northern cities. We have now finished with the two great national conventions that chose the four white men, two of whom Black people - and all other Americans - will suffer or prosper under the next four years.
In a few short weeks, all Americans will go to the polls to choose between these men, and to choose what the future for us will be. The next president of the United States will have an effect on all
7
our lives.
He will place his men on the Supreme Court, and will turn it back into the activist liberal force it used to be or will continue its present trend toward facism.
He will name directors and set budgets and policies for the Departments of Justice, of Health, Education and Welfare, of Housing and Urban Development, and for the Federal Bureau of Investigation.
He will decide whether the American aggression against the innocent people of Southeast Asia continues, and will decide whether the American troops there now come home marching upright, or lying down in pieces in pine boxes.
He will decide whether stocks go up or down; whether money is loose or tight, whether our weekly paychecks buy more or less or whether we have any pay checks at all.
Our common fate hangs in the balance in November. We can - between now and then - build a political movement strong enough to make equality a reality instead of an empty promise.
That effort itself requires a maximum effort on our part. It requires, first of all, a massive voter registration drive in every town and hamlet in America where we are.
This is especially true outside the South. It is a matter of some bitter amusement to those of us South of the Mason-Dixon line to know there are proportionately more Black people registered to vote in Selma,
14
Alabama than there are in Brooklyn, New York.
Coupled with such a registration drive must come a nation-wide legal attack on archaic and restrictive registration laws, laws which differ from state to state and even from town to town, laws which usually discriminate not against Blacks as a racial group, but against the poor as a class.
But legal restrictions are not the only barrier to voting among us. A Census Bureau study done in 1968 reported that 13% fewer registered Blacks than whites voted in the '68 election and a Columbia University study showed that only 43% of New York City's Blacks vote regularly at all.
This apathetic attitude comes partly from the culture of poverty so many of us are forced to live in, and partially from the healthy cynicism we have had to develop toward a political and economic system never really meant for our benefit.
But a more basic failure is found in the fabric of Black life in America with its failures and frustrations, its often romantic rhetoric
15
and its raw reality.
Some of the rhetoric of the past several years - from our communities as well as from those who purport to be our friends - has turned us away from our own best interests.
For example, later this summer, just before election day, you are going to begin hearing some self-appointed spokesman for Black people urging us not to vote at all, or to vote against our own self interests.
Those who urge us not to vote are the willing accomplices of the fascist forces in America who believe the only good Black voter is one who does not vote.
Those Blacks who for their own selfish motives urge us to vote for the man who gave us Carswell and Haynesworth and ""benign neglect"" are members of a new American political party - neither Democrats nor Republicans nor Independents - these new practioners of politics belong to the ""I've Got Mine"" party, the Rip-Off the Man and My People party, the Take the Money and Run party.
16
Their political allegiances are not tied to party or principle but to pennies; not to devotion to race and pride in self but to devotion to dollars and the race for power, not to the beauty in Blackness but to bigness in bankbooks.
They praise the President as the ""greatest saviour since Jesus Christ""; they applaud the wizard of the wiretap, the architect of law and order, the former Attorney General; and wonder of wonders, they attend a formal dinner party honoring the old Dixie-Crat himself, Strom Thurmond.
And after all this, they have the temerity to go before Black audiences, and tell us ""Don't be taken for granted. Give the man one more chance.""
If one more chance means more of the last four years, I'd rather be taken for granted than just plain taken.
But it is a choice we must make.
It is a choice of Nixon-omics and Mitchell's mixups; of continuation of criminal war abroad and a war against the poor people at home; of benign neglect of the poor and tax favors for the rich, of four more years of the un-holy coalition of big business, yesterday's South, and the rabid right wing, four more years of vanishing civil liberties and decaying civil rights, four more years of American leadership coming from Uncle Strom's Cabin.
That is four more years we cannot afford. Think what it will mean to have four more years of agressive, arrogant power, four years more of a president who knows he cannot be re-elected again and who will use those years * secure in the knowledge he cannot be defeated in 1976 because he cannot run then - to shape this country into his vision of what it should be.
Those are your choices.

In each of the great movements of the '60s, money was no real problem. Money came from Northern liberals, when liberal was still a good word, and we raised some of our money ourselves.
In the '60s on the picket line, we picketed together. Today, we picket each other. In the '60s in the movement, we shared and raised our own money. Today, wh we shake each other down.

But for Black people, other issues intrude.
Of necessity, we are interested in the economy, in the war, in every aspect of American life, here and abroad.
Prosperity for the nation generally means pro prosperity for us. Prosperity for Peace abroad usually means peace at home for us.
The fate of Chicanos in Texas; of Puerto Ricans in New York; of poor people everywhere is intertwined with ours.

not an exact text
About 100 years ago, the great Black scholar and teacher, Dr. W. E. B. DuBois, correctly stated that the problem of the 20th Century would be the problem of the color line.
In those few words he correctly summed up the crisis that has occupied both men and nations, the crisis that has become the first order of business for millions of oppressed peoples around the globe.
It is a struggle which in this country has broken out on every college campus; it has been taken to the streets of most cities in this country, both violently and non-violently.
It is a vital part of the international struggle that inspired Cuban canecutters to overthrow a dictator; a part of the struggle that has inspired 20 years of successful resistance by Vietnamese peasants.
It is a part of the ongoing battle that inspires Alabama and Mississippi share croppers to risk life and limb in order to have a chance at controling their own destiny.
Scholars like Dr. DuBois at one time believed that scientific and rational study of the problems of race and class would yeild rational and logical
2
solutions; civilized man, or educated man, would solve his problems in a civilised manner.
But of course, the problems of the 20th Century have been so vast that many men have quite properly been urged to seek uncivilised solutions to them.
These problems include the poisioning of the air and water; the rape of the land; the new colonizing of peoples, both here and abroad; and the continuing and escalating contest between those who have and those who have not.
In 1972, these problems - particularly as defined by Dr. DuBois - have become more apparent.

[Attached to this page is the following typed note.] In this section, where ""Playboy"" appears, write: an American magazine
In mid September 1971 the National Urban Coalition issued a report, 3 years later, commenting on its the famous 1968 Kerner Commission Report.
To no one's surprise, they found: 
- housing for the poor is still the disgrace it was then; 
- rates for crime, unemployment, disease and drug addiction are higher than ever before 
- welfare rolls are larger while appropiations for the needy are less 
- American cities are in trouble, poverty continues in the midst of wealth, malnutrition is widespread, war continues, racism runs rampant, injustice persists, and tensions endure.
Nearly at the same time, Playboy magazine issued a report, a survey of what America's college youth, the presumed future leaders of this nation, the present inheritors of a rich tradition of youth-directed progressive struggle against evil and wrong, think about the current issues of the day.
The Playboy survey begins ominously with the notation that college heroes have been transformed from Mario
4
Savio and Bobby Dylan half a decade ago to Howdy Doody and Buffalo Bob today.
That has been the response of the most liberally educated, best informed, generation in history. According to Playboy, 35% of you are ""very worried"" about race; 45% are just plain ""worried""; 20% are ""not worried at all.
That is the ""worriedness"" chart of the sons and daughters of the '60s the savior's of the 70s, the inheritors of American liberalism, the generation we are told - annually, at commencement - will lead us to freedom.
[Handwritten arrows point to an attached typed note with the following sentence.] Arriving at that stagnation point from your natural roots as inheritors of a revolutionary process - the revolution that gave America birth - to the campus stillness of 1972 is easily traceable.
5
But wWith the birth of the collosus called the United States, rational and educated men everywhere began to believe that cil civilization stretched to its highest order had begun.
Building on a heritage of popular revolution, expressing a belief in the equality of most - if not of all men, this new democracy was to be the highest elevation of men's relationships to each other, a new beginning of decency between nations.
Men of learning then defined civilization as the processes of imposing limits on war, encouraging the spread of industrialization, the civilizing and a-cutturation of what were called heathen elements, and the harnessing of nature for the economic benefit and social pleasure of man.
It was believed then that man's better nature would triumph over his base desire to conquer, rule and make war, and that culture, intellect, reason and logic would share equally with man's fate.
Of course, it has just not been so. Man still makes war, he still insists that the wishes and desires of one group be subordinated to that
6
of others, he still insists on gathering selfish material wealth at the expense of his fellows and his environment.
Men and nations have continued their arrogance, and the struggle of the 20th Century has intensified
The educated peoples of the world have enslaved the ignorant; the rich and propertied classes have dominated the dispossed; the white minorities of the globe have conspired with their self-defined divine sanction to chrush the non-white peoples of the earth.
Revolutionary nations like the United States - that is to say revolutionary 200 years ago - have turned toward counter-revolution.
The result has been the stifiling of the demand of the 20th Century's underclass, and when that demand is stifled, when there is an absence of a healthy political response, violence ensues.
It is a violence of a certain kind, however,
- the violence of Black children going to school for 12 years and emerging with six years of education; 
- the violence of 30 million hungry stomachs in the richest country on the face of the earth;
7
- the violence of having Black young men represent a disproportionate share of the causuallies and inductees in Vietnam, making them first in war, last in peace, and seldom in the hearts of their countrymen; 
- the violence of spending $900 every second to stifle the Vietnamese, and $77 dollars per poor person per year to feed the hungry at home; 
- violence is chastizing Black and poor people as lazy and shiftless because many of us are on relief, while these same critics ignore the 6,000 white American farmers who are paid $25,000 each and more not to farm; 
- it is violent for the Congress of the United States to place the interests of cotton, tobacco, rice and cattle ahead of people. 
- the ultimate violence and the penultimate pornography is to be governed by such middle minded medeocraties as Richard Nixon and Spiro Agnew.
But an alternative to that kind of violence exists; an antidote that was begun with Denmark Vesey and Nat Turner, was given impetus by Dr. DuBois and the Niagra Movement,
8
was spurred by Martin Luther King and hundreds of famous and thousands of nameless fighters for freedom.
But movements for social good in this country are not sustained by the hopeful and daring actions of a few, but by the dreary, grass roots action of the many.
The chance at power in the United States comes as you know not from seizing a dean, but from seizing welfare office; not from believing God will provide, but from believing that the lord helps them who help themselves not from just being clean for 'Gene in '68 or even ready for Teddy in '72, but by being prepared for the long, hard, everyday task of building a left-of-center movement in America that can capture the courthouse, the state-house and the White House, and can carry out the process of transfering power, services and resources from those who hoard them to those who have them not.
This is not easy work. It is not easy because in an era of doing your own thing, no one wants to do for and with those people whose thing is winning and retaining the right to live.
9
It only requires that rhetoric be turned into action, that schoolbook knowledge be turned into street situations, that theories be turned into practice.
It will require that their be heightened interest in political activism, organization, and coalition between now and November, 1972.
It will require that politics must mean people and their problems, and not just candidates and their elections.
For too many Americans, particularly for too many affluent white, young, Americans, an exchange of Presidents is nothing more than an exchange of photographs on the Post Office Wall, or a different face on a dormitory wall dart board.
For Black and poor Americans, the issue is whether we progress, run in place, or continue sliding backward as we have been doing since 1968.
Since the present president took office, we have spent billions more on war, dropped more explosives on the rice-paddies and dykes of South East Asia, in 3 years than his predecessor did in 4, over 2 million more Americans have been added to the ranks of the unemployed; 2.5 million more are on ever mounting relief rolls, the
10
racist, elitist and sexist policies of public and private American institutions have continued to insure that Blacks and other oppressed people will suffer more than others, in good times and in bad.

The process of choosing who will oppose whom in November is already completed.
The selection of a new president in one vein is rather easy; anyone beside the incumbent will do.
The running mate is less important, and must be considered only because this person could become president. It ought not be considered any real victory to have a Black, or female, or Jewish Vice-President, or a Vice President who happened to be all three; whomever it is will always do what the president says must be done.
A new Congress - all of the members of the U.S. House of Representatives and many of the members of the U.S. Senate will be chosen in 1972 as well.
For the most part, these must be new men and women, not the tired old faces of the past.
It should be a congress that would reject President Nixon's family destruction plan, a Congress that would say no to more war, a Congress that would say no
11
to freezes on wages with no freezes on profits, no to J. Edgar Hoover's Patrick Grey's Federal Bureau of Intimidation no to military millions for 20th Century imperialism, no to Nixonomics and Mitchell's mixups, and no to the systematic destruction of Black people, our few jobs, our homes, our families, our very lives.
W It is not sufficient, however, to be against evil; everyone is, each in his own way. Nor can you demand only the assertion of good from the candidate you support; each must have a program.
Ending the war by bringing the troops home and ending all logistical and air support to Chairman Theiu is of first priority.

In recent weeks, antiwar sentiment should have escalated.
Over 15 million Vietnamese live in the Red River basin. The density in the Delta is from 700 to 800 inhabitants per square kilometer. In 1945, when the Japanese provoked the rupture of the diykes, more than 2 million were killed. In 1966, when the United States bombed the ocean diykes, untold thousand other deaths resulted.
If the present bombing is continued, not only with will death from flooding occur, but additional deaths from famine, as well.
The American precedent for such destruction was taken established during the Korean War when, in 1953, the U.S. Air Force was authorized to destroy all North Korean irrigation dams.
The CIA proposed such bombing of river diykes in Vietnam in 1967, a plan opposed by Robert McNamara who said ""There may be a limit beyond which many Americans and the rest of the world would not permit the United States to go.""
Apparently that limit has not yet been reached, if the events of recent weeks are any indication.
It has become clear that dykes are being bombed, that it is part of a plan calculated to put the Vietnames people under water. After having survived American interference and agression for over two decades, the North Vietnamese now must face the further prospect of being washed off the territory they have secured through years of sacrifice in the face of the American war machine.
In history's most recent example in the annals of what has been called ""civilized"" warfare, the Germany High Commissioner for Holland ordered the Dutch dykes to be opened. For this vicious act of destruction, he was labled ""one of the worst war criminals"" at the Nuremburg War Crimes Tribunal. Out of 186 defendants, he was one of only 24 Germans sentenced to death. It is important to rember that the standards for defining war crimes were largely set by the United States herself, 26 years ago.
The question for tiday - while blood stillruns in Vietnam and running water may loosed by American bombs may kill thousands more - is how this process may be halted.
In no particular order of priority follow:
- permanent job creation programs not tied to national employment rates 
- the granting of cease and desist powers to the EEOC, coverage of small employers, elimination of the exemption of state and local governments and educational institutions
- replacing the present welfare system with a guaranteed adequate income system, setting a satisfactory minimum of $6500 a year for a 
12
family of four 
- a revenue sharing program which guarantees neighborhood and community planning for fund disbursement, coupled with federal incentives to require the states to shift from regressive to progressive taxes. 
- an increase in funding for OEO, 
- increased financial support for predominately Black institutions of higher learning. 
- the release of $150 million dollars for new public housing 
- the implementation of the Uniform Relocation Act to insure an adequate stock of low and moderate housing for displaced persons. 
- the appointment of Black federal judges, U.S. Attorneys, U.S. Marshalls, and federal correctional officers. 
- the repealing of the ""no-knock"" and ""preventive detention"" provisions of the D.C. Crime Bill. 
- full voting representation and home rule for the District of Columbia 
- a reduction of military expenditures, and redirection of those funds to domestic programs. 
- an increase of foreign aid to Black Africa up to 15% of the total worldwide aid budget.
13
- political and economic isolation of South Africa
These are a small part of the demands a thinking constituency ought to make on candidates for the president.
It can be done partially by involving yourself in my profession, in politics, in the second oldest profession in the world.
You will face several difficulties if you do.
The first will come from those people who will tell you that politics is useless and accomplishes nothing.
These are the same people who in 1968 told you that Richard Nixon's election would be a good thing, because in their words it would ""heighten the contradictions"" and hasten the revolution.
That's fine in campus revolutionary theory, but its Black people's contradictions that are being heightened, not theirs.
These are the spiritual descendants of the people in Germany in the 30s who urged the election of Adolph Hitler for the same people.
Others around you will say that politics is a bourgeoise trip, designed to get the young out of the streets and into
14
the system!
What streets? Where? These are the same children of middle America, mostly college bred - a 4-year loaf on the old man's dough - who are locked in the middle of the educational system, preparing to be doctors, lawyers, butchers and teachers, and loving it.
Finally, the objector will tell you that a choice between the lesser of two evils is no choice at all. This from a people who took without complaint a lesser choice for college, a lesser choice for a date at the high school prom, and for many of you, a lesser choice for what you'd rather be doing right now . , that rings rather hollow.
[Attached here is a typed note with the following instructions.] page 14 insert, after ...no choice at all (delete following sentence up to ...that rings rather hollow.
If you see no chouice then you have made your choice, not only for yourself, but from for millions of poor people who have not got your sophisticated sensors that allows you the luxury of more life four more years of life under Nixon.
[On verso of typed note is the following fragment.] If you can make a case that you'd rather leave that choice
Politics is not the art of the possible, as you may have been taught in high school civics, or the art of compromise, as you may have been taught in political science 101, but a more delicate and exacting art - the art of seeing who gets how much of what from whom.
That promise stated, one of the major directions Black and poor and dispossed people must move toward in the remainder of the 70s is toward
15
a real participation in a new politics.
That is because it is politics that decides, regardless of where you live or what political or economic system that you profit or suffer from, what kind of life each of us will have, what kind of world we live in, what kind of future our children will have.
Politics sent our sons and brothers and uncles and fathers to Southeast Asia to shoot and kill and be killed by other mother's sons; politics will bring them back alive.
Politics has set unemployment for Black people at two and three times the national average. It has made us the last to be hired and the first to be fired.
Our politics ought to be different and new, and independent.
[Attached note has the following instructions.] delete from: ""What we must strive for.... to page 16 .....as what he can be committed to by then.
What we must strive for with or without that vanishing American species, people of good will, is to free ourselves from the slavish allegiance we have play had in the past for the Democratic Party.
We gave the Democrats 20% of their vote in 1968. 98% of all of the Blacks who voted then went
16
all the way with L.B.J. in 1964 and through the hoop with the Hump in 1968.
We have got to find some way to stop being the illegitimate child at the family reunion, having to sit in the kitchen f while the family members - the military-labor complex, the politically promiscous white South, the corrupt big city machines, - divide all the gravy.
We have got to develop the mechanism to carry us between two overwhelming and contradictory impulses - the desire to permanently retire Richard Nixon from public office, and the feeling that 1972 is the year to stop being the last unrewarded Democrats in the United States.
The election choice in November, 1972, will probably may only be between two Anglo-Saxon men, in their 50s or older.
One of these two will probably be named Richard Nixon; the other candidate's name is not as important as what he can be committed to by then.
In 1968, out of a voting population of 120 million people, only 73 million voted. Richard Nixon received 31 million votes, but half as many people,
17
47 million, did not vote at all. Those figures could be reversed, the architects of the national southern strategy could be retired
It could be done by people like yourselves.
[An attached typed note at this location has the following instructions.] insert page 17 after ""....like yourselves, 
You helped gather several millions together to protest the war over the last decade. Those crowds were largely white, and the anti-war movement felt itself open to charges of racism, and muttered in its membership that Black people didn't have the war as a first priority.
That's partially true. Our first priority is with life, our lives, and the lives of our children.
You can give that concern for life some primacy in November, if you undertake the massive task now of registering voters, organizing blocks, and turning out the millions of people like yourselves who can eliminate Richard Nixon if they will or will aid in our elimination by your inaction.
The Vietnamese people have told you what to do.
It will never be done if your major concern is the romantic rhetoric of revolution; if you care more for music, drugs, macrobiotic diets and the romantic rh astrology than you do for people; if you believe social commitment can be measured by the length of your hair or the intricacy of your handshake; if you think you can smoke America to her knees; if you think radical social change and revolution can be plotted on television; or if you can find solace in Bid Whist and Boone's Farm. 
Remember, if you undertake this task, some words from that great Black abolilionist, Frederick Douglass, who said:
""Men may not get all they pay for in this world, but they certainly must pay for all they get. If we ever get free from the opression and wrong that is heaped upon us, we must pay
18
for their removal. We must do this by labor, by sacrifice, by suffering, and if need be, by our lives and the lives of others.""

By that, we can mean our political, educational, or economic business. In general, we mean our ability to have some control over our own lives.
That single impulse is the great motivator among all men - it inspired American immigrants many years ago to fight a war for independence; it inspired Cuban canecutters to overthrow a dictator; it has inspired Alabama sharecroppers and Mississippi cotton pickers to risk their lives in their attempts to register to vote; it is inspiring the heroic Vietnamese in their successful struggle to overthrow the blue eyed aggressors from America.
There can be no doubt that things have generally improved over the past 352 years for most of us. We can now sit downstairs in movie theatres;
2
can ride in the front of busses; can go to schools we used to get bused past; can eat at lunch counters where we were never welcome before.
Despite that improvement, we obviously have a long way to go. A Black Georgian who lived one hundred years ago, Henry McNeil Turner, correctly described our condition then. His words are all too true today.
He said then: ""We have pioneered a civilisation here. We have built up your country. We have worked in your fields, we have gathered your harvests, for 250 years....We, who number hundreds of thousands...have not a foot of land to call our own. We are strangers in the land of our birth, without money, without education, without aid, without a roof to cover us while we live or clay to cover us when we die.""
It might be argued that conditions have improved a bit since then, but objectively, things are still pretty much the same.
The traditional ladders of upward financial mobility open to the voluntary immigrants who came to these shores seeking freedom from
3
oppression were closed to us, America's single group of involuntary arrivals. The European/American drew his strength from his ability to retain and draw from his European culture, while the African/American saw his culture, language, religion and family destroyed. As slavery passed from the scene, we entered into a permanent phase of un- and under-employment from which we have yet to emerge, while the European found that growth of mercantile capitalism especially fitted to his cashbox mentality.
We have had to endure physical and verbal abuse, take hand me down housing...cast off clothes...raggedy pawn shop furniture...third and fourth hand books...debilitated automobiles for transportation...spend exhorbitant bus, train and subway fares to get to our jobs which never gave us dignity when we got to them, and yet we are still told we have to pull ourselves up by our bootstraps.
This is a cruel suggestion for a people without any boots at all. But we have survived. We wear our battle scars proudly and continue to move and mobilize our people to obtain the right to a decent life where
4
our culture, our beauty, our soul can be reflected in the kind of ways necessary to make our communities politically whole and financially stable.
Moving in this direction we must begin taking advantage of the various methods available to us. We should not single out any one method or way to make ourselves free.
With our history of oppression and the current and past climate of repression aimed at us, with the might of government aimed at protecting the power of the few who have against the many who have not, with the official economic policy of the United States socialism and welfare millionarism for the wealthy and capitalism and free enterprise for the poor, it is no wonder that economic development stands high on our list of priorities.
Richard Nixon and his supporters are somewhat proud of their accomplishments in the field of minority enterprise. On paper it seems as if the present administration has accrued quite a record.
The question that still remains is what real effect, if any, did
5
this have on the Black businessman and the total Black community. A Commerce Department census study done in 1970 found that there are 332,000 minority businesses that collectively do $10.6 billion to business. These figures show that while minority entrepreneurs are four percent of the total business population of the U.S., they only account for 9.7 percent of the total receipts. On neither count do we come close to the 17 percent figure that would be necessary for the parity that is desired.
Despite the much publicized efforts of the Nixon administration, its minority program has not been an overwhelming success. The fact is, that the position of Blacks in America has not changed substantially during the last four years. While the GNP of the total Black community was $39 billion dollars in 1970, the median income of a Black family was $6,270. That figure is only two thirds as much as their white counterpart; and is not a real gain over the $6,191 median income figure from 1969. Consumer prices rose during 1970, so in terms of constant dollars, the median family income
6
of Blacks in 1970 was about the same as 1969.
This same lack of accomplishment is seen in almost every other area. Blacks only account for 6% of the population in institutions of higher education. And only 3.5% of those enrolled actually earn a degree, as compared with 9.1% for the total population.
The incidence of Black home ownership is 18 times smaller than that for whites. Of the Black working population, 27.9% are employed in white collar positions while more than half of the white working force have such jobs.
Within the Black community, it can be said that the war on poverty has been surrendered. 3.1% of the Black population live on earnings that place them below the recognized poverty line. This number is three times the figure for the whole community.
If we are seriously talking about changing the position of the Black man in America we must be talking about more intensive, extensive and expensive programs from the federal government. If we look just at the
7
area of minority enterprise, with the goal of expanding the gross receipts of the nation's minority businessmen from its present figure or less than 1% of the 17% we are entitled to, in terms of our population; it would require an increase in government spending from the presently spent $11 billion to almost $105 billion.
Earlier last year, the 13 members of the Black congressional caucus, presented president Nixon with a list of economic requests.
The basic list included:

A permanent job creation program with jobs targeted for urban and rural areas with chronically high employment conditions.
A federal public works employment program designed to create $1,100,000 full time new jobs during its first year of operation.
Immediate upgrading of minority Veterans Administration employees who have been historically confined to jobs in grade GS-8 or less.
Improvements in the selection, testing and promotion procedures
8
	in federal agencies so as to insure equal employment opportunities.
Vigorous enforcement of affirmative action codes where there is abuse of equal employment opportunity laws, guidelines and codes.
A new development bank with an initial appropriation of $1 billion to aid minority businesses.
Use federal deposit insurance corporation assets to provide assistance to minority firms.
An increase of $25 million to currently proposed $25 million for community development corporations which provide technical assistance to ghetto firms.
Require contractors on federally aided construction projects to set aside a specified percentage of their subcontracting work for minority-owned firms.
An increase in the federal management and technical assistance now available to minority trade groups and similar associations of minority businessmen.

The president rejected each one.
9
Despite the pleas for more federal assistance to the Black community generally, despite a well spelled out plan for economic assistance to the Black community generally, the present administration continues to maintain the the business system, not the government, will save us from economic destitution. The business system knows better. A much more candid statement of what business will and will not do under existing circumstances is the following from the publisher of the Bankers Magazine. He says:
""Despite all the exhortations at business symposiums, social and economic threats inherent in racial schism and violence in America have not yet reached the crisis proportions which would make business anti-poverty efforts a vital business need — essential to the continuance of corporate profits, the preservation of capital, or the survival of commerce. As long as this is the case, effort by private business to rehabilitate...the ghetto economy... will fail since the effort does not fulfill essential corporate needs or the need to make a profit,
10
whatever is being sold to whomever for whichever reason.""
The author of that statement is also the founder of the Atomic Energy Law Journal, a director of the Bank Tax Institute and currently Chairman of the Banking Law Institute. He is saying very clearly that Black people will never have economic freedom unless we muster the force to threaten or counter or nearly parallel the existence of the entire American economic system. He is right about how far we will have to be prepared to go if we are ever going to be free. We had better face the situation and get ourselves ready to take care of business, whether it is the kind of business he represents, or the kind of humanistic, non-capitalistic business that represents commerce in human relationships, not in dollars and cents.
As Cross said in his book on Black capitalism, ""The painfully apparent features of the ghetto economy are its economic weakness, a low level of productivity, and the poverty level of its consumers.""1
Dr. Kenneth Clark's description of our neighborhood, the ghetto, as
11
a ""social, educational, political and economic colony"" is especially important for us to remember.
What we must do, I believe, is connect positive programming with the various groupings of Black people who are striving towards the same goal.
For instance, in Alabama the SWAFCA program is currently engaged in developing land programs and collectively farming the land. Black people now own substantial acreage and are producing needed food and fiber for other Black people. Yet little recognition of this worthwhile program has come from the Black businessmen of the North, Midwest or Western cities who are developing their own economic programs to promote Black business. These plans, like that presently underwritten by the Honorable Elijah Muhammad in the South, operations which put Black people into a healthy and productive relationship with land, must receive national support.
Furthermore, we ought to strive toward further collectivization of our economic thrust, so that we do not get caught up in the degrading practice
12
of some of us obtaining all the wealth while our brothers and sisters are still hungry.
It is cruel and criminal to have outmoded capitalism thrust upon us, either dressed in Black or under its new, presumably less offensive name, minority entrepreneurship. Capitalism has not solved white people's problems. If it had, engineers in Seattle would not be driving taxi cabs today. What we need is something more properly described as ""community socialism"", enabling a larger share of us to get our hands on the dollars that pass through, and all too often, out, of our community. That means that if an economic enterprise does business in our community, we have to stop being consumers but must become owners as well. As much as I despise racketeering, prostitution and the numbers, if these are to be tolerated by the white controlled law enforcement agencies that rule this country, then we must control them too. It is too much to keep from even making a dishonest dollar in our own community.
13
In short, we must control what exists where we are. We must always strive for the greatest good for the largest number of us.
That means trying to control General Motors as much as it means trying to take over the corner mom and pop store, although the first is unlikely and the second may simply exchange color of the neighborhood cheats.
If the second is done, however, it may lay the foundation for a series of growth steps for us leading from our store to our farm to our distribution system to what is most important, money in the pockets of our people.
If the first is done, and General Motors through some miracle should fall into our hands, it might mean we could build an automobile that would last for more than eighteen months.
If both these adventures are begun, begun seriously with our people in mind and their interests foremost, then something must succeed.
If nothing does and if, as it appears it will, times get harder, then we had better seriously prepare to take care of business ourselves.

That is because it is politics that decides - in the end - what kind of life each of us will have, what kind of world we live in, what kind of futures our children will have.
It is politics that sent our sons and brothers and uncles and fathers to Southeast Asia, to shoot and kill and be killed by other mother's sons in a war made by politicians; it is politics that will bring them back.
It is politics that decides that unemployment for Black people will remain at two and three times the national average, and it is politics that decides that we will live in a permanent depression, ] 2 and it is politics that can put money in our pock pockets and give us jobs or a liveable - not laughable - income now.
It is politics that decides that we must live in second and third-hand homes that others have discarded or in vertical prisons of concrete and glass that designed by some architect who lives in the suburbs. thinks poor people. It is politics that made it impossible for so many of us to earn a living back home, and ran us into the cities to be squeezed together like sardines in a can, and it is politics that will enable us to take over the cities where we live, and turn them into the kinds of places where everyone wants to [live] live and raise their children.
insert 2
It is politics that makes us the last the be hired and the first to be fired; that gives our kids twelve years of school but only ] 3 six years of education; that has made us first in war on the battlefield, but last in peace, and seldom in the hearts of our countrymen.
Finally, it will be politics that decides whether you get $[illegible] $6,500.00 or year or $2,400.00; whether mothers of children over 6 - or over 3 - are thrown on an already hostile and overcrowded job market or whether thay will have the choice their middle-class
2
contemporaries have - to work if they choose, or stay home and take care of the youngsters, if they choose.
But the kind of politics that has done these things to us is not the kind of of politics that we must play - our politics must be differnt and new.
The kinds of politics that has been played on us must not be played by us. This doesn't mean that we must be soft or say no when we want to say yes; [it only means that other] it only means that other people's dirty tricks ] 4 are not for us.
This kind of politics we have suffered from has been the [politics] art of compromise and the art of the possible. That means that unless we compromise, everything is impossible.
Our politics has got to be a new art, the art of seeing who gets how much of what from whom.
The black and the poor are the who who haven't been getting any of anything from you know who.
Together, we have got to play this new politics for our benefit. As Congressman Clay of Missouri says so well, ""We have no permanent friends, no permanent enemies, only permanent inerests.""
Insert #1 
First of all that means wWe must divorce ourselves from the any illicit dependence on any ] 5 political partiy party. That means we must recognize that the differences between the Democrac and Republicrat parties are little enough - it is issues and interests that must motivate us.
The time has come for a politics in America that means you can vote without voting for your own enslavement, but can cast a vote - and poor people's vote, a vote that will bring you jobs, income, freedom and food, and real power in this country's decision-making process.
The immediate task of the poor American underclass right now - especially between now and November, 1972 - is to organize. When you return to your homes, spread the word that a people together are a strong people, while a people apart will stumble and fall.
Hopefully, this country will choose a new President in 1972, and you have got to be prepared to have something to say
3
about who ] 6 he or she will be.
Of course, you don't have to be involved in politics if you don't want to. If you want the people who have been running your business for 352 years to keep on doing it, they'll be glad to do it. They like doing it. They love doing it. They've gotten fat and sassy and rich doing it, while we've only gotten fa the kind of fat that comes from not eating (enough) properly?. Its now time for us to get sassy too.
We must decide now if we're
They've been doing it for so long that they think God himself ordained it in His Heaven for him them to do it. But they ought to be tired of doing it by now, so lets get together and give them some rest. After 352 years of sticking their fingers into other people's pies, here and all around the world, and pulling up all the plums for themselves, they must be tired. But tThey ought to be tired of doing it by now, so lets get together and give them some rest.
We must decide now whether y we want four more years of Nixon - Agnewism ] 7, four more years of the five-o-clock shadow and half-passed past promises, of the gate-mouthed Maryland farmer or that we whether now we're about the business of putting both of them out of business.
That choice lies in our ability to organize our [politics into poverty] poverty into politics. The best politics is always ""democratic"" politics - that's with a small ""d"". That means that our politicians must give the right to decide to each and every person. It means that we have to make our politics pay as much attention to a street light in a twenty-foot alley as it does to international complications that may turn out the lights all over' the world.

We are not here in Providence to jump on one party or to embrace another. We are not here to beg or plead, or ask for the impossible, but simply to get our thing together.
Our politics must be a politics that begins on your block, even in your kitchen. It is a politics that doesn't begin and end on election day, but starts and never ends on the kind of schedule

] 8 we were used to when we're lucky to get a job - a schedule that runs -/from can to can't.
It is a politics that you have to take into church, into your childrens school's, into everyplace you go. As you stand in line eight hours a day waiting for your check, remember waiting to see a doctor who only sees a number and who doesn't see you, stand in line waiting for powdered food you wouldn't feed your cat, remember that people you are fighting are driving to work in limosines, are eating steak and giving you bones. While you're sweating, they are swimming in their pools. If you falter and fail, remember that under Nixon, Rockefeller and Reagon you've got powdered milk for breakfast, powdered eggs for lunch, and if you're lucky, powdered potatoes for dinner.
Many of you come from states where party reform is susposed ] 9 to open at least one of the political parties to the young, the poor, to Blacks and to women. You should put this reform to a real test, to see whether that reform means you too.
Some of you come from the 20-odd states where there will be Democratic Presidential primaries next year. You ought to get together with Black politicians in these states -- the ones you help elect as well as the ones you help hope to help out of office -- to run your own candidates in these primaries next year, so that you can be represented at the 1972 conventions by someone who represents you, and not by the servants of organized labor or the hand-picked representatives of one of the Democratic candidates for President.
Many of you come from cities where the racial balance is quickly tipping in our favor. You should make sure that someone who looks like you gets a piece of the pie that others have been feeding from ] 10 for hundreds of years.
If someone tells you that these cities aren't worth running, tell him that its home to you, and you want to run your home. If someone tells you that politics is useless, tell them that's because the worng people have been using politics to use too many of us for too many years.

Last week, Vice-President Agnew suggested that some of us ought to imitate African leaders like Jomo Kenyatta. It is significant that he choose a country that fits his politics perfectly — Fascist Spain — for these remarks. Well if he wants to imitate Jomo Kenyatta, and if he wants to keep on playing ""white settler"", a lot of us are ready to begin playing Mau Mau.
None of us should believe that the future is rosy. Just this week the Census Bureau and the Department of Labor Statistics released figures demonstrating that for every three steps forward ] 11 we takem we take at least two backward. Income for Black people over the past ten years increased, their report said, but our income is still only three-fifths of what white people earn. More Black people than ever are finishing college, but we are still more likely than whites to drop out of high school. Housing for Black people has improved over the last decade, but nearly half of the rural housing for Blacks is still substandard. Life expectancy for us is still less than that for whites.
But no one has to recite these dreary figures for us. They [illegible] have been a part of daily life for too many of us for too many years.
The time is has long passed for us to take care of business, to seek political solutions to the political problems that plague us.
We might do well to remember the words of a Black Georgian, written in 1884. The man's name was T. Thomas Fortune, and he said ] 12 then:
""....the American people are fostering in their bosoms a spirit of rebellion which will yet shake the pillars of popular government as they have never before been shaken, unless a wiser policy is inaugurated and honestly enforced. All the indications point to the fulfilment of such a declaration.

ours, with ample resources to meet the actual necessities of everyone, there must be something radically wrong, not in the society but in the foundation upon which society is reared. ""
""The stretts of every city in the Union are full of people who have been made desparate.....
""The hour is fast approaching when the laboring classes of our country, North, South, East and West, will recognize they have a common cause, a common humanity, and a common enemy; and ] 13 that therefore, if they would prevail triumph over wrong and place the laurel wreath upon triumphant justice, without distinction of race or previous condition, they must unite.... When the issue is properly joine, the rich, be they Black or white, will be found on one side, and the poor, be the Black or white, will be found on the other.""*"

And you have done so in your chosen profession, the profession which deals most directly with the health problems of poor Black people.
It may be argued that jobs, housing and education are more pressing for poor Black people, but no one can argue that without good health, no one can hold a job, run a household, go to school, or function effectively in society.
That health is a pressing problem for the poor, especially for Blacks, is easily shown;
- Death comes earlier to the poor. Life expectancy for nonwhites is seven years less than for whites.
2
- Nonwhite mothers die in childbirth four times as often as do white mothers. Infant mortality is twice as high among nonwhites as among whites.
- Illness is twice as frequent among families classified as poor. Tuberculosis is found twice as frequently among nonwhite urban residents as among whites.
- Visits to doctors and dentists are less frequent among the poor, despite their obvious need for medical care.
The many federal programs, while providing help for some few, have failed to help the many. Fewer than nine million poor people are able to take advantage of Medicaid, leaving more than 30 million unable to afford medical care.
Although hunger and malnutrition are recognized as the greatest contributor to the poor health of the poor, only about 8 million poor people actually receive food assistance through food stamps and
3
distribution of commodities, and even the federally distributed commodities themselves constitute an inadequate diet.
The private and public practitioners of medicine have a real responsibility to help improve medical care. This responsibility includes locating offices accessible to the poor, it includes limiting or eliminating the high costs which deny medical care to so many.
But private efforts, despite the recent emphasis on voluntary efforts coming from Washington, will always leave a great deal to be desired. The day must come when government insures that every person has guaranteed medical and dental care, and that every person in need has a hospital bed.
That day is not likely to come any time soon, particularly if present trends continue.
The kinds of health problems which are shared by all poor people, 
4
but particularly by poor Black people, are not likely to disappear if present day contitions continue as they are.
The central facts about the failures of the American health system were spelled out two years ago in a New York Times article comparing British and American medicine:
       ""Robert Deindorfer, a New York writer, was in London with his family last summer in lower Slaughter, a Cotswold villiage. His four year old son, Scott, became seriously ill and spent three nights in a hospital, having numerous tests and intravenous feeding. Scott was in a private room, and Mr. and Mrs. Deindorfer were given a room near him. The hospital's bill at the end was $7.80 - for the parents' meals.
       That is not a a unique experience for Americans in Britain. A fair number have discovered, to their amazement, that in emergencies they can receive free hospital care under the National Health Service.
       The experience of Britons taken ill while visiting the United States is not exactly the same. A year ago, Reginald Forrester, a businessman, was rushed to a hospital in New York
5
       in desperate condition. The hospital would not admit him until it obtained a financial guarantee. He died 16 days later, and Mrs. Forrester was given a bill for $12,000.""
A great deal has been argued about this subject since then, but essentially nothing has changed.
We live in a country that has made an attempt to guarantee every citizen at least twelve years of education, but no such guarantees to health care exist.
Its cost has risen twice as fast as other costs over the past ten years. An average day in an average hospital costs more than $100, and for the first time, last year, total spending in this country on medical care exceeded the national budget for defense.
Even at that, millions do not get the care they need. A study done by National Academy of Science's Institute of Medicine estimated that infant mortality rates in New York could be cut as much as 50% simply by insuring adequate medical care to everyone.
6
The opposite side of this coin is that many suffer - improbable as it may seem - from too much care. Government statistics indicate that as many as 150,000 deaths each year are induced by doctors, and a study done at the Yale-New Haven hospital showed that 20% of the patients there were made ill by the treatment they received at the place where they'd come to get well.
There are a host of other ills particularly afflicting the poor who are both in ill health because they are poor and poor because they are in ill health.
If a solution to this crisis exists it is found in a principle successfully applied in other nations to life from the cradle to the grave: provide health care to each according to his need, and collect payment from each according to his ability to pay.
That is not likely to happen soon, either.
It is now nearly twelve months since the November day when the
7
coalition of the comfortable, the callous and the smug closed their ranks, and closed their hearts, against the claims and calls to conscience put forward by the forgotten and unrepresented elements in American society.
That rout reinstalled the fiscal fascists, the merciless merchants of the cost accounting school of social welfarism, in the White House, and insured a four year reign for men with an arrogant contempt for people and their problems.
The late American Balladeer Woodie Guthrie once said that some men kill with bullets; others with the stroke of a pen.
Coupled with an impotent Congress, the vetoes, cutbacks, shifts in sharing and reverses in revenue cut sharpest at the people at the bottom, those who look to government for help.
If the Kennedy and Johnson years taught any lesson at all, it was
8
that government, under pressure, would move, slowly and ponderously, all too often with all deliberate lack of speed - to become a partner of sorts with the American underclass in their struggle to do better for themselves. The last five years have changed all that. The government's attitude has changed from benign concern to malignant neglect.
In the decade of the sixties, the number of people living in poverty was nearly halved.
It's not unreasonable at all to ascribe some of these gains to the Great Society programs of the era.
Yet the callous castrators moved with cold calculation to kill, freeze or wind down urban renewal, model cities, community action,  public service employment, student loans, public housing, federal impact funds for education, and to impose a sixty percent national pull-back in social services.
9
Human problems are placed on a balance sheet and forced to add up: to pay for themselves. The new administrators run the programs they direct with the solicitude of a hungry mortician at an old folks home.
Some frightening figures released early this summer by the Census Bureau reveal just how poorly we are doing. On the good side, we are more likely to finish high school than ever before, more than twice as many Blacks go to college and more Black people are earning more money.
The statistical indices which reveal a worsening of the Black condition coincide almost exactly with the beginning of the Nixon presidency.
There are those who say that Black people don't mention the progress
10
we have made. These figures don't lie, but they do prove that liars figure.
We are where we are today because of a confluence of events of the sixties. The nonviolent marchers of the first part of that decade were replaced, if not in fact then certainly in the public fancy, by the rapacious rioters in the last part of the sixties.
America's cities were believed to be either in flames, under martial law, or sinking under the dead weight of a population of pensioners, the unemployed young and their presumably unemployable parents.
The rest of America was running from the city in a crisis state of their own. They rightly perceived that their taxes — higher proportionately than those payed by I T & T — were escalating to pay for barely maintaining what they had run away from, but were wrongly taught — by their President and others — that their taxes were high because of the lazy poor, and not because of the corporate evader or 
11
military glutton.
The rulers of the cities, on the other hand — the mayors, commissioners, and councilmen — faced an all too common list of plagues we have come to call the urban crisis — drug addiction, increased racial friction, civil service militancy, housing destroyed by Plan ""A"" faster than it was constructed by Plan ""B""; schools which warehoused and miseducated their students, relief rolls giving relief to no one. For them, the New Federalism promised to be manna from heaven.
It promised new money for them all, money to do what what they then could not, money to pave the streets, to pay the police, to clean the air and water.
Instead of manna and millions, it became pennies stolen from the poor, robbing Peter to pay Paul half of what Peter couldn't get by on, to begin with.
The result was to shift the burden from the federal government where
12
the resources were, to the towns and cities where the resources aren't. The municipal managers, forced to choose between funding underfunded program X or Y, chose more often than not to buy votes at the expense of the public good, with tax rebates and fancy hardware.
The administration's rhetoric about sharing the wealth became a scandalous exercise in consolidating wealth and power where they always were: away from the cities, away from children, away from people for whom health is an extra meal, and power the ability to hide from the Census taker.
The often repeated connection between today's dilemma and the end of the Reconstruction era is frightening.
The collusion between a hostile administration and a seemingly unfeeling majority, then and now, seemed to doom the hope of the American underclass.
Then and now, a President desperate for power made an arrangement, 
13
not just with the unreconstructed South, but with the national unreconstructed mentality that believes now — as it did then — that private profit and public arrogance could be pursued at the expense of the people living on the American margin.
Concurrently, the liberal crusaders for social justice and democracy became tired, or involved in other, less traumatic concerns, their outrage, guilt and indignation receding as the dark plague came closer to liberal hearth and home.
The aspirations of and movement by Black people began to be curtailed, not just by organized violence and barbarity, but by a series of nationally choreographed legal and extra-legal maneuvers designed to make us less than political and economic equals.
The frenetic activity of the sixties created a political movement characterized by selfishness and fear; a political constituency was recruited from the frightened to form solid ranks against the forgotten.
14
Backlash is too hackneyed a term for people confused by long hair and frightened by clenched fists, their politics misdirected by those who verbally oppose crime in the streets and secretly practice crime in the suites.
This manipulation of the American mind made the mundane magnificent and placed government in the hands of men who believe in privilege for the powerful and neglect of the powerless.
I can think of no better prescription for relieving the urban crisis, and reviving interest in it, than by creating a partisan national coalition of need, of mothers who want care — not warehousing — for their children, of fathers who want work at a decent wage, of people who work for a living but can't live on what they make as well as those who can't find work but can't live on what we so grudgingly give, those who want an end to welfare and capitalism for the poor and subsidy and socialism for the wealthy and who must learn that sufficiency for people 
15
at the bottom can also mean stability for those in the middle: all those people now live throughout, divided now by race and class, fearful of each other, contentious and impotent.
The task becomes one of making the Congressional elections of next year turn on commitment to the cities. The conferees gathered here come from the American metropolis, are represented in Congress — with rare exception — by men and women whose commitments are to an earlier era in American history, when farm and field were represented more than alley and expressway.
The heartening victory this summer of Tom Bradley in Los Angeles shows that a racially mixed electorate, when faced with a choice between rational planning for the future offered by one candidate and extremist charges and diversionary tactics offered by the other, will opt for reason, thought and care, and will repudiate ugliness and fear.
A few weeks ago, the strong campaign put forth by Bobby Seale in 
16
Oakland showed that more and more, voters want candidates with programs and not just promises.
Last November, while the District of Columbia and the free thinking state of Massachusetts were saving us from total embarrassment, the voters of the Fifth Congressional District of Georgia, mostly white, a combination of uneasy urbanites and satisfied suburban dwellers, chose an aggressive, young Black man for Congressman over a candidate who argued for more of the same and business as usual.
In the 1972 Congressional elections, those Americans who longed for cleaner air and water aimed their sights at members of the U.S. House who placed profits over human pleasure, and cleaned house. During most of last year, those forces in America who wanted day care legislation passed, massed their power and saw it through both houses of Congress, only to be thwarted by Presidential veto, and give up the ghost. Just this week, Atlanta, Georgia showed that it can be done.
17
Through the late sixties, a movement — lead largely by the young — made the war an issue of public consciousness, forced a sitting President to retire, and reversed the thinking of nearly one-half of the American electorate. But this task is too great for summer soldiers and single issue agitators.
There must be a confluence of all these forces from now on. But the forces that want clean air ought not support a man with a dirty heart. Those of us who applaud a Congressman who is right on peace ought not vote for him if he's wrong on pollution. If your Senator is wrong on welfare and right on rivers, make him right on welfare, too.
Building such a movement is an old and rather faded dream: its chances of success have never been easy, its difficulties have always been immense, but its urgency has never been greater.
We are lead by a government whose highest members stand accused of ""wire tapping, theft, burglary, breaking and entering, perjury, 
18
malfeasance in office, suborning testimony, bribery, forgery, obstruction of justice, various forms of conspiracy and numerous violations of campaign finance and election laws"" which were ""planned, committed, connived at, condoned or covered up as high at the top as we may dare to believe."" 1
The power which will steal the right to work form work eager mothers thinks nothing of stealing records from a doctor's office; an Attorney General who will lie under oath thinks nothing of conspiring with those who don't want Black and white kids to learn truth together; a President who harbors conspirators in his bosom readily agrees to conspire to deprive the war wounded of relief, the welfare ridden of minimal affluence, and the aged of simple security.
These men are aided by a Congress either unwilling or impotent, state legislators suddenly called upon to spend monies they haven't got for programs they didn't know existed, Mayors and city officials unable 
19
to decide whether revenue is to be shared with those who have none or those who have it all.
There exists the potential for a coalition of unusual forces, of Black and Brown people, urban white ethnics, corporate and labor leaders, people of different background, income, belief and culture, to make plans and plot strategy for making the American city a thing of beauty and a joy to live in.
But until that coalition becomes a living force at the American ballot box, its plans will be written in sand and shifted by the changing seas.
Until you can make your representative in City Hall and the County Courthouse, in the halls of Congress and the fortress of the White House, act as though they believed that you are serious about what you discuss here, then the crisis will continue to mount and every American city will move closer to becoming the urban Atticas too many of them already are. 
20
The political process is being put to a test, not as a last ditch effort, but as another weapon in an arsenal that has contained more pop guns than howitzers.
The politics of protest of the sixties found that publicly supported inequality at the lunch counter or bus station would yield — after a struggle — but the more sophisticated, institutionalized inequality of the seventies will not.
As the American city quickly becomes ""a reservation for the unwanted — most of whom are Black"" 2 it must fight back with the limited resources at its command.
Those resources are few, and amount to bodies who have votes.
Those votes — put together with the votes of those who say they care — can begin to make a dent in the reservation wall, to let money, and sunshine, and air and life inside.
11
That begins to defuse this crisis, to make a look at tomorrow more possible.
Those of you who expect your problem to be magically solved, had best take a cue from something Frederick Douglass said 100 years ago:
""He who would be free must strike the first blow. You know that liberty given is never so precious as liberty sought for and fought for. The man who is outraged is the man who must make the first outcry. Depend on it, men will not care much for a people who do not care for themselves. Men will organize to prevent cruelty to animals, for they are dumb creatures, and cannot speak for themselves, but we are men, and men must speak for themselves or we shall not be spoken for at all. We hold it self evident that no class or color should be the exclusive rulers of this country. If there is such a ruling class, there must be, of course, a subject class, and when that condition is established, the government of the people, by the people and for the people will perish from the earth.""

The choice, simply put, was between the past performance of one fallible man and the unproved promises of another.
Those who believed Gallup and Harris knew that the outcome was never in doubt.
We knew that organized labor didn’t like McGovern; that factory workers, with George Wallace gone, would go to Nixon; that the wealthy, worried about taxes, would do the same; that the middle class saw safer streets under Nixon; that the ""ethnics"" wanted to crack down on dissenters and deserters and that students could not stick to anything over a
2
prolonged period of time and that almost no one could be found, except Black people, to cast votes for George McGovern.
If the election November 7th illuminated any political movement at all, it was the movement of the comfortable, the callous and the smug closing their ranks, and their hearts, against the claims and calls to conscience put forward by the forgotten and unrepresented elements in America society.
As the Reverend Jesse JLouis Jackson has put it, ""It's not the bus - it's us"".""
There is something wrong with an election that sees one candidate receiving nearly all of the Black votes cast, and the other candidate receiving more than three-quarters of the white votes cast.
This was not simply a race between Democrats and Republicans, or even between two men named Nixon and McGovern - this was rather a national referendum on what has politely been called ""the social issue.""
For Black people in America, the election results on November 7th signaled consigning nearly all our hopes and dreams to a political
3
oblivion from which they may never emerge. It meant re-installing in power those who believe in privilege for the powerful and neglect of the powerless. It meant giving a four year free hand to the current occupants of Uncle Strom’s Cabin, a free hand to men who have demonstrated they have no concern whatsoever for freedom of the press, for the privacy of the individual, or for the constitutionally guaranteed civil rights and liberties we have all begun to believe were taken for granted by those who govern us.
The president asked for - and got - four more yrs with 2 off for good behavior.
Mr. Nixon now has four more years to put his men on the Supreme Court, to turn it back into the liberal social force it used to be or to continue its current trend toward repression.
He will continue to set the budget and name the directors of the Department of Health, Education and Welfare, the Department of Housing and Urban Development, the Department of Justice and the Federal Bureau of Intimidation.
4
He will continue to decide whether our weekly paychecks buy more or less, or whether they buy anything at all.
He has got now, in fact, three years in which to shape America to his mold, to recruit from the frightened a constituency against the forgotten, to shape the new majority into a force that will rule through fear and division.
A short while ago, the National Urban Coalition tried to spell out what was wrong in this country, and how it could be set right.
""America’s malaise,"" they said, ""--which all of us feel in one way or another -- has its roots in the distance between national ideal and national reality.""
Our ideal is a country where every American gets an equal chance to perform, where jobs exist for everyone who wants one, where health care and personal safety are assured, where we live in harmony with each other and have a decent place to live.""
5
""Our reality needs no full recital here. We know that cities are in trouble, that poverty continues in the midst of wealth, that unemployment is high, that malnutrition is widespread, that injustice exists, that tensions endure. In sum, we know that our society is not functioning the way it is supposed to.""
""But if we solve the greatest of our ills,"" the Coalition said, ""our paralysis of spirit and will, we can narrow the distance between what we have and what we want. Indeed, we must marshal our good sense and our good will. There is no sensible alternative.""
In the Coalition view ""America must pursue several major goals between now and the future."" It must try to:
""Achieve full employment with a high level of economic growth: all of our other policy goals depend upon it,
""Provide all citizens with an equal opportunity to participate in American society and in the shaping of governmental decisions affecting their lives.
6
""Guarantee that no American will go without the basic necessities: food, shelter, health care, a healthy environment, personal safety, and an adequate income.
""Meet our obligation to assist in the economic development of the world's lesser developed nations.
""These are the goals. We can move a long way toward them by 1976.""1
But in addition to the Coalition's major goals, and their definition of ""paralysis of will"" as the greatest of our ills, there is another goal much more desirable, another ill much more horrible. That ill is racism; the goal its containment and eradication.
Everyone know, or ought to know, that there is one consuming problem that makes life in New York’s Harlem, Cleveland’s Hough, Los Angeles' Watts, or Atlanta’s Vine City or any of America’s other urban Atticas where some men are held in bondage by some other men - both intolerable and insufferable.
7
That problem is race. It is race that elected our present President in 1968; race that makes some Americans serve and die more readily than others in Vietnam; race that makes some children more educated than others; race that colors all of our lives.
For the past several years, solutions to the problems of race, and therefore to the pathologies of society that spring from it, have been more than abundant.
There are several solutions that, if implemented, would begin to make this country a proper place for men and women to live and work and a healthy place for our children to play and grow and learn.
The nation could adopt, and strive for, a policy of full employment.
Equal opportunity, both racially and sexually, can stop being the rhetoric of campaigns and platforms and become the reality of the present.
8
Through public service employment, increased economic growth, increases in wage minimums and in minimum wage coverage, and in guaranteeing social insurance by radically altering public assistance, every American can be guaranteed an income.
The institution of a national health insurance program and a radical alteration of federal housing programs will additionally aid in making both urban and rural America more attractive places to live.
Of course, none of these things will ever be done, unless and until there is increased interest among the people who need and want them in replacing the new and no longer silent majority with a noisy and agitated movement of the dispossessed who will seek political solutions to their political problems.
For too many young Americans, the possibility of an exchange of Presidents meant nothing more than an exchange of photographs on the Post Office wall, or on a dormitory wall dart board.
9
For Black people, the election was a national referendum on us, of whether we would progress, run in place, or continue to slide backward as we have been doing since 1968.
Since Richard Nixon took office in 1968, we have spent billions more on war; over two million more Americans have been added to the ranks of the unemployed; six million more are on ever mounting relief rolls, inflation has reduced our standard of living, and elitist, sexist and racist practices run rampant, unchecked through public and private American life.
These practices will not be ended by some cataclysmic revolution anytime soon - they can be ended by hard work and by concerted political and social action.
That has been the history of Black people's lives in America - constant pressure - with or without allies - aimed at improving our position.
What has happened in the United States since the first Black
10
people set foot here in 1619 is that everything has changed and nothing has changed, particularly for us in the South.
For one, we are no longer slaves. Secondly, we can sit at lunch counters, sit downstairs at movie theatres, ride in the front of buses, register and vote where we once could not.
But in a great many ways, we are constantly discovering that things have either not changed at all, or have become much worse.
A quick look at all of the facts and figures that measure how well, or how poorly, a people are doing - the kinds of statistics that measure infant mortality, unemployment, median family income, life expectancy - demonstrates clearly that the average Black American, while better off than his father was, is actually worse off when his statistics are measured against similar ones for white people.
It is as though Black Americans are climbing a molasses mountain in snowshoes, while white people are riding a ski lift to the top.
It is these depressing figures, and the accompanying pathology which results from them, that causes so much discontent and depression
11
in Black communities today.
The realization is that over the years the diverse strategies of Booker T. Washington and Dr. W. E. B. DuBois and Marcus Garvey and Martin Luther King and Malcolm X have not separately improved the material lot of the masses of Black folk, but their apparent failure has convinced many Black people that such progress will never occur.
The separate agitations these philosophies gave birth to - either a return to mother Africa, struggle in the courts, a nonviolent thrust into the streets, a violent attempt at doing real injury to white America - all these have accustomed many white people to believe that Black people have by now got everything we want, and half of what white folks have, too.
But the problem so often referred to as America’s Black problem - in reality a massive white problem - continues. It continues despite wars on poverty and Great Societies and New Frontiers and will continue despite the New Federalism.
12
The roots of the problem are deep in the fabric of this country, and began with the rape of Africa, the stealing of child from mother, the separation of husband from wife, the destruction of various cultures and religions, the displacement of a whole people from their land and their country.
They involve the basest of prejudices, an economic system that has always believed property was more important than people - the results have been to place and keep Black people at the bottom of the ladder that in this nation is supposed to lead to jobs and homes and education and security.
It has made us the last to be hired and the first to be fired; it has recently, as any reading of Vietnam casualty lists will show, made our young men first in war, last in peace, and seldom in the hearts of our countrymen. It has given Black children an opportunity to attend school for twelve years while receiving only six years of education. It has placed us on relief to where we are called lazy
13
and shiftless while 6,000 white American farmers are paid $25,000 each a year not to work, and while oil millionaires receive an automatic 27-1/2% tax write off every year.
In short, we are in bad shape. The gains made yesterday are vanishing today. The victories won in the wars of 1954 and 1960 are being negated by the winner of the battle of '68 and the rout of '72.
The question remains for the future - will it happen again?
[Long hashmarks handwritten between these two paragraphs.]
What is happening now happened once before in American history in the years after Reconstruction. In both cases, a President made a cynical deal, not just with the unreconstructed South, but with the national unreconstructed mentality that believed then as it believes now, that the American social agenda must not include those at the bottom of the ladder.
The promises made then that Black people would be included in the social and economic life of the nation were repudiated. Instead of fulfilling the dream, then as now:
14
The liberal crusaders for social justice and democracy became weary and involved in other concerns as Black people and our problems could no longer be considered a purely Southern phenomenon;
The aspirations for and movement of Blacks began to be curtailed by organized violence and barbarity and by a series of legal and extra-legal maneuvers designed to make us less than political and economic equals;
The hopes and belief of Black people that racial equality and social justice could be achieved through litigation, legislation, negotiation, occasional direct action and strong alliances with white liberal groups were supplanted by disillusionment, bitterness, and open anger;
The guilt and indignation of Northern supporters of the Southern drive for equality turned into an attitude of first cautious - and now open - facism hostility when the Northern Black man began to take seriously the
15
claims of progress and began to look for visible signs in northern cities.2
Reversing this recession of political concern ought to be part of your agenda for the remainder of the seventies.
To mount a serious struggle against the arrogant power that runs from the White House to the corporate board room to the City Hall and County Courthouse requires more than the partial presence of summer soldiers and occational agitators.
Among other things, it requires the building of an aggressive, militant democratic (with a small ""d"") political movement, based in Black America, in coordination with others who are nonwhite and poor, in open ended coalition with all those others in this country who are tired of crime in the streets and crime in the suites, who want an end to welfare and capitalism for the poor and subsidy and socialism for the wealthy, who insist that Vietnam was no aberration but a calculated result of a bankrupt foreign policy, people who work for a living and
16
can't live on what they make and people who can't find work and can't make it on what we so graciously give, these and others could, if they voted together or marched together or even shouted or jumped up and down together, begin to build a force powerful enough to take control in a peaceful, orderly fashion, or by following the example of those now exercising great power.
The process begins by re-defining what politics is, or rather, ought to be.
It ought not be the art of the possible, and ought not be the art of compromise, but ought to be defined as a new, more exciting, and more exacting art, the art of seeing who gets how much of what from whom.
People who have been powerless for so long must never be naive about the political process: it guaranteed no instant equality for the other ethnic Americans of an earlier century, and it will do no more for us.
It is important not in the abstract, putting Black people in
17
positions of prominence without power is useless - we have been taken by tokens too often.
What is important is having something to say about what is being done to and for you: that is what success at the art will bring.
The American political process has been cyclical for Blacks, a series of ups and downs.
Its history is generally a negative one, a history of Blacks, proposing and whites disposing, a history with only one bright moment, the ten years of Reconstruction, the only ten years in American history when democracy began to mean as much in Mississippi as it always has meant in Maine, the only ten years in which an aggressive national government acted with armed might to protect the civil and political rights of Black people.
From the closing of that period of hope just before the beginning of the twentieth century: the century whose problem, Dr. W. E. B. DuBois
18
said, would be ""the problem of the color line"" to this point just past the middle of the twentieth, Black Americans have seen our political fortunes ebb and rise and now, ebb again.
From the days when Frederick Douglass said ""The Republican party is the ship: all else is the sea"" to the days of Franklin Delano Roosevelt, Black people have tried first one, and now the other, national political party.
We have been ill served by politicians whom the late Ralph McGill once called ""so grotesque it seems impossible they could have been influential.""
Instead, a new crop of national political leaders has begun the task the white South once believed was theirs alone: deciding on the proper political, educational, and economic position for the region's Black people.
These people march backward like an offkey Salvation Army Band,
19
going into the world to convert the saved into sinners.
The new group was made of some old faces: a President who rose from the dead, a Southern Senator who has belonged to three political parties, and a former Attorney General who surely must be the first man to hold his job in recent years who can receive a standing ovation from white Mississippians.
As that first Reconstruction ended with a deal made in a hotel room, this second once ended that way too: a deal made in a hotel in Miami Beach in 1968 that gave the white South veto power over Supreme Court nominees, gave the white South hope that the drive to register Black voters would stop, gave the white South hope that the slow pace of school integration would move even slower, and breathed new life into the national mood of resistance to progress for Black people.
The task of beginning again cannot be done by Black people alone, and certainly cannot be done by people who measure their social relevance by the length of their hair or the intricacy of their
20
handshake. College campuses used to be centers for movement and social protest: today, they are havens for the Boogaloo, Bid Whist, and Boone’s Farm. A great deal of today's long hair seems to be camouflage for yesterday's red necks.
It was frightening in 1972 to hear those who hid in the sometime safety and temporary sanctuary of the college campus call for the election of George Wallace as a means of ""heightening the contradictions"" and thereby hastening the revolution. That's quite fine in infantile campus revolutionary theory, but it's Black peoples' contradictions that are being hastened, not theirs.
It is disturbing when people who could spend their time registering voters or organizing the unorganized spend their time in esoteric debate about the relative revisionism of the late Ho Chi Minh.
There is a rather large job to be done.
It may well succeed, but it cannot be attempted by people who
21
think they can smoke America to her knees.
Even now, as the Congress of the United States daily demonstrates it is either unable, unwilling or impotent in the face of the Presidential emasculation of the best of the Kennedy and Johnson years, the battle comes home.
A peace of sorts has come to part of Southeast Asia: the fight for peace must now come home.
Winning this peace means finding the answer to the divisions that make the poor contentious and divided against themselves; that make a steel worker blame a Black man for unemployment; that makes new allies out of ancient enemies and stronger friends from historical sufferers.
That is the task.
It might take as its watchword some words from the past, from Dr. DuBois, who said almost 70 years ago:
""
22
""I believe in God who made of one blood all races that dwell on earth. I believe that all men, Black and Brown, and white, are brothers, varying, through time and opportunity, in form and gift and feature, but differing in no essential particular, and alike in soul and in the possibility of infinite development.
Especially do I believe in the Negro race; in the beauty of its genius, the sweetness of its soul, and its strength in that meekness which shall inherit this turbulent earth.
I believe in the Prince of Peace. I believe that war is murder. I believe that armies and navies are at bottom the tinsel and braggadocio of oppression and wrong; and I believe that the wicked conquest of weaker and darker nations by nations white and stronger but foreshadows the death of that strength.
I believe in liberty for all men; the space to stretch their arms and their souls; the right to breathe and the right to vote,
23
the freedom to choose their friends, enjoy the sunshine and ride on the railroads, uncursed by color; thinking, dreaming, working as they will in a kingdom of God and love.
I believe in the training of children Black even as white; the leading out of little souls into the green pastures and beside the still waters, not for pelf or peace, but for life lit by some large vision of beauty and goodness and truth; lest we forget, and the sons of the fathers, like Esau, for mere meat barter their birthright in a mighty nation.
Finally, I believe in patience - patience with the weakness of the weak and the strength of the strong, the prejudice of the ignorant and the ignorance of the blind; patience with the tardy triumph of joy and the mad chastening of sorrow - patience with God."""

One man was President of the United States; now he has impeached and pardoned himself, has gone into retirement on San Clemente's sunny shores, discredited as a tax cheat, a liar and a petty thief, excused from punishment for commiting crimes that have filled our jails with men and women not fortunate to be born rich or white or to have been elected to high office.
His successor, a man Lyndon Johnson once said ""couldn't walk and chew gum at the same time"", has apparently started chewing gum again.
All around the rest of the globe great changes are taking place. 
In Africa, the people of Mozambique and Guinea-Bissau are reaching freedom and self determination.
The North Vietnamese are consolidating their earlier victory over American military might and will soon exercise democratic control over their entire nation.
2
In Europe, in Latin America, the struggle for justice and right against oppression and wrong goes on.
Only in America is there hesitation and faltering, uncertainty and indecision. Only here do popular movements among the oppressed rise and fall as regularly as the phases of the moon.
These conditions under which we struggle do not exist in a vacuum; they are part and parcel of a larger picture of powerful forces determined to maintain the status quo.
What has happened is this: the reigns of government have been seized by a massive coalition of the comfortable, the callous and the smug who have closed their minds and hearts to the claims and calls to conscience put forward by the forgotten and unrepresented elements in American society.
This has resulted in the national nullification of the needs of the needy, the gratituitous gratification of the gross and the greedy, a triumph for the politics of penuriousness, prevarication and impropriety, of pious platitudes and self righteous swinishness.
3
We have become the constant victims of a national coalition.
Two elections gave them awesome power, the second, a rout that reinstalled the fiscal fascists, the merciless merchants of the cost accounting school of social welfarism in the White House, and insured a four year reign for men with an arrogant contempt for people and their problems.
The late American balladeer Woodie Guthrie once said that some men kill with bullets; others with the stroke of a pen.
Coupled with an impotent Congress, the vetoes, cut-backs, shifts in sharing and reverses in revenue cut sharpest at the people at the bottom, those who look to government for help.
But if the Kennedy and Johnson years taught any lesson at all, it was that government, under pressure, would move, slowly and ponderously, all too often with all deliberate lack of speed, to become a partner of sorts with the American underclass in their struggle to do better for themselves. The last few years have changed all that. The government's attitude changed from benign concern to malignant neglect.
In the decade of the sixties, the number of people living in
4
poverty was reduced by nearly one-third.
It's not unreasonable at all to ascribe some of these gains to the great society programs of the era.
Yet the cruel and callous castrators moved with cold calculation to kill, freeze or wind down urban renewal, model cities, community action, public service employment, student loans, public housing, federal impact funds for education, and to impose a sixty percent national pull back in social services.
Human problems are now placed on a balance sheet and forced to add up, to pay for themselves. The new administrators run the programs they direct with the solicitude of a mortician at an old folks home.
While the nation waltzed into the seventies believing that its Black problem had been blown or burned away, infant mortality rates for us remained twice as high as for everyone else; nearly half of all Black families in the United States earned less than $5000 a year; the average Black American was dying seven years earlier than his white counterpart; we remained last hired and first fired.
5
We are where we are today because of a confluence of events of the sixties. The nonviolent marchers of the first part of that decade were replaced, if not in fact then certainly in the public fancy, by the rapacious rioters in the last part of the sixties.
America's cities were believed to be either in flames, under marital law, or sinking under the dead weight of a population of pensioners, the unemployed young and their presumably unemployable parents.
The rest of America was running from social concerns in a crisis state of their own. They rightly perceived that their taxes - higher proportionately than those paid by I.T.&T. - were escalating to pay for barely maintaining what they had run away from, but were wrongly taught, by their president and others, that their taxes were high because of the lazy poor, and not because of the corporate evader or the military glutton.
The rulers of the cities, on the other hand - the mayors, commissioners and councilmen - faced an all too common list of plagues we have come to call the urban crisis: drug addiction, increased racial friction, civil service militancy, housing destroyed by Plan ""A"" faster than it was
6
constructed by Plan ""B""; schools which warehoused and mis-educated their students, relief rolls giving relief to no one. For them the new federalism promised to be manna from heaven.
It promised new money for them all, money to do what they then could not, money to pave the streets, to pay the police, to clean the air and water.
Instead of manna and millions, it became pennies stolen from the poor, robbing Peter to pay Paul half of what Peter couldn't get by on to begin with.
The result was to shift the burden from the federal government where the resources were to the towns and cities where the resources aren't.
The administration's rhetoric about sharing the wealth became a scandalous exercise in consolidating wealth and power where they always were: away from the cities, away from the children, away from people for whom wealth is an extra meal, and power the ability to hide from the census taker.
The often repeated connection between today's dilemma and the end
7
of the Reconstruction Era is frightening.
The collusion between a hostile administration and a seemingly unfeeling majority, then and now, seemed to doom the hope of the American underclass.
Then and now, a president desperate for power made an arrangement. Not just with the unreconstructed South, but with the national unreconstructed mentality that believes now - as it did then - that private profit and public arrogance could be pursued at the expense of the people living on the American margin.
Concurrently, the liberal crusaders for social justice and democracy became tired, or involved in other, less traumatic concerns. For many of them, picking up beer cans by the side of the highway became an acceptable substitute to winning jobs in the brewery for Black people.
The aspirations of and movement by Black people began to be curtailed, not just by organized violence and barbarity, but by a series of nationally choreographed legal and extralegal maneuvers designed to make us less than political and economic equals.
8
The frenetic activity of the sixties created a political movement characterized by selfishness and fear; a political constituency was recruited from the frightened to form solid ranks against the forgotten.
Backlash is too hackneyed a term for people confused by long hair and frightened by clenched fists, their politics misdirected by those who verbally oppose crime in the streets and secretly practice crime in the suites.
This manipulation of the American mind made the mundane magnificent and placed government in the hands of men who believe in privilege for the powerful and neglect of the powerless.
I can think of no better prescription for relieving this crisis, and reviving interest in it, than by creating a partisan national coalition of need, of mothers who want care, not warehousing, for their children, of fathers who want work at a decent wage, of people who work for a living but can't live on what they make as well as those who can't find work but can't live on what we so grudgingly give, those who want an end to welfare and capitalism for the poor and subsidy and socialism for the wealthy and
9
who must learn that sufficiency for people at the bottom can also mean stability for those in the middle; all those people now live in America, divided now by race and class, fearful of each other, contentious and impotent.
We have just gone through the every-two-year occasion in America when the people, acting in concert, through the electoral process, are supposed to set their sights on common goals shared and held by us all.
Instead, we saw an election where fewer participated than ever before; where the issues became age and incumbency and allegiance to fallen idols, or contests between the demonstrated failures of one set of hopefuls and the unproved promises of another; nowhere was their commitment to radical social and economic change of the sort needed to lift the underclass to simple survival level.
An entire political movement came to near maturity in America in the sixties. Fueled by the fire from the Southern Civil Rights movement, it threatened to challenge the foundations of monopoly capital, of skin privilege, of the radical arrogance that created vast reservations of the
10
unwanted on this country's soil.
That movement became the victim of its own successes. It fought and won the right to sit in the front of the bus, to cast a vote, to sit at a lunch counter. But it failed to sustain that movement, and instead saw it dissipated in the struggles on the edge.
Being Black became a rhetorical or sartorial accomplishment. Social commitment began to be measured by the length of your hair or the intricacy of your handshake.
Those young people who some years ago were marching militantly in the streets are now found running nude on the college campus, demonstrating that all men are not created equal.
The political process ought to be put to a year round test, not as a last ditch effort, but as another weapon in an arsenal that has contained more pop guns than Howitzers.
The politics of street protest of the Sixties found that publicly supported inequality at the lunch counter or bus station would yield, after a struggle, but the more sophisticated, institutionalized inequality
11
of the seventies will not.
As America quickly becomes divided into free zones and reservations for the unwanted, it must fight back with the limited resources at its command. Those of you who decide to undertake such a task might be strengthened by some words from the past, from W.E.B. DuBois, who said: ""I believe in God who made of one blood all races that dwell on earth. I believe that all men, Black and brown, and white, are brothers, varying, through time and opportunity, in form and gift and feature, but differing in no essential particular, and alike in soul and in the possibility of infinite development.
Especially do I believe in the Negro race; in the beauty of its genius, the sweetness of its soul, and its strength in that meekness which shall inherit this turbulent earth.
I believe in pride of race and lineage itself; in pride of self so deep as to scorn injustice to other selves; in pride of lineage so great as to despise no man's father; in pride of race so chivalrous as neither to offer bastardy to the weak nor beg wedlock of the strong, knowing that
12
men may be brothers in Christ, even though they be no brothers-in-law.
I believe in service: humble reverent service, from the blackening of boots to the whitening of souls; for work is heaven, idleness hell, and wages is the ""well done"" of the master who summoned all them that labor and are heavy laden, making no distinction between the Black sweating cotton-hands of Georgia and the first families of Virginia, since all distinction not based on deed is devilish and not divine.
I believe in the devil and his angels, who wantonly work to narrow the opportunity of struggling human beings, especially if they be Black; who spit in the faces of the fallen, strike them that cannot strike again, believe the wors and work to prove it, hating the image which their maker stamped on a brother's soul.
I believe in the Prince of Peace. I believe that war is murder. I believe that armies and navies are at bottom the tinsel and braggadocio of oppression and wrong; and I believe that the wicked conquest of weaker and darker nations by nations white and stronger but foreshadows the death of that strength.
13
I believe in liberty for all men; the space to stretch their arms and their souls; the right to breathe and the right to vote; the freedom to choose their friends, enjoy the sunshine and ride on the railroads, uncursed by color; thinking, dreaming, working as they will in a kingdom of God and love.
I believe in the training of children Black even as white; the leading out of little souls into the green pastures and beside the still waters, not for pelf truth; lest we forget, and the sons of the fathers, like Esau, for mere meat barter their birthright in a mighty nation.
Finally, I believe in patience: patience with the weakness of the weak and the strength of the strong, the prejudice of the ignorant and the ignorance of the blind; patience with the tardy triumph of joy and the chastening of sorrow: patience with God.""

This was my third trip to what used to be called the dark continent. It was called that both because of the color of its people and also because it was mysterious and dark, populated by different tribes who speak in different tongues and who worship different gods.
Africa's map today is a crazy quilt of colors representing countries drawn by European hands, respecting no real boundary of region or geography, representing, instead the avariciousness of the colonial powers.
The old saying was never more true: ""When the European came, he had the bible and we had the land--then we had the bible and he had the land.""
He also had cheap--if not free--labor and an unequaled storehouse of wealth-- gold, oil, diamonds, food and fiber, minerals galore.
Today that map is changing fast. Portugal became the last European colony to surrender to the inevitable, and now only three parts of the continent remain under racist rule.
At their core is South Africa.
It is difficult to discuss South Africa with Americans who are used to living in a country where civil rights are more or less guaranteed.
2
Imagine if you will, that the United States was South Africa and white was black:
The black population, 10 to 12% of the total, were the only citizens allowed to vote and own property;
That the majority, the 90% of the population that was white, was forced to live on 13% of the land;
That black children were educated freely, by the state, but that white children had to pay to go to public schools;
- that no white worker could supervise a black one;
- that no white worker could belong to a labor union, although black workers could;
- that no white person--except the occasional household servant living in a detached servant's home near his or her master's residence--could live in Nashville but instead had to commute daily, by train, to work here;
- that white people who had lived in Tennessee for three generations were suddenly resettled to an arid corner of Texas because their great-grandparents had lived there, even though the new immigrants never had, could not speak the language, and had no desire to move;
- that every white citizen had to always carry a passport, granting him permission to be in Chattanooga or Memphis or Knoxville or Atlanta, and that he could be sent to jail for not having it;
- that any person, white or black, could be sent to jail without notice or trial for 120 days, and for another 120 days beyond that, and 120 days more and more, ad infinitum;
3
- that any citizen could by government edict become a non-person, his friends forbidden to speak to or visit with him, newspapers forbidden to print his name or record or report his words;
- that 10,000 white children, high school age and younger, had marched peacefully through downtown Nashville, and the city police has opened fire on them, killing 353, wounding more than a thousand;
- that a family of white mourners had been machine-gunned into their mourned one's grave;
- that whites and blacks who opposed the government's policy were forbidden to travel to Mexico or Canada;
- that our president, attorney general and other cabinet members had collaborated with the Nazis during the second world war--
If you can imagine that, then you have a mirror image of life in the Republic of South Africa today.
Imagine further that the minority population of the country enjoys the highest standard of living on the continent, a standard built on the bloody backs of the majority.
For those of us in this country who seldom pay much attention to what happens in the next block, let alone the next state, these facts may seem unfortunate, to be sure, but none of our business.
But it is precisely our businesses which keep them afloat, which prop up an economy and a society which constitutes an affront to all decent thinking people everywhere.
4
350 U.S. corporations have subsidiaries in the republic of South Africa, including General Motors, Ford, Chrysler, Mobile Oil, Firestone, Goodyear, Union Carbide, Minnesota Mining and Manufacturing, and I.B.M.
By bolstering the South African economy, and by adhering to its policies of apartheid, these American businesses stand hand in hand with the most hateful political system on earth.
Having visited that section of the world, I can report that no effort for peaceful change will be successful. Only a combination of external and internal pressures, including violence, can hope to alter that situation from what it is today.
For we Americans, it is a situation fraught with danger. We already stand condemned by much of Black Africa for our untimely and illicit entry into the Angolan Civil War.
Because our foreign policy has always been dominated by the cold war, and because the Soviet Union and the people's Republic of China have generally supported the liberation movements while we always support the oppressors, our every move in Africa is suspect.
The election of Jimmy Carter and the participation of black Americans in that victory, both as active early supporters as was Ambassador Andrew Young, and as voters for Carter, as was nine of every ten black voters on November 2nd, 1976 had raised expectations high in Africa.
Black Americans have long been chided by Africans for not becoming the kind of domestic lobby for them that American Jews are for Israel.
5
The Carter Administration is being looked to for tough action against minority rule in Southern Africa, and if it does not develop, then our position as a moral leader will be further eroded.
The United States is now faced with a critical test of its intentions in Southern Africa.
Powerful forces here and in Great Britain are pushing hard for at least tacit endorsement of the internal settlement pending between the illegal government of Ian Smith and moderate African forces in Zimbabwe.
The settlement is suspect because:
- it does not include the fighting forces that brought the Smith government to its knees and the bargaining table;
- the illegal, white regime does not surrender power;
- it entrenches while privilege.
Caught between courting conservatives for support on the Panama Canal Treaty at home and the rising tide of racism in Great Britain, there is great pressure on the Carter Administration to give in to this jerry-built agreement.
That is why we must become an informed, articulate and aggressive Force for change in Southern Africa, for the dismatling of racism, for the beginning of a better, brighter day.
Africa is my roots. My ancestors came from the West Coast of Africa.
Every black American has a stake in the Continent, a birthright stake as well as a history of our own involvement in the 200 year old American struggle to make democracy real.
6
The cancer on the African continent is South Africa; the sooner it's arrested and cured, the healthier we all will be.
A minimal policy in Southern Africa would include the following:
- the passage of legislation by congress requiring American firms doing business in South Africa--and elsewhere--to obey pertinent American law on hiring and promotion and wage rates. Presently South African Blacks earn less than one-sixteenth the wages of their white counterparts, are forbidden to supervise or direct white workers- and are denied jobs officially reserved for whites.
- strong support for the United Nations arms embargo against South Africa and sanctions against those--including our allies--who break it.
- the withholding of visa privileges to white South Africans until the pretoria Government grants the right of travel to all Americans, and not a selected few.
- increased educational aid to independent states bordering on South Africa so that student refugees and exiles can continue their training.
Continued opposition to recognition of the South African Bantustans.
- the immediate withdrawal of American military attaches from South Africa.
The south Africans are here in Nashville because no one else will have them.
We must let them know by word and deed that we will not tolerate this cancer in our midst, these representatives of a fascist state, a government lead by Nazi collaborators, the most racially oppressive govern-
7
ment on earth.
The Davis Cup matches are more than a 78-year-Old international competition. The very presence here of an all white-and-a-half team from South Africa is an insult to all of the people of the United States.
These games are apartheid exported, an attempt to gain acceptance in the civilized world.
If they proceed without protest, by your silence you give assent to a system rejected by world opinion and repudiated by democratic governments everywhere.
Out of 500,000 participants in organized sports in the whole of South Africa, only 56 players are in integrated athletic events.
In the Republic of South Africa, 4.4 million whites received $1.9 million in sports subsidies; 18.5 million blacks got $50,000.00
Change in south africa has always come from outside pressure.
After south africa was expelled from the olympics, permission was granted for integrated teams to play overseas.
In 1974, mixed competition was allowed in national events.
After the revolt in Soweto in 1976, multi-national competition was approved.
Each half-step forward came only after external pressure and internal disruption.
In spite of the hard lives Black Americans have, there is nothing in our 20th century experience to match the current situation in Namibia today.
8
There are those in America so naieve as to believe that South Africa today is like the American South ten years ago.
But Birmingham was never Johannesburg. Bull Corner's men opened fire with hoses, not machine guns.
The American system recognized American Blacks as paper citizens at least, while in South Africa, only white can be right.
The American Black population still has many problems all its own.
We are still last hired, first fired. We are still last in, first out. We are still poor all out of proportion to our numbers, powerless despite our ability to elect presidents, hungry in spite of integrated lunch counters, ignorant in spite of integrated schools.
We are only a few years freed from the American version of petty apartheid, the Jim Crow bus, the black and white drinking water, the segregated drive-in movie.
Only in our treatment of our Native American population, its forced resettlement and in the genocide practiced against them can an American parallel be found.
In spite of progress won at great cost, racism remains the single unifying theme among the American white population, divided as they may be by religion, class, politics and geography.
As in South Africa, racism makes good sense for some people here too.
The Equal Opportunity Employment Commission, for example, reported
9
that A.T.& T. ""saved"" its stockholders a staggering $363 million dollars a year by paying its black and female employees what they would have received if they were male and pale.
There really is such a thing as reverse discrimination - it is discrimination in favor of whites, the continuation of a 200 year old sexually and racially motivated quota system in which less qualified whites are given an unfair advantage in jobs, wages and promotions which many could not have and would not deserve it they had to compete fairly with blacks.
If this is a government as good as our people, then either the people or our government - or both - are stingy, mean-spirited, and callous.
Given the choice between spending more and taxing less, Carter and company have chosen the latter, with dire consequences for those who hoped for federal assistance to solve the great human problems of our times.
Even the loud debate about the three-martini lunch has been resolved against the tax-payer, who will continue to subsidize a daily martini-and-a-half.
The Humphrey Hawkins Bill has been changed from federal job guarantees to a set of paper promises to reduce unemployment to a rate which will institutionalize permanent joblessness for 11% of the Black labor force.
Life is indeed unfair in 1978 if you are poor and non-white, if
10
you are poor and pregnant, or if you are simply poor. Having had our expectations raised, we now discover them dashed, battered and beaten by business as usual.
We are already two years into our third century as an organized people, and discovering that this third hundred years may not be much different form the two that went before.
Those first two centuries saw great advances in human liberty and technology, but little appreciable change in the relationship between those who have and those who don't.
No where is this more clear than among those whose lives are colored by race, the 23 million Americans of Africa descent.
Twice as many of this group are jobless now as in 1968, ten long years ago. 100,000 of this groups have lost jobs since Jimmy Carter took office.
Black Americans are roughly 11% of the American population, roughly 23 million people. 13 million of us - more than half - live in America’s cities.
Our numbers have doubled since 1940. Although the black birth rate is in decline, we still increase at a faster rate than whites. 53% of us still live in states of the Old Confederacy, although one and a half million migrated away since 1960.
11
Life expectancy for us has doubled in the 20th century, although a Black boy born in 1974 will still live six years less than a white boy born that same year, and black men somehow lost a year of expectable life in the ten years between 1960 and 1970.
Our infant and maternal death rates decline each year, but three black women still die in childbirth for every white one.
Our median income has increased to 65% of what whites will earn, but 1/3 of all Blacks still stand under the poverty line while only one of every 10 whites stands in the same low spot.
These depressing figures are important for us all, for they reflect and record American unwillingness to pay the inconvenience costs of fulfilling the American dream.
They demonstrate why our cities are in decay, our prisons over-crowded, our welfare system at financial and moral bankruptcy, our political institutions paralyzed and impotent.
A clearly defined 10% of the whole has been condemned to the status of a permanent underclass, doomed to never stand shoulder to shoulder with their country women and men.
So far this centruy, the life chances of this group of Americans have improved only when everyone else steps up the ladder too -- this group then has a larger stake in achieving economic democracy than the majority of those with whom they live.
12
During the decade of the 1950's, a great social movement fought to win a place at the table for those citizens previously consigned to eating in the kitchen, if they ate at all.
Now that the legal and extralegal barriers have been largely removed, the battle for the remainder of the twentieth century is to close this widening gap.
None of us has much difficulty envisioning the world we want or the programs, which if adopted would ring the new dawn in.
We want a society whose single aim is the democratic satisfaction of the needs of its people.
We want to guarantee all Americans an equal opportunity to participate in the organization of society, and in the shaping of public and private decisions which affect their lives.
We want to guarantee that no one goes without the basic necessities - food, shelter, health care, a healthy environment, personal safety and an adequate income.
Instead, the hopes and dreams of generations that each succeeding year would be the year in which the land of the slave finally becomes the home of the free have been set aside in favor of balanced budgets and corporate domination of the economy. 
In spite of the progress made so far, the real problem remains to be solved, the problem Dr. W.E B. DuBois called ""the greater problem, which obscures the basic one, the problem of the color line, is the fact that so many civilized persons are willing to live in comfort, even when the price of this is the poverty, disease and ignorance of the majority of their fellow men.""*
13
What we need to be about in 1978 - and for many, many years to come is a version of politics which cannot be labeled by the old terms.
If there is an opening for an American era of politics different from the past, then it must be a citizen's democracy, insurgent, but with its focus aimed seriously at power.
When I speak here of ""democratic"" I do not mean the political party now in power, but rather the system of equally distributing wealth and power in an organized society, through institutions bases on the premise that we all have equal ability - and equal right - to make decisions about our lives and our future.
This will require the creation of a large cadre with the strategy, skill and vision to build a democratic movement in the mainstream - a reassertion of the plain truth that ordinary women and men have the common sense and ability to control their lives, given the knowledge and the means.
The instruments involved in building such a movement are more than electoral races, as important as they may be. The lessons we ought to have learned form the sixties is this: mass movement must have an organized base; without organizations that are stable, continuous, and mass based, the movements that do emerge eventually flounder and decay; the sixties, in retrospect, were merely a series of mass mobilizations, winning some impressive victories and inspiring great expectations, but ultimately unable to sustain a living democracy at the base of society.
14
We must develop a political program broad enough to attract a large section of the population, real enough to have some expectation of implementation, and human enough to solve the problems which most Americans have in some measure.
That program must have a foreign policy, and freedom for southern Africa must be its root.
These two struggles are closely related, however different the circumstances may be.
There is inseparable connection between Black Africa and Black America.
We are the same people, fighting the same enemy in the same way.
And the enemy reacts as if he were one.
He blames Communists, when people simply want to vote.
He blames outside agitators, when children simply want to learn.
He points the finger at others when the world's eyes are fixed on him.
He talks about Idi Amin, and Marxist dictatorships, as though their wrongs made his wrong right.
Much more is at issue here than whether white or black men hit a small white ball across a net.
15
You who join these portests are fighting against racism in its rawest form, here and abroad.
You are fighting against the economic exploitation of a whole people, exploitation strongly supported by the same people who do business here with you.
You are fighting against a system of political tyranny unmatched since the Third Reich, a system with no notion of the ordinary rights of free men and women we all hold dear.
You fight a system where father and family are separated, where children pay to go to public schools, where the races are identified with Hitlerian precision, where white is might and right.
You are fighting finally for yourselves, for the right to hold your head high when your children's children ask what you did when the South African question was raised.
We are living in a time of great change.
Half a century ago, W E.B. DuBois predicted that ""the problem of the 20th century would be the problem of the color line.""
That prediction has come true here and in Africa, where the last strong holds of prejudice are slowly surrendering.
There is turmoil all over the globe and the central issue in these
16
conflicts is the relationship between the governed and their government.
That conflict resulted in two great wars here, in 1776 and in 1865.
In Africa, men and women fight and die today to insure they will have a say in determining their lives and their future.
We can do no less.

A
While the nation waltzed into the 70s believing that its Black problem had been blown or burned away: 

infant mortality rates for us remained twice as high as for everyone else; 

nearly half of all Black families in the United States earned less than $5000 a year; 


the average Black American was dying 7 years earlier than his white counterpart; 

we remained last hired and first fired. 

1
Events have moved so quickly in the last few days and weeks that we must be careful not to let them sweep us away. 
One man was President of the United States; now he has impeached himself, has gone into retirement on San Clemente’s sunny shores, discredited as a tax cheat, a liar and a petty thief, and now he has been excused from punishment for committing crimes that have filled our jails with men and women not fortunate to be born rich or white or to have been elected to high office. 
His successor - a man Lyndon Johnson once said “couldn’t walk and chew gum at the same time” - has apparently started chewing gum again.
2 
All around the globe great changes are taking place. 
In Africa, the people of Mozambique and Guinea-Bissau are reaching freedom and self determination. 
The heroic North Vietnamese are consolidating their earlier victory over American military might and will soon exercise democratic control over their entire nation. 
In Europe - in Latin America - the struggle for justice and right against oppression and wrong goes on. 
Only in America is there hesitation and faltering, uncertainty and indecision.
Only here do popular movements among the oppressed rise and fall as regularly as the phases of the moon. 
3
These conditions under which we struggle do not exist in a vacuum; they are part and parcel of a larger picture of powerful forces determined to maintain the status quo. 
What has happened is this: the reins of government have been seized by a massive coalition of the comfortable, the callous and the smug who’ve closed their minds and hearts to the claims and calls to conscience put forward by the forgotten and unrepresented elements in American society. 
This has resulted in the national nullification of the needs of the needy, the gratuitous gratification of the gross and the greedy, a triumph for the politics of penuriousness, prevarication, and impropriety, of pious platitudes and self righteous swinishness. 
4 
Two elections gave them awesome power, the second, a rout that reinstalled the fiscal fascists, the merciless merchants of the cost accounting school of social welfarism in the White House, and insured a four year reign for men with an arrogant contempt for people and their problems. 
The late American balladeer Woodie Guthrie once said that some men kill with bullets; others with the stroke of a pen. 
Coupled with an impotent Congress, the vetoes, cut-backs, shifts in sharing and reverses in revenue cut sharpest at the people at the bottom, those who look to government for help. 
If the Kennedy and Johnson years taught me any lessons at all, it 
5
was that government, under pressure, would move, slowly and ponderously, all too often with all deliberate lack of speed - to become a partner of sorts with the American underclass in their struggle to do better for themselves. The last few years have changed all that. The government’s attitude changed from benign concern to malignant neglect. 
In the decade of the sixties, the number of people living in poverty was nearly halved. 
It’s not unreasonable at all to ascribe some of these gains to the great society programs of the era. 
Yet the callous castrators moved cold calculation to kill, freeze or wind down urban renewal, model cities, community action, public service employment, student loans, public housing, federal impact funds for education, and to impose a sixty percent national pull-back in social services. 
6 
Human problems are now placed on a balance sheet and forced to add up: to pay for themselves. The new administrators run the programs: they direct with the solicitude of a hungry mortician at an old folks home. 
We are where we are today because of a confluence of events of the sixties. The nonviolent marchers of the first part of that decade were replaced if not in fact then certainly in the public fancy, by the rapacious rioters in the last part of the sixties. 
American’s cities were believed to be either in flames, under martial law, or sinking under the dead weight of a population of pensioners, the unemployed young and their presumably unemployable parents. 
The rest of America was running from the city in a crisis state of their own. They rightly perceived that their taxes - higher proportionately than those payed by ITT - were escalating to pay for barely maintaining what they had run away from, but were wrongly taught - by their president and others - that their taxes were high because of the lazy poor, and 
7
not because of the corporate evader or the military glutton. 
The rulers of the cities, on the other hand - the mayors, commissioners and councilmen - faced an all too common list of plagues we have come to call the urban crisis - drug addiction, increased racial friction, civil services militancy, housing destroyed by Plan “A” faster than it was constructed by Plan “B”; schools which warehoused and mis-educated their students, relief rolls giving relief to no one. For them the new federalism promised to be manna from heaven. 
It promised new money for them all, money to do what they then could not, money to pave the streets, to pay the police, to clean the air and water. 
Instead of manna and millions, it became pennies stolen from the poor, robbing Peter to pay Paul half of what Peter couldn’t get by on to begin with. 
The result was to shift the burden from the federal government where the resources were to the towns and cities where the resources aren’t. 
8 
The municipal managers, forced to choose between funding underfunded program X or Y, chose more often than not to buy votes at the expense of the public good, with tax rebates and fancy hardware. 
The administration’s rhetoric about sharing the wealth became a scandalous exercise in consolidating wealth and power where they always were: away from the cities, away from children, away from people for whom wealth is an extra meal, and power the ability to hide from the census taker. 
The often repeated connection between today’s dilemma and the end of the Reconstruction era is frightening, 
The collusion between a hostile administration and a seemingly unfeeling majority, then and now, seemed to doom the hope of the American underclass. 
Then and now, a president desperate for power made an arrangement. Not just with the unreconstructed South, but with the national 
9 
unreconstructed mentality that believes now - as it did then - that private profit and public arrogance could be pursued at the expense of the people living on the American margin. 
Concurrently, the liberal crusaders for social justice and democracy became tired, or involved in other, less traumatic concerns. For many of them, picking up beer cans by the side of the highway became an acceptable substitute to winning jobs for Black people in the brewery. Their coutrage, guilt and indignation receded as the dark plague came closer to liberal hearth and home. The outburst of bigotry in Boston is one such example. 
The aspirations of and movement by Black people began to be curtailed, not just by organized violence and barbarity, but by a series of national choreographed legal and extra-legal maneuvers designed to make us less than political and economic equals. 
The frenetic activity of the sixties created a political movement characterized by selfishness and fear; a political constituency was recruited from the frightened to form solid ranks against the forgotten. 
10 
Backlash is too hackneyed a term for people confused by long hair and frightened by clenched fists, their politics misdirected by those who verbally oppose crime in the streets and secretly practice crime in the suites. 
This manipulation of the American mind made the mundane magnificent and placed government in the hands of men who believe in privilege for the powerful and neglect of the powerless. 
I can think of no better prescription for relieving their crisis, and reviving interest in it, than by creating a partisan national coalition of need, of mothers who want care - not warehousing - for their children, of fathers who want work at a decent wage, of people who work for a living but can’t live on what they make aa well as those who can’t find work but can’t live on what we so grudgingly give, those who want an end to welfare and capitalism for the poor and subsidy and socialism for the wealthy and who must learn that sufficiency for people at the 
11
at the bottom can also mean stability for those in the middle: all those people now live in America, divided by race and class, fearful of each other, contentious and impotent. 
[Page 11 is duplicated in manuscript images, but not transcribed.]
12 
We are the victim of our own successes. 
When the right to sit at a lunch counter, or the front of the bus, or to cast a vote was won, too many of us tired from the struggle. 
Being Black became a rhetorical or sartorial accomplishment. Social commitment began to be measured by the length of your hair or the trickiness of your handshake. 
Dashikis made in Japan are taken as proof of Pan African sentiment, debate about the relative revisionism of Marcus Garvey replaced progressive action about anything. 
White young people who some years ago were marching militantly 
13 
in the streets are now running nude on the college grounds, attempting to prove that all men are not created equal. 
Those brothers and sisters who were bouyed by the beauty in Blackness now seemed bowled over by the Bumb, bid whist, and Boone’s Farm, or else believe they can smoke America to her knees. 
In Black politics, a decline is more than apparent. 
The hill billy Hitler in Alabama had to fight off Negro politicians in his state who wanted to be first to give him a rolling start toward the White House in ’76. 
In Georgia, I’m proud to say, we turned axe-handles into ashes, and sent the baldheaded bigot back to his backward bycycle riding.

We’ve hopefully seen a shift away from the racist politics of the past. The victories of George Busbee and Zell Miller over candidates who appealed to racial fears and the lowest level of Georgia’s voters is a sign that we are slowly moving forward. 
It was discouraging, however, looking back over this election campaign, to see that there are Black people in Georgia who will support a candidate for cash, not commitment; who endorse a politician for pretty promises, and not for principle; who cast their votes for dollars, and not out of duty to the state’s Black people. 
Just as we need to defeat white candidates who are hostile to our interest, we need to defeat and destroy those Black influence peddlers who sell our votes and bargain away our life chances for their own pocketbook interests. 
Each of you knows such people in your own communities. Each of you knows someone who is for sale, every election, to white politicians most of you wouldn’t even speak to. When you leave this convention, you need to return home determoned to root out these parasites, the political prostitutes, to 
In local elections, the state-wide Black community did well, but not well enough. 89 Black candidates ran for office in the August primary, and there will be 21 Blacks - two Senators and 19 Representatives - in the General Assembly when it convenes in January. 
Twelve Blacks running for county commission - out of a total of 37 - won. Two Blacks will sit on the Fulton County Commission, and Blacks were elected in Talbot, Bibb, Monroe, Hancock and Twiffs Counties. Two Blacks were elected to county school boards elsewhere in the state. 
What was disappointing was the low turnout of Black voters throughout the state. In my county, Fulton, only 32% of the eligible Blacks voted in the primary, and only 48% elsewhere in the state. 
15 
In the 1970 and 1972 congressional elections, those Americans who longed for cleaner air and water aimed their sights at members of the U.S. House who placed profits over human pleasure, and cleaned house. During most of last year, those forces in America who wanted day care legislation passed, massed their power and saw it through both houses of Congress, only to be thwarted by presidential veto, and give up the ghost. 
16 
There must be a confluence of all these forces for good, from now on. But the forces that want clean air ought not support a man with a dirty heart. Those of us who applaud a congressman who is right on pollution ought not vote for him if he’s wrong on people. If your senator is wrong on welfare but right on rivers, make him right on welfare, too. 
Building such a movement is an old and rather faded dream: its chances of success have never been easy. Its difficulties have always been immense, but its urgency has never been greater. 
17
We need to begin now to register each and every one of the unregistered, and to begin again to try to set up the machinery we so badly need to tyrn out every voter in every election from now on. 
Too many of us believe that the battles won on yesterday are won forever. Too many of us believe that the hard struggles are over. Too many of us believe that prayer will heal everything, and not enough of us believe that God helps those who help themselves. 
Let me leave you with some words from a distinguished Black man who lived in this country over 100 years ago. 
His name was Frederick Douglass, and he said then: 
18 
“He who would be free must strike the first blow. You know that liberty given is never so precious as liberty sought for and fought for. The man who is outraged is the man who must make the first outcry. Depend on it, men will not care much for a people who do not care for themselves. Men will organize to prevent cruelty to animals, for they are dumb creatures, and cannot speak for themselves, but we are men, and men must speak for themselves or we shall not be spoken for at all. We hold it self evident that no class or color should be the exclusive rulers of this country. If there is such a ruling class, there must be, of course, a subject class, and when that condition is established, the government of the people, by the people and for the people will perish from the earth.”

Most of the changes are measurable, and most can be measured comparatively. [Then] the number of Black elected officials stood at this level — today it stands here. Then the number of Black registered voters [stodd] at this figure: today it stands higher. 
Despite the thrmendous percentile increases in the numbers of Black registered voters and Black elected officials in this region of the country since the passage of the voting rights act in 1965, [illegible] it remains a necessity today:
Here is what the Washington Research Project reported in its Study, The Shameful Blight:
Black voter registration in the seven southern states specially covered under the Voting Rights Act is still low, both in absolute and in comparative terms. There are many practices in different parts of the South which limit black registration.
1. Hours of registration are customarily limited to normal business hours, making it inconvenient for blacks to register.
In Leflore County, Mississippi voter registration is possible between 8 a.m. and 5 p.m., Monday through Friday. ""In order for most of the rural people to go to register,"" it was reported, ""it has to be a rainy day because their boss will not let them off work to go and register."" On one occasion six potential registrants were unable to register because ""the registrar stalled for time until time for the office to close.""
2. Registration is usually only possible at the county courthouse, an inconvenient location for many blacks. Black registration in Clay County, Mississippi is limited because registration is only conducted in the county seat, which ""is located in the corner of the county. Many people have to go as many as 30 miles in order to register. As a result, those who do not own cars do not bother to register, also it is rather expensive for those who own cars to make very many trips to town to get people registered.""
3. The states and counties rarely take action to publicize the need for registration or assume the burden of assuring that residents are registered.
When Jasper County, Mississippi required all voters to reregister it gave no notice of this requirement over the radio, and newspaper publicity, according to the Department of Justice, was inadequate and misleading.
4. Many blacks, especially in rural areas, are still afraid to register; often this fear is reasonable; seldom is it counteracted.
In southwest Georgia ""people are still afraid to register — and with good reason — for fear of economic sanction or physical sanctions that may be applied against them if they do."" The blacks least likely to have registered are ""the people who work in plants and are maids, the day laborers and unskilled workers; in short, those who are the most vulnerable to economic pressures if they register.""
5. In some jurisdictions public officials have interfered with voter registration drives; in others, private persons have done so.
The circuit clerk in Humphreys County, Mississippi was completely uncooperative during a voter registration campaign. On one Monday registration workers arrived at his office at 2 p.m., to be told that he had gone to a funeral and would not be back. On Tuesday they came back with other applicants at 9 a.m. ""They were told Mr. Hood (the clerk) was busy. At 9:30 he was allegedly on the phone. At 10:00 he left and said he had to go to a supervisory meeting."" On Wednesday the workers arrived at 4:15 p.m. ""Mr. Hood met them at the door, saying the office was closed."" On Friday they arrived at 1 p.m. They were told that the clerk had gone to his lawyer's office. The local telephone company refused to install a telephone for the voter registration campaign conducted by a black organization in Calhoun County, Arkansas until a complaint was filed with the state public service commission. The local bank gave the organization ""considerable runaround"" concerning the opening of an account.
6. In some jurisdictions a purge of the registration rolls has placed a heavier burden on blacks than on whites or has been carried out in a manner which discriminates against blacks.
Blacks in Hale County, Alabama wanted a purge of the registration rolls because 136 percent of the white population was registered compared to 68 percent of the black. Ninety percent of the four thousand persons purged in the two-third black county, however, were black.
There can be no doubt that simple justice requires that the 1965 Voting Rights Act be extended for another five years at a minimum, and enforced more vigorously in the future than it has been in the past.
But a quick review of the process that brought the act the fruition, the agitation that upset a nation and forced a reluctant President Lyndon Johnson to go before the Congress could not be ignited again.
For one, we [illegible] have lost our standard bearer, the single Black figure who could inspire us to acts of individual and mass courage.
But more importantly, we seem to have lost our will toward action, toward movement, toward the kind of dedication that [illegible] typified the sixties, that made a reluctant congress move.
For as we have reaped the benefits of the social activism of the '60s, too many of us have fallen into the sleep of the '70s, lulled into calm by a large number of Black faces in high places.
We have used the local political process to improve ourselves, and lately have become its the victims of the process on a national level.
[New typeset starts at this page break. Page numbers have not been transcribed because they do not correspond to this speech sequence.]
There ought to be no denying however that the ancient art of politics ought to have first priority for the poverty stricken and [illegible] in [illegible] the 70s.
That is because it is politics which decides -- in the end -- what kinds of lives, if any -- our children will have, what kind of world we will live in, and what our futures will be.
It was politics that sent some of our sons to Southeast Asia, to shoot and kill and be killed by other mother's sons they'd never seen; it was politics that bought some back home.
Politics has wounded some more here than there, making them first in war, last in peace, and seldom in the hearts of their countrymen.
Politics has decreed that unemployment for Black people will be 2 to 3 times the national average, and politics has decided we'll live in a permanent depression, conversely, it is politics which can guarantee jobs and income for us now.
The political process -- at its best -- represents a great debate over philosophical principles and definitions of government's role in disolving conflicts between economic and racial interest groups; at its worst it is tweedledum versus tweedledee, or plays for power between competing political parties.
The higher debate is seldom clearly heard; it is more often obscured by personality -- or lack of it; appeals to patriotism, scare tactics or ordinary obfuscation of the issues.
The clever observer and student can see through this haze, can see groups forming and falling apart.
Such a student probably sees that the last great contest in this nation was not Republicans against Democrats or Nixon -vs- McGovern.
It was instead a victory for a mighty coalition of the comfortable, the callous and the smug, who closed their ranks, their minds and their hearts against the claims and calls to conscience put forward by the forgotten and unrepresented elements in American society.
This then, was total triumph for the national nullification of the needs of the needy, the gratuitous gratification of the gross and the greedy, of supreme swinishness and satisfied selfishness.
It climaxed four years of abject surrender in the war on poverty, of a diminuation of civil liberties, of threats to civil rights.
It promised four more years of five o'clock shadow and half past promises, of broken dreams and busted hopes.
But suddenly the golden ring [illegible] came round again.
Those who wanted four more years now hope for two off with good behavior. Those who publically [illegible] opposed crime in the streets [are] were caught privately practicing crime in the suites.
The revolt against the new reconstruction, the radical reformation of relationships between the governed and the governors began in the late sixties.
Nearly a decade of agitation and demonstrations preceded the revolt, and the frenetic activity of the sixties created a political movement characterized by selfishness and fear. Backlash does not adequately describe a population frightened by long hair or terrified by clenched fists; but this massive manipulation of the American mind did make the mundane magnificent, and put government in the hands of men and women who believe in priviledge for the powerful and neglect of the powerless.
As the middle of the 60s rolled by, the situation of Black people became static and the following trends began to emerge:
-- Many of the former fervent supporters of what used to be called the civil rights movement began to be diverted by other, less traumatic concerns. For [illegible] many, picking up beer cans by the side of the highway became an acceptable substitute to winning jobs for Black people in the brewery. For many others, the loveable and peaceful non-violent marchers of the first part of the decade were replaced -- if not in fact, then certainly in the public fancy by the rapacious rioters of the [illegible] end of the decade.
Private attention turned from the public problems of Black and brown poor people.
The cruel and callous castrators in Washington moved with cold calculation to kill and condense urban renewal, model cities, community action, public service employment, student loans, public housing, federal impact funds for education, and to impose a 60% national pull back in social services.
Human problems are are now placed on a balance sheet and forced to add up; to pay for themselves: the new administrators in Washington run the programs they direct with all the solicitude of a hungry mortician at an old folks home.
While the nation waltzed into the 70s believing that its Black problem had been blown or burned away:
-- infant mortality rates for us remained twice as high as for everyone else;
-- nearly half of all Black families in the United States earned less than $5,000.00 a year;
-- the average Black American was dying seven years earlier than his white counterpart:
-- we remained the last to be hired and the first to be fired.
While [illegible] American liberalism was brought into a state of dissaray by its failure to mount successful and sustained campaigns against the continuing war in Southeast Asia, and while the [illegible] college youth who formerly marched militantly in the streets were discovered running naked through the college grounds -- attempting to prove perhaps that all men are not created equal -- some weaknesses in our own ranks appeared.
Many of our young people who were bouyed in the '60s by the beauty in Blackness now seem bowled over by the bougaloo, bid-whist and [illegible] Boone's Farm. Many apparently believe their politics can be expressed by the length of their hair or the complexity of their handshakes.
Our community -- which has always had its share of charlatans and knaves, now seems overflowing with political pimps of all kinds. They endorse candidates not because they're good but because they'll win; they respect no party or [principal] principle but owe allegiance only to themselves; you cannot engage them in a battle of wits for they are all unarmed men.
Throughout this depression of mind and soul that has afflicted Black America, the political process, its successes and failures, has held the attention of an increasing number of Black men and women.
You all know of the Tom Bradley’s and Maynard Jacksons and Coleman Youngs. You know of Barbara Jordan and Shirley Chisholm. But did you know:
-- that the number of Black elected officials in the 11 Southern states has increased by 2000% since 1964?
-- that on May 7, when 30% of the white voters and 93% of the Black voters in Alabama were saying no to George Wallace that voters in that state elected 14 Blacks to the State House and Senate, re-elected four of the six Black sheriffs in the whole United States and nominated another.
-- over 150 Black and Native American candidates ran for office in the May 7th primaries in North Carolina.
-- that the Nov 4th primary in Texas gives 11 Blacks a chance to sit in the State House.
-- that Black people are registered to vote in proportionately [large] larger numbers in Selma, Alabama than they are in Chicago and New York.
-- that Black and white people in Georgia [moved to] [illegible] to deny the asinine axe-handle-holder and sent him back to his backward bicycles.
the one-fourth of all Blacks in Congress are women; that [illegible] of all in the Georgia legislature are Black.
-- that Black women and men in the Southern region have a faith in the political process that reflects neither the naivete of the political voice nor the cynicism of the jaundiced veteran.
They are men and women who reject the notion that all politicians are hachks and fools; they believe that politics must mean people and their problems, and not just candidates and elections.
-- they know they face a hard period ahead where help from elsewhere will not come forth as swiftly as it once did.
Unlike their counterparts in the East and West, they have developed a staying power that follows a continuous line from the middle 1950s to the present; through sit-ins and freedom rides to voter marches, today's Southern Black politics is an unbroken continuum; the political process is the natural end product for a people who see struggle as a continual -- and not an occasional process.
As this region of the country produced America’s moral leadership, in earlier decades, it continues to produce the political model for today.
Several themes dominate the thinking of political activists in the Southern region today.
Foremost among them is the retention and extension of the 1965 Voting Rights Act. on its expiration in 1975; This single piece of legislation is responsible for the enfrachisement of millions of Black men and women, the election of 1000 more, the elimination [illegible] gerrymandered districts and restrictive voting practices and most recently, for the granting of political rights and representation to Black people outside of the Southern region. It must be renewed.
[A different typeset begins at this page break.]
If the fight for simple extension of the existing act is successfully waged, there are many who believe that other battles in this arena must be fought as well.
One is for a national voting rights act, legislation that will give the underregistered Black and brown people of the North and [illegible] West the same protection enjoyed in this region now.
Another is for a single system of post card registration, administered on the federal level, eliminating the petty [illegible] obstacles of time and geography which conspire to keep a large portion of of potential American electorate unregistered.
One final need is for the establishment of a national holiday for national election, or at least, for [the] holding such elections on Sunday when the smallest portion of Americans are at work.
Only [illegible] when these steps are taken can we believe that every citizen has free and equal access to the franchise, and to the opportunity to pick and choose among the candidates who wish to govern us.
[A different typeset begins at this page break.]
In national affairs, Southern Black politicians are developing the regional muscle to deliver white votes in the United States House and Senate. In creating home rule for the District of Columbia and in constructing a constituency for repeal of the Byrd Amendment, it was the loosely organized network of small town mayors and rural county commissioners that insisted to their representatives in Congress that they cannot support racism in Rhodesia and enjoy Black support at home.
On the local level, these women and men have restored confidence in elected officials and have made their governments become the delivery systems for goods and services they ought to be.
They pave streets and pick up garbage; they make Johnny-Be-Good be good; they make office holding the high calling it is supposed to be.
They refuse to be diverted by the romantic rhetoricians and second-hand victims of oppression. [illegible] They insist on service, the demand that democracy now be made safe for them.
Their attention is now focused on state politics -- the possibility reality of nearly 40 new Black state legislators in three Southern states.
They focus additionally on other races too.
[A different typeset begins at this page break.]
I think the people of this region know that today is not like yesterday, and know that we are in a difficult period,
[A different typeset begins at this page break.]
a period in which there are no student caravans south, in which there are no visiting, sympathetic congressmen, a period in which no entertainers will dance and sing for them in small back country churches.
I said, earlier in my remarks, that some people like to think of this problem as ""The Black Problem."" They are also those other Americans who come from groups of European immigrants -- unlike us, voluntary immigrants, to be sure -- who believe that since they have risen to influence and affluence, then Black people can easily do the same. And there are some who profess sympathy and understanding but ask ""What can i do?"" Frederick Douglass, in his 77th year, answered all of these questions: He said ""The marvel is that the old trick of misnaming things, so often displayed by Southern politicians, should have worked so well for the bad cause for which it is now employed, for the American people have fallen in with the bad idea that this is a Negro problem, a question of the character of the Negro, and not a question of the nation . . . . He has as little to do with the cause of the problem as he has to do with its cure. Now what the real problem is we all ought to know. It is not a Negro problem, but a national problem. It involves the question of whether after all our boasted civilization, our Declaration of Independence, our Constitution, our sublime Christianity, our statesmanship, we as a people, possess virtue enough to solve this problem.
""But how can the problem be solved? Let the white people of the North and South conquer their prejudices. Let the American people cultivate kindness and humanity. Let them give up the idea that they can be free while making the Negro a slave. They are not required to do much. They are only required to undo the evil they have done, in order to solve this problem.
""Put away your race prejudice. Banish the idea that one class must rule over another. Recognize the facts that the rights of the humblest of citizens are as worthy of protection as are those of the highest and your problem will be solved, and whatever may be in store for you in the future, whether prosperity or adversity, whether you have foes without or within, whether there shall be peace or war, based on the eternal principles of truth, justice and humanity, with no class having cause for complaint or grievance, your republic will stand and flourish forever . . . .""*"

Martin Luther King at the end of a protest march? Lyndon Johnson announcing a guaranteed annual wage for all Americans? If you guessed Orville Freeman, you win a pound of rutabagas.
Those were Freeman's remarks in October, 1966 at the opening of Cooperative Month Observance in Washington.
Freeman's vision of the role of cooperatives his department helps through the Farmer's Home Daministration isn't confined to small town America either. He seens them helping ""people of the developing nations live better and extend their control over their nation's economic affairs"" and in fact helping the same people to ""fashion their own destinies.""
In a movie - before Secretary Foreman's tenure - I saw a displayed in a farmer's home [illegible] ""Charity Begins at Home.""
Some fashioning of destinies needs to be extended to the several hundredSome fashioning of destinies needs to be extended to several hundred thousand Negro farmers, farm workers and sharecroppers in the rural South.
More than most other Americans, they need to ""extend their control over their nation's economic affairs.""
Their condition has worsened as their civil rights have increased. For every lunch counter seat won and black vote recorded, a farm a home or a job has been lost or erased.
2
The important right - the right to exist - still eludes them.
The number of American farms has decreased in the middle '60s to what it was 100 years ago, and is expected to worsen. What has happened is that mechanization and technological improvements have increased in the size of farms -- from 150 acres on the average in 1875 to 359 acres in 1966 - while the number of farmer-propreitors has decreased.
In 1920, a peak year, there were nearly a million Negro farm operators. Fewer than 200,000 remain today. Less than half of these are owners or part owners. The farms they operate are one-fifth the size of the average white-operated farm. 71% of their homes are delapidated, onlyone third have telephones, one out of eight has no off-farm transportation (no car) and more than half don't produce enough to classify as commercial farmers.
There have been Negro increases, however. The number of Negro adult farm residents has increased 250% since 1946 - from 2% to 7%.
The increase came among those who farm for a wage. Negro farm workers do one-half of the farm work in the South and get paid about 80¢ an hour. (The federal minimum wage covers some, but North Carolina, for instance, claims that tobbacco workers are ""contrct labor"" and exempt from coverage).
But the general trend for the black farmer is away from the farm. The Atlanta office of the National Sharecropper's Fund figures that in the five years between 1959 and 1964, Alabama lost 9,000 Negro farmers, North Carolina nearly 14,000, South Carolina nearly 10,000 and Mississippi 11,000.
Over 50% of the Negro tenant farmers in Alabama dissapeared in this period, and 45% of those in Mississippi went away.
While farmers of both races are decreasing, Negroes vanish nearly twice as fast as whites.
The Fund's figures end in 1964, the last year a farmer' s census was taken, and the year the most recent great black migration should have begun in earnest.
3
The Mississippi Delta is a case in point. Normal mechanization replaces workers in every industry - in farming, every 1,000 acres of cotton mechanised and chemically weeded makes 50 familes superfolous. The Food and Agriculture Act of 1965 erased cotton agreage that supplied a living - however marginal - for 15,400 familes, who are now considered ""surplus.""
""Where these families will live and what these families will do to earn a living are two of the most important questions that can be asked in the South and the nation,"" writes Al Ulmer of the Southern Regional Council. ""As yet, they stand unanswered.""
Secretary Freeman provides a few answers himself, however, but when he does they are likely to be untrue.
In his Cooperate Observance Month speech, Freeman remarked that his department had established 600 cooperatives serving more than 8,000 rural families. ""All are integrated with both Negroes and white families participating as members, officers and patrons,"" he declared.
When the Sharecropper's Fund's Atlanta Director, Jac Wasserman, pressed him for a listing, a Freeman assistant [illegible] admitted the Secretary's remarks had been ""in error."" In fact, of Freeman's 600 cooperatives, fewer than 30 are true cooperatives, chartered and incorporated, and only 28 are integrated. The rest are loose associations of three or more farmers receiving a loan for which they are individually, not cooperatively, liable.
As the voting drive spread throughout the rural, agricultural South, plantation owners were quick to realize a final solution to Negro majorities and even Negro minority blocs. At its best, it was the Freedom Ride North of '61 and '62; at its worst, a calculated program to drive Negroes from the land and away from the black belt.
A memorandum prepared after a Christmas visit to Mississippi by Michael Piore, a MIT Economics Instructor and former Mississippi Freedom Summer worker, suggests that as many as 100,000 Delta Negroes will be forced to leave this year.
4
Piore reports that in 1964 ""state and federal officials"" in Mississippi felt that out-migration of Negroes was the only ""long run solution to the state's problems.""
Piore's report says ""the growth of Negro registration has added a sense of urgency to these problems.""
He says the shift in welfare programs from free commodities to food stamps - where minimal cash payments are required - ""provides a means of starving the evicted tenants out of the state.""
And what is Secretary Freeman doing about this? Not too much. He had to be sued in 1966 by SNCC and SCLC and 37 Alabama Negro farmers to set up non-discriminatory elections to choose ASCS (Agricultural Stabilization and Conservation Service) Committeemen in 11 black belt counties.
The suit, Williams, et al vs Freeman, et al, tried to enjoin the Agriculture Department from holding ASCS elections until Freeman could guarantee fairness and and end to intimidation.
They won a one-month postponment, and out of 1827 ASCS committeemen chosen in Alabama, 18 were Negroes, and increase of 7 over 1965 (ASCS Committees, farmers elected by farmers, administer price support and crop allotment programs in cotton, corn, wheat and peanuts. Negro farmers complain they are not given notice of elections, and denied the right to vote or prevented physically from doing so. Freeman's office joyously announced a few years ago that Negro farmers living in Mound Bayou, Mississippi had won ASCS positions, but neglected to mention that Mound Bayou is an all-Negro town.)
In February 1965, President Johnson ordered the Agriculture Department to set up the Rural Community Development Service to act as a laision between Department field workers at the county level and all federal agencies administering rural programs. A year ago, its operations consisted of eleven Southern states. Each state had one office, usually with two administrators and a secretary. Today, all of the offices are closed.
The rural poor are in the plight they're in, the OEO says, because they 
5
""have no political power, and what they have is so widely dispersed it is ineffective. They have no money to spend, so they have no pwer in the commercial world. They just don't reach the power structure in our society.""
Aptly put, but better put as a condition, rather than a reason. Perhaps someday Vietnamese farmers will come into the Mississippi Delta to show Negro sharecroppers how to ""improve their methods and increase food production."" And the Vietnamese Secretary of Agriculture will speak of helping Southern America's rural black poor to live better, to ""overcome ignorance, prejudice, tyranny, hunger, and disease.""
Because if he doesn't, no one else will.

In an attempt to ""let people in rural areas know that the administration is interested in their problems and successes,"" Freeman has taken to visits among the Southern, rural poor.
He has charged through Alabama, Georgia and South Carolina communities over the past few months,
Less than two months after Freeman left Georgia, the State Advisory Committee to the United States Commission on Civil Rights reported ""rural Negroes in Georgia do not receive the equal opportunity and equal treatment they are entitled to as beneficiaries of federally assisted agricultural programs.""
In Georgia, the report said, federal compliance in segregated agricultural programs begins ""in childhood when they (Negroes) are excluded from 4-H Club work and continues in later life when they are excluded from programs of the Extension service and from services of specialists in FHA and the Agricultural and Stabilization Conservation Service. From their formative school years through their productive years when they are denied services, including jobs with the agricultural programs for which they qualify, to the day they retire or die, Negro farmers in Georgia are relegated to the status of second-class citizens,"" the Committee reported."

We are, as a group of people in this nation, several things. We are poor; we are unemployed and underemployed. We are poorly educated. We are powerless. And we are Black.
We are all of the other things because of the last two, because of our powerlessness and our color.
We have heard over the past few years a great many calls for us to unite around those two factors, and most of us have refused to do so.
We have believed, like most Americans, that power is evil and corrupting, and we have believed, like most Americans, that associations based on race are evil also.
So instead, we have turned toward discussion, toward holding conferences. And after that is completed, it appears that we have not yet learned the lesson, the lesson of history,
2
the lesson that ought to suggest one way to solve the problem we find ourselves in.
The reason is partly, I believe, because we didn't do our reading well enough, or didn't absorb what we read. For if we had, we would have read the following:
From Che Guevera: ""The streets of Harlem are not the mountains of the Sierra Mastre"".
From Franz Fanon: ""There is no native who does not dream at least once a day of settling himself up in the settler's place"".
From Stokeley Carmichael: ""Violent warfare may be unavoidable...But if there is the slightest chance to avoid it, the politics of Black power... is seen as the only viable hope"".
And from Rap Brown: ""There are a lot of people with natural hair and processed minds"".
This suggests, to me at least, that revolution is not
3
imminent. It suggests that those who believe that it is are as wrong as was the CIA when they predicted the Cuban masses would rise up to drive Castro from Cuba.
It suggests to me that lacking the immediate prospects for revolution, immediate attention ought to be directed to the problems that all of us know run epidemic through the Black and poor communities.
It suggests to me that a lot of us would rather read than act, would rather naturalize our hair than our minds, and would rather applaud speakers than speak or act themselves.
There were political campaigns occuring in the two Carolinas that ought to have caught the imagination and activity of young Blacks as the campaigns of Eugene McCarthy and Robert Kennedy caught the imagination of young whites.
4
In one of these, a Black dentist was defeated in a race for the governor's seat in North Carolina... If there is anyone here who thinks it makes no difference what sort of governor you have, let him come to Georgia with me and I will show him a difference.
There was in Charleston, South Carolina, a young Black lawyer running against Representative Mendle Rivers for a seat in the United States House of Representatives.
If there is anyone here who thinks it makes no difference whether or not Mendle Rivers sits in Congress or not, then let him consider who the biggest racists in Congress are: Mendle Rivers' name is near the top. If those issues are not important, and the men who manipulate them are not important, then nothing is important.
Charles Evers ran for a congressional seat in Mississippi
5
and Black people there, militant and conservative, came together to help his campaign. But none came from outside the state, there was no outpouring of students to campaign or cash to pay the bills.
In the Indiana campaign, McCarthy and Kennedy had thousands of young people working for them because those young people believe it makes a difference.
There will be campaigns in Brooklyn for Congress where a Black man will win... In St. Louis for Congress where a Black man will win... In Cleveland for Congress where a Black man will win... Which of you will leave school to help?
In 1964, young Black and white students gathered in Mississippi by the thousands. Where are you now?
In 1962, there was a group called the Northern Student Movement, which put thousands of youngsters into tutorial programs, began grass roots organizing programs in the ghettos of the big ci
6
cities.
Where are you now?
Some of you are interested in university reform, in Black history on your campuses, in making the university responsible to the community.
First, however, the university's immediate constituents, the students, must become responsive to the community.
Our condition as a people has gotten progressively worse, and the young, those best equipped through training and energy to help solve that condition, have increasingly removed themselves from the community.
Southern Black people can now eat at integrated lunch counters, take an integrated bus ride north, arrive in a city with a fair housing ordinance and an equal employment law, and discover they have no jobs. The machines that drove them off the farms have beat them to the city. Wherever we are concentrated, the true rate of unemployment ranges from twenty to
7
fifty percent.
In the rural South, the lucky ones barely subsist on federal commodities ... The others starve, welfare is a relief to people in that condition, but present welfare regulations strangle our families and cause their disruption.
We have progressed from slave labor to cheap labor to no labor at all.
Now the nation proposes new programs to deal with its urban problem, in reality its Black problem, which is in reality a mirror of its white problems.
The Urban Coalition certainly wants to ease urban troubles, but, its interests are directly opposite from the interests of the poor. The Johnson Administration, for example, has plans to subsidize business to hire and train some 500,000 men and women by 1971. That 500,000 averages out to about 3,500
8
for each of fifty target cities. The quota for Washington, D.C. is 2,000 new jobs... Estimates of the need in Washington reach as high as 15,000.
Business is out to make money. When it needs people, it hires them and doesn't need a government subsidy to do so.
The problems of the poor, Black and white, are aggravated by their lack of organization. Organized labor organized the working classes, and the organized working people of this country have risen to comfortable affluence, have been able to guard programs designed to help them, and are now able to help defeat proposals designed to bring the poor closer to the great society.
The poor who have no political power are always left behind. Workers with no bargaining power, like agricultural workers, still receive the short end of the stick.
The unorganized are victimized by programs designed to
9
benefit them. In 1935, public welfare programs were enacted which promised an adequate income for everyone. In 1968, more than 30 years later, the average family of four receiving ADC gets only $1,800 a year. The Public Housing Act of 1937 promised decent housing for the poor; today there are still ten million substandard housing units in the United States and the country has built only 600,000 units of public housing.
Other programs intended to help everyone have been turned against the poor. Federal agricultural subsidies have built up large farms and made it impossible to run small ones. The Housing Act of 1949, instead of establishing the right of every American to a decent home, has in the name of urban renewal, destroyed 350,000 low rental homes. In fact, federal programs... either urban renewal, highway construction and other public works... have destroyed more low rent housing than has
10
been built since public housing was first initiated.
The very programs that the poor have gotten for themselves have paralyzed them and inhibited their capacity for action. What welfare recipient in Chicago dares vote against the Daley machine? What Mississippi sharecropper who exists on commodities doled out by his county's commissioners would dare organize against Senator Eastland?
How then can the poor, particularly the Black poor, begin to force their way into positions of power?
Of course, our growing numbers in the center of large American cities points one way for us. We are approaching the point at which in a matter of ten years, we shall be in control of Atlanta, Georgia; Richmond, Virginia; Jacksonville, Florida; Gary, Indiana; Baltimore, Maryland; St. Louis, Missouri; Newark, Detroit, and Trenton.
That control will be beneficial for us only if two
11
important factors are in control when that point in time for our take over appears.
First, we must have become more unified than we are today. We must have unity between those with Ph.D.s and those with no degrees; between those who've walked in Harvard yard and those who walked out of their high school play yard.
Once in power, we can begin to demand... and get... the sorts of things we need. With a Black mayor in Newark, the building trades will have to admit Blacks or stop building. With a Black city manager in Richmond, employers who want city contracts will have to hire Black people.
However, Black people are beginning to control cities at a time when cities are beginning not to be objects of desire, at a time when every American city, in addition to racial troubles, has troubles of every other kind. Metropolitan and city-county
12
governments are coming in vogue, and these will take over power as Blacks take over the cities.
The Black middle class will be absorbed into white corporate agencies and perhaps even into the suburbs, as the Black poor continue to swell and multiply in the center city.
What then are the prospects for the poor, huddled together in the slums of our big cities?
It can only be to begin now to seize control. Black people must accelerate the rate at which the Irish and Italians and Hungarians and other groups came to these shore and took power from the urban machine.
Black people must begin to care about each other, and in caring, begin to get ourselves together, to get rich and poor and old and young together so that we may begin to enjoy some of the fruits of the American Dream.
13
For us it has been a nightmare. We must begin to wake up. We must begin to demand, systematically, in an organized way, the power to do what we want and need done.
We must begin now, and we must not stop, our attempt to win the right to be men and women in this time at this place... We want it all, we want it now.
We must have it... and once having achieved it, one can never let it go.
We will be a free people or we must know the reason why. Someone must pay if we fail... We have paid for four hundred years of prosperity for much of America... Dues are owed us, and we demand payment in full.
That demand can only be made in an organized way. It can only be made by organized people. Black people will never be an organized group of people until we organize our-
14
selves, until we get off the campus and into the streets; out of our middle class, middle brow lives and into the lives of the masses of people for whom we claim to speak.
If a new sort of movement, a Black movement springs from the active protests and organizing drives of the early sixties, it must be first of all (small ""d"") democratic. It must extend to every member of the Negro community the opportunity to have a say in who gets what from whom. It must cast its votes in a unit, it must deal with problems on a local, regional, national and international basis, and it must decide that freedoms not enjoyed in Watts or Sunflower County cannot be enjoyed in Westchester County.
It must declare itself in the interests of laboring people, but not become the mistress of organized labor.
It must pay as much attention to a street light in a fifty foot alley as it does to national legislation involving millions of people, and international complications involving the future of the world.
15
It must maintain a militance and an aggressiveness that will earn it the respect of those it challenges.
If there are any rules peculiar to a new movement, they are these:
1. That social, economic, educational, political and physical segregation and discrimination fill a very real need for the white majority:
2. That appeals to justice and fair play are outmoded and useless when power, financial gain and prestige are at stake:
3. That positions of segregation and discrimination will be adhered to until change is forced through coercion, threats, power or violence:
4. That initiative for Black political education and organization must come from within the Negro community and must be sustained on a day-by-day basis:
16
5. That the geographical distribution of Negroes makes Negro-white coalitions desirable, but only when based on racial self-interest and genuine equality between the coalescing groups; but
6. That racial self-interest, race consciousness and racial solidarity must always be paramount in the deeds and words of the Black political animal; when self-interest is forgotten, organized racism will continue to dominate and frustrate the best organized political actions of any group of Black people, and will leave them powerless and defenseless.
This Black movement must address itself to solving America's white problem, to developing a new sophistication and consciousness in the Black and white communities, and in making democracy safe for the world.
Peaceful protests... and the bloodied heads of anon
17
ymous thousands... have won the lunch counter seat, the bus station bench, the integrated toilet and the vote. The vote and concentrated, united political action can be a tool for further, more meaningful gains, the gains that fill bellies and build homes and schools, but only if we reject the sort of equality that we are winning today.
That equality gives us an equal chance to be poor, and equal chance to be unemployed, an equal chance to drop out of school, and a more than equal chance to fight for someone else's freedoms thousands of miles from home.
That equality must be suppressed and replaced with an equality that provides full employment, guaranteed incomes, and makes the American nightmare the American Dream.
Only when we have gotten ourselves together, only when we shall have decided who are our enemies, and where
18
the battleground ought to be, only when we know in our hearts we are right and only when we demand that our worst off are treated as well as white America's best off, will we begin to see whether this system and this method can make a difference in our lives.
If that day does not come, then America will really begin to realize Langston Hughes' prophecy... That dreams deferred do explode.
Watts and Newark were like firecrackers to a hydrogen bomb if the dream is deferred much longer. For Langston Hughes wrote another poem: 
Negroes 
Sweet and gentle, 
Soft and kind. 
Pity the day 
They change their mind

It does not present a pretty picture.
The long fingers of American might are still sticking in other people's pies. More than 500,000 American soldiers are still engaged in trying to tell the Vietnamese people what kind of government they can have and under what circumstances.
Here at home, the streets of America have not quieted down from last summer, and the upcoming one promises to be just as long and my be just as hot.
2
On the campus, attempts at reform are rebuffed, and attempts at revolution are suppressed. Young people have discovered that our finest universities hold investments in slave mines, or research the best ways to defoliate jungles and people.
All Americans have learned over the past several months that the machinery that we are told was build to protect us - college deans and their machinery, county sheriffs and their machinery, political parties and their machinery, American presidents and their machinery - were in fact bent on suppressing those with whom they dealt.
We repudiated last November a potential president of the type who preached peace and practiced war. We elected one who has yet to demonstrate he has any concern for the poor and the Black.
For some Americans in 1968 last year, politics failed completely.
3
One potential candidate fell victim to an assasin's bullet; another was stilled by parliamentary democracy.
But some lessons didn't have to be learned.
It didn't take a Kerner Report for Black people to discover that white people were our problem, and not we theirs.
It didn't take Eugene McCarthy for some Americans to see that war against liberation and people in Southeast Asia was wrong, and it took only a few hours last August, in Chicago and Prague, to see that machines will crush liberty wherever it appears.
But overall, 1968 that was a learning year. Young whites learned .. and are still learning.. their lessons against trustees and regents and deans. Older people learned it against the County Chairman and the Ward boss. Blacks learned it against white people.
4
The lessons learned were simple. An old Black abolitionist, Frederick Douglass, stated it well when he said: ""Power concedes nothing without a demand; it never has and never will. Find out just what any people will quietly submit to, and you have discovered the exact measure of injustice and wrong which will be imposed upon them, and these will continue until they are resisted with either words, or blows, or both. The limits of tyrants are prescribed by the endurance of those whom they oppress.""
We must fight the battles still to be fought and won. The continuing battle against fascism will be most difficult. The police state tactics which began in the South against Blacks, were transferred to the campus for use against students, into the streets of Chicago for use against everyone, and which are now being
5
aimed at militant groups like the Panthers must be halted.
The use of the courts and law and order as an instrument of repression can be seen nowhere as clearly as in the persecution of Dr. Spock and in the curious case now going on in Chicago, in which eight people are charged with the unlikely offense of conspiring to incite the Chicago police to riot.
Another struggle which has to be supported is the battle to halt welfare programs for rich people. This must be the only country in the world which runs its economy on capitalism for poor people and socialism for rich people.
We annually spend more money on pet food than we do on food stamps. We pour vast federal subsidies into the oil industry and the cotton industry. We gave gentleman farmer Senator James O. Eastland $140,000 in farm subsidies, in effect paying him for doing nothing. But no one says that Eastland is lazy, and shiftless and a welfare bum. Some weeks ago, the United States House
6
of Representatives voted to place a $20,000 limit on the amount of money a farmer could receive for doing nothing; when will they begin to think about paying $20,000 a year to families, the poor and the Black, who cannot do for themselves?
Black people are seeing a real wave of racism sweeping the country. The elections in Los Angeles, Milwaukee and New York have clearly demonstrated that race is not an issue in southern politics alone, but that it is an issue and will be an issue in every municipal and county and state election for some time in the future. In 1970, there will be an opportunity to replace some of the worst racists and military merchants in Congress. Some of our larger American cities are turning Black; we will have the opportunity to put decent men in mayors' chairs all over this nation, but only if we get ourselves together.
7
There are other attacks being made on us. The federal government and the little tyrant who runs the FBI have given notice they believe they can with impunity listen in on the conversation of anyone in the United States. Just this summer, they admitted they planted bugs in the telephone, the living room and the automobile of one of our religious leaders, the honorable Elijah Muhammad. They admitted they bugged the conversations and hotel rooms of the late Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. The next time you call someone, or have a conversation with someone that you think is private, ask yourself whether Attorney General Mitchell and J. Edgar Hoover are listening in.
Over the last few weeks, we have seen a series of vicious and well coordinated attacks made by local policemen
8
and the FBI on the Black Panther Party, one of the vanguard organizations in the black liberation struggle. Their leaders have been arrested, their offices ransacked. You may not care what happens to the Black Panthers, although you should, but if you don't speak out when the Panthers are attacked, ask yourself, who will speak out for you?
And while Senator Thurmond, the Cinderella bridegroom from South Carolina, continues to subvert school education in the South, we must continue to fight that battle as well.
While the President of the United States and the puppet dictator of South Vietnam still continue to deny freedom of choice to the people of Southeast Asia, and while this government squanders money on the ABM (America's Biggest Mistake), we must continue to demand that men on earth receive equal treatment with men on the moon, and that there are 25 million poor people here who demand
9
that a war be fought at home, with just as much vigor and money as the war against people in Southeast Asia.
And when serious demands are made by serious people on some of the wealthiest financial institutions in the United States, the religious establishment, we have to fight to win that battle too. Don't let anyone tell you that the money will be used to line someone's pocket; we are demanding reparations to the tune of $15 a nigger, reparations to build a southern land bank, to build a Black publishing house, to help finance education for Black professionals, for the national welfare rights organizations. That battle must be fought as well, and when it is won, then American business must face our demands too.
You ought to face up to that demand. It is a right one. It is a just one. It is a proper one. Just remember, if you have any fondness for organized religion in this country, it was
10
the Christian church that brought my ancestors here in order to civilise them, and when the church came to Africa, we had the land and they had the Bible. Now all we have is the Bible.
Our difficulty is that we have no way to control or influence the several ways in which decision making in this society is ordered; we have little or no access to power centers in America.
The ""power centers"" are several; they include private wealth; the nation's 25 largest corporations (the annual revenues of General Motors are larger than the gross national product of all but the fifteen largest nations of the world); the military/industrial/labor complex, which overlaps with corporations; the federal and state governmental apparatus and organized crime.*
We are denied access to these center of power precisely
11
because when America was being divided and raped, we were not in a position to divide or rape but were instead being raped ourselves. Today we lack access to these centers of power because we are too small a group, too geographically dispersed.*
The prospects - or even the desirability of our taking over one or more of these centers of powers is slim. We must then prepare to deal with the possibility that only limited advantages are possible for us as a group while we remain tied to white America.
(Separatism, or more properly partition, would solve some of these problems for us; it is, however, a long range
12
prospect. Planning for it ought not get in the way of whatever limited gains are possible now).
Control of the resources, goods, institutions, services, the regulation of the flow of capital in and out of our community is a must.
What we need is not Black capitalism but a more properly called community socialism, so that we may have profit for the many instead of the few, so that neighborhoods and communities shall have the major say in who gets what from whom.
We need to find ways to control what we can. That means our politics as well as our economy. We need to seek out whatever allies are available, brown, yellow, red or black or white, on whatever issues appeals to us all.
One ray of hope could be offered by our young, those who are
13
now engaged in restructuring the university. There is a task waiting them outside the ivy covered walls of American education. There sit the millions, squeezed into slums, working if they work at all for pennies, being educated, if they are educated at all, to push mops and brooms, waiting and hoping for some salvation.
Of course, some do not wait at all, but are engaged every summer in restructuring the American slum.
But the young, after winning whatever victory is available on the playing fields of Harvard and Columbia, have a job to do. The job is physical, rather than verbal. The rhetoric heard from the campus and street corner has little meaning to a starving child or an unemployed father. That rhetoric must be made into a reality. If it is not, then we shall reap the whirlwind.
Finally, let us consider what kind of new movement can be built in this country. It is being built now, built by those who
14
were not frightened into inaction by the Meredith March in 1966; built by those who were told to organize their own, and did so, built by those who felt that both inside and outside the Chicago Convention, nothing was happening, those are building on the ashes of the 1964 drive by collete students to build a people's movement, a people's politics in America.
That movement faltered then. But it brought forth some hope. Hope which springs from American history which is not taught in any school, hope which suggests that a better day might just be possible, if the energy put into building it becomes equal to the energy put into discussing it.
Its possibility makes chilling the prediction of a Black Georgian, who, writing nearly 100 years ago, suggested a kind of struggle that ought to strike fear in the hearts and
15
minds of the kinds of comfortable people who come to hear - and perhaps applaud - speakers like myself.
He wrote in 1884:
"" . . . The future struggle in the South will be, not between white man and Black man, but between capital and labor, landlord and tenant. The hour is approaching when the laboring classes of this country, north, east, west and south, will recognize they have a common cause and a common enemy; and that therefore, if they would triumph over wrong and place the laurel wreath upon triumpahnt justice, without distinction of race or previous condition, they must unite. When the issue is properly joined, the rich, whether they be Black or white, will be found on one side . . .  And the poor, be they Black or be they white, will be found on the other.

The quadrennial occasion for American reaction or affirmation at the ballot box is now several months old. 
Reaction was reinforced on November 7, and now we suffer for it. It was a strange election, touching on many issues but affected primarily by one. 
It did not excite or agitate many people: nearly half of the registered voters stayed at home. 
Despite The choice on election day, simply put, was between the past performance of one fallible man and the unproved promises of another. 
Those who believed Gallup and Harris knew all along that the outcome was never in doubt; we knew that yesterday's bosses in the labor movement did not like George McGovern; that white Southerners, whith the Wallace option shot away, would go to Nixon; that the wealthy, worried about taxes, would do the same; that the middle class saw safer streets under Nixon; that newly discovered white ethnics wanted to crack down on ] 2 dissenters and de deserters; that college students, as a general rule, cannot stick to anything over a prolonged period of time, and that almost no one could be found identifiable political bloc could be found—except for Black people—to vote for the liberal candidates. 
If the election on November 7th illuminated any political movement at all, it was the movement of the comfortable, the callous and the smug, closing their hearts and closing their ranks against the claims and calls to conscience put forward by the forgotten and unrepresented elements in American society. 
Despite all of the charges about the Watergate, the wheat deal rip-off, the milk deal, the ITT scandal, the last minute peace Kissinger initiateive, McGovern's vacillations and Eagleton's prevarications, the central issue in was clear: as the Reverend Jesse Louis Jackson put it, ""It wasn't the bus, 
2
it was us"". 
""Race,"" the New York Times-Yankelovich poll concluded on November ] 3 6th ""has been a dirty little secret that is neaith neither little nor secret but central to current politics."" 
4 out of ten voters said minority groups had received ""too much"" attention. This after four years of officially sponsored ""benign neglect."" On the series of issues that mean race to too many Americans—welfare, job quotas, education in crisis, crime and urban blight—one candidate took the low road while the other took the high. 
The result was a unique national election, with one candidate receiving nearly all of the Black votes cast, and the other candidate receiving nearly three quarters of the white votes cast. 
That doesn't describe a the standard contest between Democrats and Republicans, or event a race between two men named Nixon and McGovern—this was rather a national referendum on what has more politly been called ""the social issue."" 
Paraenthetically, the New York Times said that ""race"" and not ] 4 ""racism"" was the issue—I fail to understand the distinction. 
For Black people in American, the results of that contest signaled consigning nearly all our hopes and dreams to an oblivion from which they may never emerge. It meanth re-installing in power those who believe in privilege for the powerful and neglect of the powerless. It meant rewarding regression, applauding alienation, and boosting bigotry. 
It meant giving a four year free hand to men who have demonstrated they have no concern for freedom of the press, for privacy of the individual, or for the constitutionally guaranteed civil rights and civil liberties we should all like to believe are taken for granted by those who govern us. It mean extending the lease on Uncle Strom's Cabin, and making malignant what had been merely benign.

The president's th[ree] was asked the public for four more years, and got them. These are his years, years to use as he chooses. He may use them to put new faces on the Supreme Court, to turn it back into the activist liberal force it used to be, or continue its current trend toward facism regression. ] 5
He will continue to name the directors, to set the policies or to and emasculate the budgets of the Department of Health, Education and Welfare, the Department of Housing and Urban Development, and the Federal Bureau of Investigation. 
He will decide whether stocks go up or down, whether money is loose or tight, whether w our weekly paychecks buy more or less or whether we have any paychecks at all. 
He has got four years in which to to shape America to his mould, to recruit from the frightened a constituncy against the forgotten.

Throughout this period, or our situation worsens. Over the last four past years, we spent billions more on war, over 6 two million more Americans were added to the ranks of the unemployed, two 6 million more are on ever mounting relief rolls, inflation has reduced our standard of living. 
A quick look at all of the facts and figures that demonstrates how well—or how poorly—a group of people are doing, the kinds of figures ] 6 that measure median family income, life expectancy, infant mortality—demonstrates rather clearly that while the average Black American is certainly better off than his father was, he is in some perverse fashion actually worse off when his statistics are compared to similar ones for white people. 
Our children are now being denied necessicities orur grandparents never dreamed ef existed. 
It is almost as though we are climbing a molasses mountain dressed in snowshoes, while white American ride a rather leisurely ski lift to the top. 
[On the verso of page three is the following content, apparently a rejected draft of the speech's opening paragraphs. It is struck through with a large X.]
The quadrennial occassion for American reaction or affirmation at the ballot box is now several months old.
Reaction won was reinforced on November 7th, and we now suffer for it.
That election was an unusual one in the American contests context - it marked the end of a progressive coalition that had lasted since Franklin Roosevelt
4
Part of the difficulty of conceiving a solution to our problem is that we have believed too strongly in the American aspiration of one chicken per pot and a piece of the chicken farm too. 
The increase in the late sixties and early seventies of interest in briar-patch capitalism and inequitable entrepreneurship overshadowed ] 7 the undeniable fact that we are a working people, numbers of a class delineated by both the twin torments of race and economic circumstance, held at the bottom by these twin torments and that we need more jobs for mom and pop, not more mom and pop stores. 
We are a little more than 11% of the total population, and in 1970 were 10% of the employed population. 
But wWe were only 5% of the engineers, 1% of the physicians and dentists, 3% of the managers and administrators, 6% of the craftsmen and foremen, 6% of the mechanics and repairmen, but were 52% of the private household workers, 19% of the farm workers, and 20% of the general category laborers. 
We are primarily lowly paid non-industrial workers then, traditionally in marginal employment, existing on the fringe of the American economy. 
It might be instructive here to reflect on some words from a speech delivered in January by the elder statesman of the Black movement, Roy Wilkin Wilkins: Wilkins. Speaking on the question of jobs, Mr. Wilkins said: ] 8
[The following are revision instructions for the next version of the speech, circled in green pen.] include material between green lines on page 5 and 6 Wilkins quote
6 5
[Green lines appear here as mentioned in the previous revision instructions.]
""Nothing is more crucial to our general welfare and the tranquility of our country than full employment, decent, meaningful jobs for all who are able and willing to work. Yet our unemployment rate is still 5.2 per cent. Unemployment for minorities is at least double that, and for ghetto youths the rate is 40-50 per cent. Instead of fostering programs that could help lower unemployment, the Administration seems bent on cutting back on existing job programs. Budget economy dictates deep cuts in federal jobs. We are told to expect cuts in manpower training programs and the Job Corps. Is this really the way, one wonders, to strengthen the ""work ethic""? 
If many people are out of work, millions who do work are underpaid. Yet in the last Congress, the Administration did little or nothing to support the efforts of Leadership Conference organizations on Civil Rights to raise the federal minimum wage to at least $2 an hour and extend coverage, most notably, to domestic workers. Indeed, the Administration sought to ] 9 undermine even that modest increase by advocating a subminimum for youths 18 and under, a proposal that would almost certainly result in these young people displacing their ill-paid fathers. 
What does this Administration offer to those who cannot work? Or those who need help in finding their way to self-supporting lives? Welfare reform appears to be dead. The Office of Economic Opportunity, whose best programs have already been pruned, is being turned over to leadership that seems bent on hacking its programs further, reducing its staff and virtually liquidating dismembering it. An effective child care program, a casualty already of a presidential veto, will face a hard fight in this Congress, too. Commenting on where we are today, the New York Times observed recently: ""The reform of any program for the betterment of the
6
human condition is now in danger of falling victim to the reactionary paranoia that sees all the poor as chiselers or criminals. Waste is to be tolerated only in defense contracts and to bail out mismanaged ] 10 corporations. But fear of waste is enough to veto essential measures for the care of children, the elderly or the poor.""* 
* footnote
[Green lines appear here as mentioned in the previous revision instructions.]
There is a terrible cicularity to our situation.
Under the Constitution, all of our children are entitled to an equal educational opportunity and the courts have held that is possible only if our schools are desegregated. But the President is against busing, or ""forced busing"" as he calls it, even those instances where busing is the only available means of desegregating our schools. He is, he says, for neighborhood schools. Now neighborhood schools can be desegregated only if the neighborhoods are integrated. But the President opposes any use of federal power to require neighborhoods to be open to everyone, particularly those who may be poor. Integrated neighborhoods, he says, will come about voluntarily as minority people earn enough to move out of the inner city ghettos. To earn enough to move into decent homes, however, people must have decent jobs. But the President opposes cease-and-desist powers to strengthen the Equal Employment Opportunities Commission in its fights against discrimination; he decrees cuts in federal job training programs; he has opposed and vetoed bills that would create more and better opportunities for employment. Well, he says, people will move up through education; only the Adminstration works to deny them full educational opportunities. And so the vicious circle is complete.

Mr. Wilkins' assessment is moderate in tone, but righteously radical in its condemnation of th an administration where public policy is guided by the politics of wealth and stealth.

Manpower Inclusion

of the Urban League have shown this nation that with equal opportunity, Black people can carry their our weight. As a result of your efforts, thousands of Black people are now in the mainstream of the American economy. And what are your rewards? President Nixon and his administration, in a feeble attempt to allude to following the dictates of the ""mandate"" of the last election, has have decided that all Manpower training efforts will be a part of Revenue Sharing which will be ] 11 controlled and administered by local and state governments. Why now, after the many years of failure by existing these same government agencies entities? The answer is simple. You have provided equal opportunity for Black people in employment and Black people have responded affirmatively. Congress passed the Emergency Employment Act and in excess orf 35% of the people hired under this Act were Black people— and it has turned out to be the greatest activity of its kind since the WPA. You have cracked the great white wall of the Union dynasties racism + hostility and as a result of your efforts, more Blacks are now marching working side by side with whites in those new employment areas. You have overcome adversitiesy and overwhelming odds and made Manpower activities fruitful and beneficial and for this you are penalized. The administration says that local governments will make Manpower decisions from now on. Even as of this date, cities and , counties, and ] 12 states all over the nation have received the their funding levels for Manpower Revenue Sharing. How many of you have been included as a recipient of those funds or have been asked for your input and the utilization of your expertise? With this recent turn of events you have a challenge that encompasses Manpower activities as well as all other activities that affect our future.

Reversing this recession of political concern must be part of your agenda for the remainder of the '70s. 
As people involved in social action, as professionsals whose skills and hopes and aspirations are daily frustrated by insensitive government and a hostile public,, you know what must be done. 
Nearly one-half century ago, Dr. W. E. B. DuBois described the plight Black people increasingly face. He said then: 
[The following quote is stapled onto the page, and then crossed out with a hand-drawn X.]
""It is,"" he said, ""as though one looking out from a dark cave in the side of a mountain sees the world passing and speaks to it; ] 13 speak courteously and persuasively, showing them how these entombed souls are hindered in their natural movement, expression and development, and how their loosening from prison would be a matter not simply of courtesy, sympathy and help to them, but all the world. One talks on evenly and logically in this way but notices that the passing throng does not even turn its head, or if it does, glances curiously and walks on. It gradually penetrates the minds of the prisoners that the people passing by do not hear; that some thick sheet of invisible but horribly tangible plate glass is between them and the world. They get excited; they talk loudedr; they gesticulate. Some of the passing world stop in curiousity; these gesticulations seem so pointless; they laugh and pass on. They still either do not hear at all, or hear but dimly, and even when they hear, they do not understand. Then the people within may become hysterical. They may scream and hurl themselves against the barriers, hardly realizing in their ] 14 bewilderment that they are screaming in a vacuum unheard and that their antics may seem funny to those outside looking in. They may even, here and there, break through in blood and disfigurement, and find themselves faced by a haorroified, implacable and quite overwhelming mob of people frightened for their own very existence.""
What is the condition the the concept of welfare was founded for, first to hide the forgotten out of sight and mind; then to maintain them at minimal cost to society, and today, it seems, to destroy any ability they may have to improve their own condition.

states all over the nation have received their funding levels for manpower revenue sharing. How many of you have been included as a recipient of those funds or have been asked for your input and the utilization of your expertise? With this recent turn of events you have a challenge that encompasses manpower activities as well as all other activities that affect our future. 
Reversing this recession of political concern must be part of your agenda for the remainder of the seventies. 
As people involved in social action, as professionals whose skills and hopes and aspirations are daily frustrated by insensitive government and a hostile public, you know what must be done. 
Nearly one half century ago, Dr. W.E.B. DuBois described the plight Black people increasingly face. He said then: 
""It is,"" he said, ""as though one, looking out from a dark cave in the side of a mountain, sees the world passing and speaks to it; 
13
speak courteously and persuasively, showing them how these entombed souls are hindered in their natural movement, expression and development, and how their loosening from prison would be a matter not simply of courtesy, sympathy and help to them, but all the world. One talks on evenly and logically in this way but notices that the passing throng does not even turn its head, or if it does, glances curiously and walks on. It gradually penetrates the minds of the prisoners that the people passing by do not hear; that some thick sheet of invisible but horribly tangible plate glass is between them and the world. They get excited; they talk louder; they gesticulate. Some of the passing world stop in curiousity; these gesticulations seem so pointless: they laugh and pass on. They still either do not hear at all, or hear but dimly, and even when they hear, they do not understand. 
Then the people within may become hysterical. They may scream and hurl themselves against the barriers, hardly realizing in their 
14
bewilderment that they are screaming in a vacuum unheard and that their antics may seem funny to those outside looking in. They may even, here and there, break through in blood and disfigurement, and find themselves faced by a horrified, implacable and quite overwhelming mob of people frightened for their own very existence."" 
That is our condition. Together, we must continue the battle to see it improve.

We are where we are today because of a confluence of events of the sixties. The nonviolent marchers of the first part of that decade were replaced - if not in fact, then certainly in the public fancy - by the rapacious rioters of the last part of the '60s.
America's cities were believed to be either in flames, under martial law, or sinking under the dead weight of a population of pensioners, the unemployed young t and their presumably unemployable parenats.
The rest of America was running from the city in a crisis state of their own. They rightly perceived that their taxes - higher proportionately than those payed by ITT - were escalating to pay for barely maintaining what they had run away from, but were wrongly taught - by their president and others - that their taxes were high because of the lazy poor, and ] 4 not because of the corporate evader or the military glutton.
The rulers of the cities, on the other hand - the mayors, commissioners and councilmen - faced an all too common list of plagues we have come to call the urban crisis - drug addiction, increased racial friction, civil service militancy, housing destroyed by plan ""A"" faster than it was constructed by plan B; schools which warehoused and miseducated their students, relief rolls giving relief to no one - for them the new federalism promised to be manna from heaven.
It promised new money for them all, money to do what they then could not, money to pave the streets, to pay the police, to clean the air and water.
Instead of manna and millions, it because became pennies stolen from the poor, robbing peter to pay paul half of what peter couldn't get by on to begin with. 
The result was to shift the burden from the Federal Government where the resources were to the towns and cities where the resources aren't. ] 5 
The municipal managers, forced to choose between funding underfunded program X or Y, chose more ft often than not to buy votes at the expense of the public good. with tax rebates and fancy hardware.
The Administration's rhetoric about sharing the wealth became a scandolous exercise in consolidating wealth and pover where they always were; away from the cities, away from children, away from people for whom wealth is an extra meal, and power the ability to hide from the census taker.

The often repeated connection between today's dilemna is and the end of Reconstruction era is frightening.
The collusion between a hostile administration and a seemingly un-feeling majority - then and now - seemed to doom the hope of the American underclass.
Then and now, a president desparate for power made an arrangemnet - not just with the unreconstructed South, but with the national ] 6 un-reconstructed mentality that believes now - as it did then - that private profit and public arrogance could be pursued at the expense of the people living on the American margin.
Concurrently, the liberal crusaders for social justice and democracy became tired, or involved in other, less traumatic concerns . [A handwritten circle indicates pulling a later paragraph to this location. The editors have transcribed the content in the indicated order.] ttheir outrage, guilt and indignation receding as the dark plague came closer to the liberal hearth and home.
The aspirations of and movement by black people began to be curtailed, not just by organized violence and barbarity, but by a series of national choreographed legal and extra-leganl manuevers designed to make us less than political and economic eguals;
The frenetic activity of the sixties created a political movement characterized by selfishness and fear; a political constituency was recruited from the frightened to form solid ranks against the forgotten. ] 7
Backlash is too hackneyed a term for people confused by long hair and frightened by clenched fists, their politics misdirected by those who verbally oppose crime in streets and secretly practice crime in the suites.
This manipulation of the American mind made the mundane magnificent and placed government in the hands of men who believe in priviledge for the powerful and neglect of the powerless.
I can think of no better prescription for relieving the urban crisis - and reviving interest in it - than by creating a partisan national coalition of need, of mothers who want care - not warehousing - for their children, of fathers who want work at a decent wage, of people who work for a living but can't find live on what they make as well as those who can't find work but can't live on what we grudgininggly give, those who want an end to welfare capitalism for the poor and subsidy and socialism for the wealthy, [A handwritten circle indicates pulling a later paragraph to this location. The editors have transcribed the content in the indicated order.] and who must learn that sufficiency for people at the ] 8 bottom doesn't can also mean progress stability for those in the middle - all those people live now in our cities, divided now by race and class, d fearful of each other, contentious and impotent.
The task becomes one of making the congressional elections of next year turn on committment to the cities. The conferees gathered here come from tho the American metropolis, are represented in Congress - with rare exception - by men and women whose committments are to an earlier era in American history, when farm and field were represented more than alley and expressway.

The heartening victory on Tuesday night of Tom Bradley in Los Angeles shows that a racially mixed electorate, when faced with a choice between rational planning for the future offered by one candidate and extremist charges and diversionary tactics offered by the other, will opt for reason, thought and care, and will repudiate ugliness and fear. ] 9

[The following sentence is the intended inserted material.] insert A few weeks ago, the strong campaign put forth by Bobby Seale in Oakland showed that more and more, voters want candidates with programs and not just promises.
Last November, while the District of Columbia and the free thinking state of Massachusetts were saving us from total embarrasment, the voters of the 5th Congressional District of Georgia, mostly white, a combination of uneasy urbanities and satisfied suburban dwellers, chose an agressive, young Black congressman who over a candidate who argued for more of the same and business as usual.
In the 19702 congressional elections, those Americans who longed for cleaner air and water aimed their sights at members of the U. S. House who placed profits over human pleasure and cleaned house. During most of last year, those forces in America who wanted day care legislation passed massed their power and saw it through both house of Congress - only to be thrwarted by presidential veto, and give up the ghost. ] 10
[A handwritten circle indicates pulling a later paragraph to this location. The editors have transcribed the content in the indicated order.]
Through the late sixties, a movement - lead largely by the young - made the war an issue of public consciousness, forced a sitting president to retire, and reversed the thinking of nearly one-half of the American electorate.
But this task is too great for summer soldiers and single issue agitators.
There must be a confluence of all these forces from now on. ButTthe forces that want clean air ought not support a man with a dirty heart. Those of us who applaud a congressman who is right on peace ought not vote for another him if he's wrong on highways. If your Senator is wrong on welfare and right on rivers, make him right on welfare too.
It will mean developing an interest outside the narrow concern of prefession.
Building such a movement is an old and rather faded dream - its chances of success have never been easy, its difficulties have always been great immense, but its urgency has never been greater.
We are lead by a government whose highest members stand accused of ""wire tapping, theft, burglary, breaking and entering, perjury, ] 11 malfeasance in office suborning testimony, bribery, forgery, obstruction of justice, v- various forms of conspiracy and numerous violations of campaign finance and election laws"" which were ""planned, committed, conived at, condoned or covered up as high at the topr of the as we may dare to believe."" 1
The power which will steal the right to work from work - eager mothers thinks nothing of stealing records from a doctor's office; an attorney general who will lie under oath thinks notnhing of conspiring with those who don't want Black and white kids to go to school learn truth together; a president who harbors conspirators in his bosom readily agrees to conspire to deprive the war wounded of relief, the welfare ridden of minimal affluence, and the aged of simple security.
These men are aided by a congress either unwilling or impotent, state legislators suddenly called upong to spend moneys they haven't got for programs they didn't know existed, mayors and city officials unable ] 12 to decide whether revenue is to be shared with those who have none or those who have it all.
The National Urban Coalition has pulled together an unusualg group of black and brown people, urban white ethnics, corporate and labor leaders, people of different background, income, belief and culture, to make plans t and plot strategy for making the American city a thing of beauty and a joy to live in.
But until that coalition becomes a living force at the American ballot box, its plans will be written in sand and shifted by the changing seas.
Until you can make your representatives in city hall and county courthouse, in the halls of congress and the fortress of the white house, act as though they believed that you are serious about what you discuss here, then the problem crisis will continue to mount and every American city will move closer to becoming the urban Atticas too many already are. ] 13
There has already been established a circular route from politics to protest to revolt. Tom Hayden spelled it out best some years ago when he wrote: 
[The following are revision instructions.] bond book, hayden quote in full, page 58
If the political agitation in Oakland, the sporadic and all to infrequent political contests waged by those who were in the streets some years ago mean anyt hing at all, it is that the circle has come 'round again.
The political process is being put to a test, not as a last ditch effort, but as another weapon in an arsenal that has contained more pop guns than howitzers.
The politics of protest of the sixties found that publically supported inequality at the lunch counter or bus station would yeild - after a struggle - bot but the anti more sophisticated, institutianalized inequality of the '70s will not.
As the American city quickly becomes ""a reservation for the unwanted"" - most of whom are black"" 2 it must fight back with the limited resources at its command.
Those resources are few, and amount to bodies who have votes.
Those votes - put together with the votes of those who say they care - can begin to make a dent in the reservation wall, to let money, and sunshine, and air and life inside. ] 16
That begins to defuse the urban crisis, to make a look at tomorrow more possible.
Those of you who expect some your problem to be magically solved, had best take a cue from something Frederick Douglass said 100 years ago:
[The following are revision instructions.] bond book, pg 24 Douglass quote in all
[The following handwritten content labeled ""insert"" is likely intended for the first page.]

In the decade of the '60s, the number of people living in poverty was nearly halved.
It's not unreasonable at all to ascribe these some of these gains to the Great Society programs of the era.
Yet the callous castrators moved in with cold calculation to kill, freeze or wind down urban renewal, model cities, community action, public service employment, student loans, public housing, federal impact funds for education, and to impose a 60% national pull-back in social services.
Human problems are placed on a balance sheet and forced to add up - to pay for themselves. The new administrators run the programs they direct with the solicitude of a hungry mortician at an old folks home.

It is now nearly six months since election day when the coalition of the comfortable, the callous and the smug - closed its ranks - and closed its heart - to the claims and calls to conscience put forward by the forgotten and unrepresented elements in American society.
It's a year and more since a coalition of organizations, of mothers on welfare and mothers who fare well, of Head Start contituents, teachers parents, and national organizations with an interest in children had their hopes dashed by presidential veto, their chance - a for federally financed day care centers dashed flicked away with the stroke of a pen.
That blow, followed by a series of moves from the White House - with the impotent acquiesence of the Congress - have had the general effect of cutting social services as high as 60% in some states.
I As always, the vetos, cut backs, shifts in sharing and reverses in revenue cut sharpest at the people at the bottom, those who look to government for help.
[Typeset.]
As that is true in the poverty program generally, it is true in child care.
[This page has hand-marked circles and arrows indicating the intended order of paragraphs, which the editors have represented here.]
According to the Black Child Development Institute, ""high percentages of the Black children now being served by day care centers would no longer be eligible for such services. Wilson Riles, State Superintendent of Public Instruction for California estimates that 11,000 of the 19,000 children now being served would lose their eligibility, while the greater Minneapolis Day Care Association foresees 60% of their children being declared ineligible. Governor Dale Bumbers of Arkansas expects the loss opf 82 centers in his state, and House Majority Leader Tip O'Neill estimates that the new (HEW) regulations would force closure of a quarter of the day care centers in Massacusetts."" 1
This whole issue cuts more closely to the grain, when the parents and ] 3 children are both non-white and poor. 10% more married Black mothers with children are in the labor force than are white mothers. 10% more widowed or divored Black mothers work. Median income for working Black mothers is nearly $1000 less than their white counterparts. Infant mortality figures are nearly twice as high for Blacks than whites. The accident and illness death rates for the children of the dispossed are almost twice as high as for the children of those more fortunate.
The Kennedy and Johnson years taught the lesson that government - under pressure - would move, slowly and ponderously, toward all too often with all deliberate lack of speed - to become a partner of sorts with the American underclass in their struggle to do better for themselves.
The last five years have changed all that. The government's attitude has changed from benign concern to malignant neglect.
All of today's difficulties stem from a concurring confluence of events of the sixties. The marchers of the first part of that decade were replaced - if not in fact, then certainly in the public fancy - by the rioters of the last part of the sixties.
America's cities were either in flames, under martial law, or sinking under the dead weight of a population of pensioners, aged and retired if they are white un- or underemployed, generally if they are Black or Brown and certainly poor, probably working only sporadically or not at all if they did, barely floating between at the poverty level.
The rest of America - those who insured us last November that they wanted four more years - ran from the city in a crisis state of their own. They rightly perceived that their taxes - higher proportionately than those paid by [IIT] ITT - were escalating to pay for barely maintaining what they had run away from, but wrongly believed - and were taught by their President - that the taxes were raised high because because of the lazy poor, and not ] 5 because of the greedy rich, the corporate evader, the military gluttons.
The rulers of the cities, on the other hand- the mayors and councilmen, the governors of the states, the legislators who decide whether they city will grow or recede - face a now too common list of blights we have come to call the urban crisis - drug addiction, militancy by their civil service employees servants, housing destroyed by plan A faster than it is built by plan B, rampant criminality, relief rolls swollen and giving no relief to no one the general failure of the systems to produce lievable circumstances - for them the new federalism was manna from Heaven.
It promised new money for them all, new money to do what they hthen could not, new money to pave the streets, to pay the police, to clear the air and water.
Instead it becam of manna and millions, it became pennies stolen from the poor, robbing Peter to pay Paul half of what Peter couldn't get by on to begin with. The infrastructure of the poverty program - employing the ] 6 unemployable as well as the middle managers whose expertise put plan into motion - became are becoming unemployed themselves.
The result has been to shift the burden from the Federal Government where the resources are, to the states and localities, where the resources aren't. The rulers of the cities and states, forced to choose between ending polution above ground and eliminating the pollution of people at earth level tend to lean toward the dramatic, eye catching and vote getting proposals that appeal to a law and order constituency, determined to put real walls between them and the great unwashed.
The President's rhetoric about sharing the wealth has been merely and excuse exercise in consolidating wealth and power where it always was - away from the cities, away from the children, away from the people for whom wealth is an extral meal, and power the ability to hide from the census taker.
The comparison between today's dilemna and the Reconstruction era are inescapable. ] 7
The collusion between a hostile President and a presently unfeeling majority - then as now - doomed the hopes of the American underclass.
Then and now, an American president made a cynical deal, not just with the un-Reconstructed South, but with the national un-Reconstructed mentality that believed then, as it believes now, that people without boots can pull themselves to solvency by their bootstraps.
Then, and now, the promises made that we would be included in American affluency were repudiated.
Instead, of then as now:
- the liberal crusaders for social justice and democracy became weary, or involved in other, less traumatic concerns;
- the aspirations of and movement by Black people began to be curtailed, not just by organized violence and brutality, buyt by a series of nationally coreographed legal and extra-legal manuevers designed to make us less than political and economic egquals. ] 8
- the hopes born of the early sixties that racial eqquality and social justice could be achieved through litigation, legislation, negotiation, alliances with centrist groups , were supplanted by dill disilusionment, bitterness, and increasingly, open anger;
- the guilt and heartfelt indignation of remote supporters of the Black push for eguality became changed as the Black tide moved closer to liberal home and hearth - changed to first cautious, and now open, hostility.
- The frenetic activity of the '60s created a political movement of characterized by selfishness and fear; a political constituency was recruited from the frightened to form solid ranks against the forgotten.
Backlash is too strong a term for people confused by long hair and clenched fists, their politics misdirected by those who verbally oppose crime in the streets and secretly practice crime in the suites.
The manipulation of the American mind results in made the mundane magnificent, ] 9 and placed government in the hands of men with a history of disinterest in no interest whatsoever in freedom of the press, the privacy of the individual, or the constitutionally guaranteed civil rights we should all like to believe are taken for granted by those who govern us. They believe in priviledge for the powerful and neglect of the powerless.
Reversing their recession of political concern is the first order of business for anyone interested in social progress in America.
Mounting a serious struggle against the kind of arraogant power that stretches from the corporate board room to the White House, the state house, city hall and county courthouse, requires more than just the partial presence of summer soldiers and single issue agitators.
Among other things, it reguires the building of a an agressive, militant, democratic (with a small ""d"") political movement, with its roots in Black America, in coordination with all those others who are non-white and poor, in open ended coalition with all those others in this country ] 10 who are tired of the politics of wealth and stealth, all those who want an end to welfare and capitalism for the poor and subsidy and socialism for the rich, those wh people who work for a living and can't live on what they make as well as those who can't find work and can't live on what we so grudgingly give, if all those people can be made to work together and lobby together and vote together, they can create a political force in this country powerful enough to take control in a peaceful and orderly fashion, or to take control following the example of those who now exercise great power.
That is an immense task - last year's Presidential contest demonstrated that nearly half of the electorate thought it no more important than a change of photographs on the post office wall, or a change of faces on a fraternity house dart board.
There must be created a coalition of need, of mothers who want care ] 11 - not warehousing - for their children, of fathers who want work at a decent wage, of people who must be taught that safe streets do not mean detention at a judge's whim, ar and who must learn that progress sufficiency for people at the bottom will mean [illegible ys some] can mean progress for those in the middle, but ought not mean rip-offs for those at the top.
That means developing an interest outside the narrow concerns of profession and developing an agressive national coalition of people who want their livfe, liberty and happiness assured - not threatened - by their government.
For people from the center out to the left, there must be none of the niaevete that characterized the liberal thrust in '68 and '72, politics has never guaranteed instant eguality for anyone - it will give you a chance to have something to say about what happens to you - no more, no less.
Building such a movement is an old and rather faded dream - its chances of success have never been easy, but it is more urgent now than ever before.
We are lead by a government whose highest members are guilty at the ] 12 least of of ""wire tapping, theft, burglary, breaking and entering, perjury, malfeasance in office, suborning testimony, bribery, forgery, obstruction of justice, various forms of conspiracy and numerous violations of election and campaign finance laws"" which have been ""planned, committed, conived at, condoned or covered up"" as high at the top as we may dare to believe.
The power which will steal the right to work from working work-eager mothers thinks nothing of stealing records from a doctor's office; these who an attorney general who will lie under oath thinks nothing of conspiring with those who don't want black and white children to learn together or of Black people to vote at all; a President who harbors conspirators in his bosom thinks readily agrees to conspire to [threat] deprive the war wounded on relief, the welfare ridden of minimal affluence, and the aged of simple security.
These men are aided by a Congress unwilling to [work] or impotent, state legislators called upon to spend funds they haven't got for programs they didn't know until existed; mayors who either afraid or unable to push their vaunted ] 13 political power at their governors and congressmen to force a showdown between thr their own lack of program and the President's rule by veto executive order and impoundment.
Like me, they are all politicians. Like all politicians, they fear defeat. Like most politicians, they know you are so divided, contentious and single minded about your concern, that they have nothing to fear. Should you decide to engage in battle, take as your watchword some words from the past, from the late Dr. W. E. B. DuBois who said almost 70 years ago:
""I believe in God who made of one blood all the races that dwell on earth. I believe that all men, black and brown and white are brothers, varying, through time and opportunity, in form and gift and feature, but differing in no essential particular, and alike in soul and in the possibility of infinite development.
Especially do I believe in the Negro race; in the beauty of its genius, the sweetness of its soul, and its strength in that meekness which shall ] 14 inherit this turbulent earth.......
I believe in the Prince of Peace. I believe that war is murder. I believe that armies and navies are at bottom the tinsel and braggadacio of oppression and wrong; and I believe that the weaker wicked conguest of weaker and darker nations by nations white and stronger but foreshadows the death of their strength.
I believe in liberty for all men; the space to stretch their arms and their souls; ther right to breathe and the right to vote, the freedom to choose their friends, enjoy the sunshine and ride on the railroads, uncursed by color; thinking, dreaming, working as they will in a kingdom of God and love.""2"

Julian Bond
To the members of the class of 19713:
It is traditional at a ceremony like this one to tell you that you are embarking on a great journey through an uncharted sea steering with the compass of your education, sailing under sails raised by your own brilliance, but that, however difficult your course, you are to remember that we are all of us - Black and white, rich and poor - all in the same boat. That may be true, but it's leaking under Black people's seat.
You are about to leave here at a time of social and moral turmoil. You are entering into the real world outside of these Ebony Towers at an interesting time. # 1 insert #1 The government of the most powerful nation on earth is suspect. The administration that wanted four more years now wants two off with good behavior.
You are the spiritual descendants of those young people who eleven thirteen years ago, coming from schools very much like this one, demonstrated that young people could make a difference, first at lunch counters and bus stations,
2 2
then at County Courthouses and voting booths all over the dark nether regions of the country.
Throughout the decade of the sixties, young people the age most of you are now, faced police dogs and fire hoses and midnight murderers and jails in order to bring a small taste of democracy to this region of the country.
We find ourselves in a different era now.
insert #2
insert #2The tragedy of the Watergate is not that the Presidency stands cheapened by the pious po protestors who publically preach against crime in the streets and privately practice crime in the suites. The damage done is not to the functioning of the political process of the uni-party system - these techniques of forgery, bribery, wiretapping, suborning, breaking and entering, testimony, burglary, theft and conspiracy have been decided, directed planned, committed, conived at, condoned and covered up by ] 3 a succession of American governments under a variety of presidents belonging to each of the parties.
The tragedy is that evil once practiced on despised minorities by a a an arrogant majority are now practiced by segments of the majority on each other.

The trouble is that many people talk about revolution, but do nothing about it: they talk about reform, but do nothing about it.
We live in an age where social activism is measured by whether one wears the right button or can engage in intricate handshakes or can mouth the latest slogan - even President Nixon can say ""power to the people.""
You are, in a way certified by your graduation today, becoming citizens of the larger world, but of course we are citizens only in the narrow sense in that we must meet certain obligations to the state, without receiving all of the corresponding benefits of citizenship. ] 4 We all pay taxes, but because more of us are poor,
4 4
and because the poor pay more, and because some of the rich pay nothing, we pay more of our share for less of the rewards most taxpayers rightfully expect.
Black and white young men alike are were subjected to the nearly equal opportunity to serve this country militarily, but through this present attack by our country on the innocent people of Southeast Asia, we have our young men managed to become first in war, last in peace, and seldom in the hearts of our countrymen.
While we - like most other Americans - came here as immigrants, but most immigrants came voluntarily, seeking freedom and a chance to survive , . Our ancestors came in chains, husband torn from wife, child from mother.
In a land where family and education are venerated, we were denied the chance to learn and to maintain what presently passes for a stable family unit. In a country populated with sufferers frmom

] 5 religious persecution, we found a strange and alien religion forced upon us.
While we came from a land whose inhabitants believed in communalism and the extended family, we found created here a system of mercantile capitalism that exactly fitted the cash box mentality of the founding fathers.
From that day to this, the separate status of Black people here has been a fact. From that day to this, we have been the Africans, suffering at the hands of the Europeans.
The argument is also made that the Blacks enjoy legal status here as do all Americans. Of course, on paper, that is largely true, but the plain facts are that certain constitutionally guaranteed rights, like the right to vote and to enjoy other forms of social and political participation, are still subjected to intense debate, not only in the Southern states but even here in Washington, in Uncle Strom's
6 6
Cabin itself.
In short, we are in bad shape. We live and work in situations provided for by the majority, not by us. We exist at the pleasure and sufferance of the American majority, and the evidence is mounting that that existence itself may soon be called into question.
Your job is to ignore the foolish preoccupations that have captured the attention of many of your white long-haired contemporaries. You cannot afford to attend celebrate a Woodstock while the nation still tolerates Watts. You cannot afford to show more interest in macrobiotic diets, in music, drugs, the relative revisionism of the late Ho Chi Minh, the romantic rhetoric of revolution and the enobling sacrifice of self-enforced poverty than you do in the very real problems of human existence that afflict most Black people in this country.
Your job is to make real the revolutions that are sweeping around us. The first is a revolution in thinking about ourselves, a revolution ] 7 turning upside down the perverse analysis that has
7 7
made us - the victims - describe ourselves as the cause of our own condition.
It is a revolution found most concretely in the growing desire among Black people to reject the kind of tribalization of class and geography that has divided us for so long, and it is found in the impulse to bring us together as a nation within this nation.
It is found in the rejection by Black people of European standards of beauty and qualification that have plagued us for so long.
Making this real is your job. You graduation today is supposed to signify your entrance into the world where real decisions are made.
Since people of color have never been involved in decision making at this level, your role is to continue and heighten the empowerment of Black people begun in the sixties by young people like you.

Black people will increasingly do that through the political process, a process that determines who gets how much of what from whom.

8 There has already been established a circular route from politics to protest to revolt. Tom Hayden spelled it out best some years ago when he wrote:
""The people with fewest illusions about the welfare state are the poor who are served by it. When they protest, usually in the name of American ideals, an interesting reaction follows. Some among the majority react sympathetically, though not always with real understanding of the causes. But a sufficient number of opposing interests are aroused to prevent any drastic change, and often even moderate changes are blocked. The poor, who in most cases begin by politely petitioning their governors, soon take more drastic steps, thinking they can perhaps awaken the conscience of the majority or at least of higher authorities. They do awaken the consciences of some people, and to some extent they force elites to concede token changes. But at the same time, a ""counter-revolution"" is triggered against the potential of revolution which has
14 10
9 been seen in the mounting protest. The system becomes deadlocked. No more than token reforms, crumbs, result for the protesters. The scale of their protest increases as they realize that appeals to conscience are inadequate. They look for methods of transcending the pressure politics that have not worked. They begin civil disobedience and disruption. The immediate reaction of the power structure is to maintain order. The police are brought into the conflict. Considerations of social, political or economic solutions to the conflict are gradually replaced by the emphasis on law and order. Violent repression becomes routine.1
If the political agitation in Oakland, the sporadic and all-too-infrequent political contests waged by those who were in the streets some years ago mean anything at all, it is that the circle has come round again.
15 10
The political process is being put to a test, not as a last ditch effort, but as another weapon in an arsenal that has contained more pop guns than howitzers.
The politics of protest of the sixties found that publicly supported inequality at the lunch counter or bus station would yield - after a struggle - but the more sophisticated, institutionalized inequality of the seventies will not.
As the American city quickly becomes a ""reservation for the unwanted - most of whom are Black""2 it must fight back with the limited resources at its command.
Those resources are few, and amount to bodies who have votes.
Those votes - put together with the votes of those who say they care - can begin to make a dent in the reservation wall, to let money, and sunshine, and air and life inside.
16 11
That begins to defuse the urban crisis explosive crisis we face, to make ] 11 a look at tomorrow more possible.
Those of you who expect your problem to be magically solved, had best take a cue from something Frederick Douglass said 100 years ago:
""He who would be free must strike the first blow. You know that liberty given is never so precious as liberty sought for and fought for. The man who is outraged is the man who must make the first outcry. Depend on it, men will not care much for a people who do not care for themselves. Men will organize to prevent cruelty to animals, for they are dumb creatures, and cannot speak for themselves, but we are men, and men must speak for themselves or we shall not be spoken for at all. We hold it self evident that no class or color should be the exclusive rulers of this country. If there is a ruling class, there must boe of couse a subject class, and when that condition is established, the government of the people, by the people and for the people will perish from the earth.""

Mr President: members of the class of '73:

It is now nearly six months since election day when the coalition of the comfortable, the callous, and the smug, closed its ranks and closed its heart - to the claims and calls to conscience put forward by the forgotten and unrepresented elements in American society.
It is a year and more since a coalition of organizations, of mothers on welfare and mothers who fare well, of head start constituents, teachers, parents and state and national organizations with an interest in children had their hopes dashed by presidential veto, their chance for federally financed day care centers flicked away with the stroke of a pen.
That blow, followed by a series of moves from the White House - with the impotent acquiesce of the Congress - have had the general effect of cutting social services as high as sixty percent in some states.
As always, the vetoes, cut backs, shifts in sharing and reverses in revenue cut sharpest at the people at the bottom, those who look to government for help.
3
children are both non-white and poor. Ten percent more married Black mothers with children are in the labor force than are white mothers. Ten percent more widowed or divorced Black mothers work. Median income for working Black mothers is nearly $1,000 less than their white counterparts. Infant mortality figures are nearly twice as high for Blacks than whites. The accident and illness death rates for the children of the dispossessed are almost twice as high as for the children of those more fortunate.
The Kennedy and Johnson years before taught the lesson that government - under pressure - would move, slowly and ponderously, all too often with all deliberate lack of speed - to become a partner of sorts with the American underclass in their struggle to do better for themselves.
The last five years have changed all that. The government's attitude has changed from benign concern to malignant neglect.
The presidential - Indeed, governmental - attitude toward child care is merely an indication of its attitude toward others, who like children, are anyone unable to adequately speak for and represent themselves.
4
All of today's difficulties stem from a confluence of events of the sixties, the marchers of the first part of that decade were replaced - if not in fact, then certainly in the public fancy - by the rioters of the last part of the sixties.
America's cities were either in flames, under martial law, or sinking under the dead weight of a population of pensioners, aged and retired if they are white; un- or underemployed, if they are Black or brown and certainly poor, probably working only sporadically or not at all, and, if they did, barely floating at the poverty level.
The rest of America, those who insured us last November that they wanted four more years, ran from the city in a crisis state of their own. They rightly perceived that their taxes - higher proportionately than those paid by itt - were escalating to pay for barely maintaining what they had run away from, but wrongly believed - and were taught by their president - that the etaxes were high because of the lazy poor, and not
5
because of the greedy rich, the corporate evader, the military gluttons.
The rulers of the cities, on the other hand - the mayors and councilmen, the governors of the states, the legislators who decide whether the city will grow or recede, face a now too common list of blights we have come to call the urban crisis: drug addiction, militancy by their civil servants, housing destroyed by Plan A faster than it is built by Plan B. Rampant criminality, relief rolls swollen and giving relief to no one, the general failure of the system to produce livable circumstances. For them the new federalism was manna from heaven.
It promised new money for them all, new money to do what they then could not, new money to pave the streets, to pay the police, to clear the air and water.
Instead of manna and millions, it became pennies stolen from the poor, robbing Peter to pay Paul half of what Peter couldn't get by on to begin with. The infrastructure of the poverty program - employing the
6
unemployable as well as the middle managers whose expertise put plan into motion - are becoming unemployed themselves.
The result has been to shift the burden from the federal government where the resources are, to the states and localities, where the resources are not. The rulers of the cities and states, forced to choose between ending polution above ground and eliminating the pollution of people at earth level, tend to lean toward the dramatic, eye catching and vote getting proposals that appeal to a law and order constituency, determined to put real walls between them and the great unwashed.
The President's rhetoric about sharing the wealth has been merely an exercise in consolidating wealth and power where it always was: away from the cities, away from the children, away from the people for whom wealth is an extra meal, and power the ability to hide from the census taker.
The comparison between today's dilemma and the Reconstruction era are inescapable.
7
The collusion between a hostile president and a presently unfeeling majority - then as now - doomed the hopes of the American underclass.
Then as now, an American president made a cynical deal, not just with the un-reconstructed South, but with the national un-reconstructed mentality that believed then, as it believes now, that people without boots can pull themselves to solvency by their bootstraps.
Then, and now, the promises made that we would be included in American affluency were repudiated.
Instead, then as now:
- the liberal crusaders for social justice and democracy became weary, or involved in other, less traumatic concerns:
The aspirations of and movement by Black people began to be curtailed, not just by organized violence and brutality, but by a series of nationally choreographed legal and extra-legal manuevers to make us less than political and economic equals:
8
The hopes born of the early sixties that racial equality and social justice could be achieved through litigation, legislation, negotiation, alliances with centrist groups, were supplanted by disillusionment, bitterness, and increasingly, open anger:
The guilt and heartfelt indignation of remote supporters of the Black push for equality became changed as the Black tide moved closer to the liberal home and hearth: changed first to cautious, and now more open, hostility.
The frenetic activity of the sixties created a political movement characterized by selfishness and fear; a political constituency was recruited from the frightened to form solid ranks against the forgotten.
Backlash is too strong a term for people confused by long hair and clenched fists, their politics misdirected by those who verbally oppose crime in the streets and secretly practice crime in the suites.
The manipulation of the American mind made the mundane magnificant,
9
and placed government in the hands of men with a history of no interest whatsoever in freedom of the press, the privacy of the individual, or the constitutionally guaranteed civil rights we should all like to believe are taken for granted by those who govern us. They believe in privilege for the powerful and neglect of the powerless.
Reversing their recession of political concern is the first order of business for anyone interested in social progress in America.
Mounting a serious struggle against the kind of arrogant power that stretches from the corporate board room to the White House, the State House, City Hall and County Courthouse, requires more than just the partial presence of summer soldiers and single issue agitators.
Among other things, it requires the building of an aggressive, militant, democratic - small ""d"" - political movement, with its roots in Black America, in coordination with all those others who are nonwhite and poor the American underclass, in open ended coalition with all those others in this country
10
who are tired of the politics of wealth and stealth, all those who want an end to welfare and capitalism for the poor and subsidy and socialism for the rich, those people who work for a living and can't live on what they make as well as those who can't find work and can't live on what we so grudgingly give, if all those people can be made to work together and lobby together and vote together, they can create a political force in this country powerful enough to take control in a peaceful and orderly fashion, or to take control following the example of those who now exercise great power.
That is an immense task - last year's presidential contest demonstrated that nearly half of the electorate thought it no more important than a change of photographs on the post office wall, or a change of faces on a fraternity house dart board.
There must be created a coalition of need, or mothers who want care -
11
not warehousing - for their children, of fathers who want work at a decent wage, of people who must be taught that safe streets do not mean detention at a judge' whim, and who must learn that sufficiency for people at the bottom can also mean progress for those in the middle, but ought not mean rip-offs for those at the top.
That means developing an interst outside the narrow concerns of profession and developing a national coalition of people who want their life, liberty and happiness assured - not threatened - by their government.
For people from the center out to the left, there must be none of the naivete that characterized the liberal thrust in '68 and '72. Politics has never guaranteed instant equality for anyone. It will give you a chance to have something to say about what happens to you; no more, no less.
Building such a movement is an old and rather faded dream; its chances of success may never have been easy, its difficulties always great.
It may, or may not, succeed, but it is more urgent now than ever before.
We are lead by a government whose highest members are guilty at the
12
least of ""wire tapping, theft, burglary, breaking and entering, perjury, malfeasance in office, suborning testimony, bribery, forgery, obstruction of justice, various forms of conspiracy and numerous violations of campaign finance laws"" which have been ""planned, commited, connived at, condoned or covered up"" as high at the top as we may dare to believe.
The power which will steal the right to work from work--eager mothers thinks nothing of stealing records from a doctor's office; an Attorney General who will lie under oath thinks nothing of conspiring with those who don't want Black and white children to learn together or who doesn't don't want Black people to vote at all; a president who harbors conspirators in his bosom readily agrees to conspire to deprive the war wounded onf relief, the welfare ridden of minimal affluence, and the aged of simple security.
These men are aided by a Congress unwilling or impotent, state legislators called upon to spend funds they haven't got for programs they didn't know existed; mayors either afraid or unable to push their vaunted
13
political power at their governors and congressmen to force a showdown between their own lack of program and the president's rule by veto, executive order, and impoundment.
Like me, they are all politicians. Like all politicians, they fear defeat. Like most politicians, they know you the forces for progress and are so divided, contentious, and single minded about your their own concerns, that they believe they have nothing to fear. Should you decide to engage them in battle, take as your watchword some words from the past, from the late Dr. W. E. B. DuBois, who said almost seventy years ago:
""i believe in God who made of one blood all the races that dwell on earth. I believe that all men, Black and brown and white are brothers, varying through time and opportunity, in form and gift and feature, but differing in no essential particular, and alike in soul and in the possibility of infinite development.
Especially do I believe in the Negro race: in the beauty of its genius, the sweetness of its soul, and its strength in that meekness which shall
14
inherit the turbulent earth...
I believe in the Prince of Peace. I believe that war is murder. I believe that armies and navies are at bottom the tinsel and braggadacio of oppression and wrong; and I believe that the wicked conquest of weaker and darker nations by nations white and stronger but foreshadows the death of their strength.
I believe in liberty for all men: the space to stretch their arms and their souls; their right to breathe and the right to vote, the freedom to choose their friends, enjoy the sunshine and ride on the railroads, uncursed by color; thinking, dreaming, working as they will in a kingdom of God and love.""*

While there are some within the Democratic party who are now saying that these rules should be changed, it is my firm contention that these reforms are crucial to our party. We need them to insure a stronger party, representative of all people.
I want to speak particularly to Section A-1 and Section A-2 of the guidelines, which discuss ""reasonable representation"" in State delegations. This is, perhaps, the most important part of the guidelines, and with the affirmative action mandate, is that section which represents the most positive steps recently taken within the Democratic Party.
Reasonable representation means that all delegations to the National Convention must adequately represent different segments of a
2
states's population. It simply provides for all groups to have a chance to participate in the nomination of our President. It, in no way, means that a quota system be followed; in fact, the Commission guidelines as originally written make that point ""perfectly clear"". Incidentally, a successful challenge filed in this state before the Credentials Committee in 1972 was not based on imaginary quotas, as some party officials might have you believe, but on illegal manipulation by state party officials.
The whole phony issue of quotas is a smokescreen through which disgruntled losers in the 1972 delegate races are attempting to re-insert themselves once again into positions of dominance in the decision-making apparatus of the party. But the concept of providing fair representation is one that absolutely must remain a part of our rules.
In 1972, this guideline was often followed over zealously. Sections A-1 and A-2, with the general mandate on open and timely
3
selection of delegates, were operative for the first time in 1972. These guidelines allowed many new people to participate for the first time, people who had been trying for years to be active and were finally given the chance.
I believe we cannot afford to shut the door on new participants, having given them only one chance. Any reversal of the guidelines in these areas would effectively disenfranchise a segment within our party, and would signal a retreat to the ""boss"" dominated politics of yesterday.
I want also to talk for a moment about the Black participation, especially in the South. In providing for Black participation, the McGovern-Fraser guidelines were extremely important and effective. In 1968, Blacks made up only 5% of the delegates to the National Convention, but in 1972, 15% of the delegates were Black. Without the mandate of A-1 and A-2, this increase never would have been possible.
4
In every state in the South, the proportion of Blacks in state delegations increased substantially, but without the written provision for open and timely selection and without the mandate for fair representation, delegations from the South or, for that matter, many in the North as well, would not have been so well balanced.
Some have argued that by opening up the party to new activities, we have shut others out. But this is simply not so. Anyone and everyone was allowed and encouraged to participate in the nominating process last year; this was the major goal of the reforms. Some people chose not to work with the new rules, and many apparently did not want them to work at all.
Those same people also argue that the party needs to show more concern for the ""Loyal Democrats"". I would further point out that in the South, it is the Black population that is loyal to an extreme, bordering on slavishness.
5
In 1968, in Georgia, 63% of the Humphrey votes were produced by Black voters. Other Southern states bear out the same figures and the same was equally true for 1972. In both years, although the nominees were picked under different rules, only about 5-1/2 million people in the South voted Democratic, and the overwhelming majority of these votes were Black. This is an important point. For, if we are to encourage Black participation, we must do it on all levels, and not just at the ballot box after the selection process is over.
Delegate selection reform breaks but the tip of the iceberg in the needed changes within our party. We must encourage participation at all levels and one effective way to do this is through state central committees. The commission, as was the McGovern-Fraser Commission, is mandated to deal with State party structure, and the Democratic National Committee has a special Equal Rights Committee empowered to
6
investigate discrimination within the state parties. In this area, we have been extremely delinquent. State committees are important structures in the party, for only if they function can we be assured of continued activity between Presidential elections. And yet, state parties are allowed to exist in the most nominal way. While Blacks have shown a desire to participate in the party, there is but one Black State Chairman in the country. South Carolina has one Black member of its 46-member State Executive Committee, and only two Black state party officers, and Arkansas has no Blacks in its state-level apparatus.
While I have not other in-depth statistics on the actual number of Blacks on state central committees, I am quite sure we are under-represented.
Blacks have become an integral part of the Democratic Party and have chosen our party as presently the most effective national organism
7
in the political system. Since last year, in eleven Southern states, Black elected officials have increased by almost 300 to 1144 elected persons. Black people do vote: we are beginning now to recognize our strength and leadership. Yet, while we are generally doing this through the Democratic Party, we are continually pushed aside or excluded from the decision-making level. This inconsistency makes many loyal Black Democrats ask why we must always be the ones to compromise. We must encourage Black participation, not only at conventions, but at every level in the party structure. In order for us to have a full participation in the political system, we must be included at all levels of decision making.
Those hostile to full participation also ask that the reforms be revised to all state committees to select twenty percent of the national delegates — c-5 — I say we cannot allow this at a time when these committees are in themselves, biased and unrepresentative of the
8
Democrats in their states.
[Handwritten:] see draft  Some error
The Commission should check into the possibility of establishing uniform guidelines for all state committees. If the party is to become a majority party once again, and a coalition of young and old, rich and poor, then all levels of our expected constituency must have fair representation. Active state committees will increase the understanding
9
within our Party and so help ensure that all party roles and procedures are followed.
These hearings are not the place for an in-depth analysis of why people did not vote for the Democratic Presidential nominee in 1972. But I must take issue with those who would place the blame on the new rules. The reforms did not cause defeat. If there was a problem, it was due to a lack of understanding. I think we can say, in retrospect, that in 1972, those who wrote the rules knew them best and so could put them to work most effectively. But this will not be the case anymore, for everyone will have had a chance to read the book the second time around.
The McGoven-Fraser guidelines must be kept. While I have spent most of my time on a few specific areas, this should not imply a lack of concern about all the reforms.
The same rules are just as necessary to allow women, Chicanos,
10
blue collar workers and any other active group full and equal participation. I cannot understand why any group of Democrats wishing to re-unify the party could even remotely suggest any change in the rules which might once again close the system up tight. Unity and strength cannot and will not be achieved by stepping backwards, but only through deeper understanding and use of the rules.
The hearings being held throughout the country are a great step toward this goal and we must continue to try and reach all segments of the population.
Therefore, I strongly urge the Commission to keep Sections A-1, A-2, C-5 and all of the guidelines intact.

Like most other code words (like law and order) it's intentionally misleading and purposefully inflammatory. Guidelines A-1 and A-3, we are told, imposed quotas on the Democratic Party's delegate selection process. Those quotas, we are told, included special biological and racial categories for some, only by excluding others. The quotas, we are told, were so rigid that they produced an unrepresentative convention, so abhorrent that they drove many Democrats from the party in 1972.
Let's look at this year's bugaboo a little closer.
First, it is simply not true that the guidelines called for quotas.
They called for affirmative action and reasonable representation.
In examining the delegate selection process in effect in 1968 and prior years, the McGovern Fraser commission found both widespread discrimination and underrepresentation. In dealing with these problems,
2
the commission determined that it would not be enough simply to eliminate the barriers to participation.
For a time—not permanently—state parties were told they would have to take positive steps to overcome the effects of that discrimination. This is not a radical proposition. It is no different, I would remind you, than what even the Nixon administration required in the area of job discrimination—and no one has recently accused Richard Nixon of coddling Black people. And I would remind you that the Democratic Party commission that adopted these requirements was by no means a radical body. It included governors, senators, members of the U.S. House, state chairmen, members of the national committee and state legislators.
State parties were to adopt specific affirmative action programs to deal with these problems, and submit these programs to the Democratic National Committee.
3
By January 1, 1972, when states began selecting delegates, only three states all over the country had actually submitted these programs. It is no understatement to say that between 1968 and 1972 the rule of the McGovern Fraser commission that was heeded least was the call for affirmative action.
Secondly, the charge that the party imposed quotas is simply not true. More than a dozen states were seated with less than one-third women on their delegations. West Virginia's delegation had 6% women, 6% youth, and no Black members at all. What kind of a quota system is that? Moreover, even in the celebrated cases—the challenge to Mayor Daley's delegates—who included a handful of women, a handful of Blacks, and a handful of youth—the decision of the hearing officer hinged on the secret slatemaking meetings, not the imposition of an arbitrary quota.
4
I don't deny that the rules were misunderstood in many instances and completely misapplied in a few. But the lesson of 1972 must be to eliminate those misunderstandings, not to eliminate rules that were long overdue. Rules that brought the Democratic Party a large step closer to fulfilling the promises made in the conventions of 1948 and 1964, and 1968.
That is the task of this commission, not to surrender to the cry of ""quotas"".
The experience of 1972 has also given rise to the charge that the Democratic Party has been overzealous on behalf of minorities. That is another device of those who would roll back the progress that has been made.
But, like ""quotas"", it doesn't square with the facts. After 1968, the Democratic National Committee established a permanent equal rights committee. This body was to meet ""at least four times each year"" to
5
assure better representation of Blacks and browns at all levels of the party. But the equal rights committee did not meet four times over the entire four years.
Moreover, the mandates from the 1964 and 1968 conventions called for an elimination of discrimination at all levels of the party. But there has been no vigilance to these mandates. No national party commission has paid attention to Black representation in state party structures. And the results bear out this inattention. Consider the states included in this Southern regional hearing. In South Carolina, there is only one Black member of the 46-person state executive committee, and only two Black state party officers, with no voting power.
Louisiana has only three Blacks on its 120-member state committee. And the Democratic state committee of Arkansas has no Black representation whatever. Inattention, not overzealousness, is the problem. In some respects, we have had our own politics and policies of benign neglect.

In the South, in the city of Atlanta, it is almost unnecessary to remind a commission of the national Democratic Party that Blacks are the most loyal supporters this party has.
Nationwide, Lyndon Johnson received 97% of the Black vote in 1964 and Hubert Humphrey received 94% in 1968. This year, according to the joint center for political studies in Washington, George McGovern got 93% of all the votes cast by Blacks.
State level statistics in the South indicate how important Black voters are to the national ticket. In Alabama, Georgia, Louisiana, Mississippi and South Carolina, Blacks contributed more than seventy percent of the total vote that Vice President Humphrey received in 1968. In Mississippi, the rule of thumb for the past three elections has been that 90% of the Blacks support the ticket and 90% of the Democratic vote is Black.
Nor is this support exclusively for the national ticket. For
7
example, in 1968, Ernest Hollings won his South Carolina senatorial election by 12,000 votes. South Carolina whites gave 55% of their votes to his opponent, while Blacks voted 97% for Hollings, giving him a plurality of 65,000 Black votes. In 1970, John West, like Hollings, received a minority of the South Carolina white vote in his gubernatorial bid (40%). He got 98% of the Black vote, and he won.
But Blacks are not necessarily knee-jerk Democrats anymore, as candidates in Virginia and Arkansas are well aware. A University of Michigan survey taken last fall indicates that for the first time since we joined the Roosevelt coalition, Blacks have begun to loosen their tie to the Democratic Party. That poll showed a 16-point decline in the proportion of Blacks who identified with the party.
This is a trend that the Democratic Party would do well to watch. And this commission will have an absolutely crucial role to play in the future relationship between Blacks and the party.
8
1972 represented genuine progress. What the Civil Rights Acts and the Voting Rights Act did for the electoral process, the McGovern Fraser guidelines did for the nominating process. It is no exaggeration to say that last year was the first time that Black Americans played any significant role whatever in the nomination of a candidate for the presidency. To fall back from that progress is to gamble with the future loyalty of this party's most loyal supporters.

Like most other code words (like law and order) it's intentionally misleading and purposely inflamatory. Guidelines A-1 and A-2, we are told, imposed quotas on the Democratic Party's delegate selection process. Those quotas, we are told, included special biological and racial categories for some, only by excluding others. The quotas, we are told, were so rigid that they produced an unrepresentative convention, and so abhorrent that they drove many Democrats from the party in 1972.
Let's look at this year's bugaboo a little closer.
First, it is simply not true that the guidelines called for quotas. They called for affirmative action and reasonable representation.
In examining the delegate selection processes in effect in 1968 and prior years, the McGovern Fraser Commission found both widespread discrimination and underrepresentation. In dealing with these problemss,
2
the Commission determined that it would not be enough simply to eliminate the barriers to participation.
For a time - not permanently - state parties were told they would have to take positive steps to overcome the effects of that discrimination. This is not a radical proposition. It is no different, I would remind you, than what even the Nixon administration required in the area of job discrimination - and no one has recently accused Richard Nixon of coddling Black people. And I would remind you that the Democratic Party Commission that adopted these requirements was by no means a radical body. It included governors, senators, members of the U.S. House, state chairmen, members of the national committee and state legislators.
State parties were to adopt specific affirmative action programs to deal with these problems, and submit these programs to the Democratic National Committee.
3
By January 1, 1972, when states began selecting delegates, only three states all over the country had actually submitted these programs. It is no understatement to say that between 1968 and 1972 the rule of the McGovern Fraser Commission that was heeded least was the call for affirmative action.
Secondly, the charge that the party imposed quotas is simply not true. More than a dozen states were seated with less than one-third women on their delegations. West Virginia's delegation had 6% women, 6% youth, and no Black members at all. What kind of a quota system is that? Moreover, even in the celebrated cases - the challenge to Mayor Daley's delegates - who included a handful of women, a handful of Blacks, and a handful of youth - the decision of the hearing officer hinged on secret slatemaking meetings, not the imposition of an arbitrary quota.
4
I don't deny that the rules were misunderstood in many instances  and completely misapplied in a few. But the lesson of 1972 must be to eliminate those misunderstandings, not to eliminate rules that were long overdue. Rules that brought the Democratic Party a large step closer to fulfilling the promises made in the convention of 1948 and 1964, and 1968.
That is the task of this commission, not to surrender to the cry of ""quotas"".
The experience of 1972 has also given rise to the charge that the Democratic Party has been overzealous on behalf of minorities. That is another device of those who would roll back the progress that has been made.
But, like ""quotas"", it doesn't square with the facts. After 1968, the Democratic National Committee established a permanent equal rights committee. This body was to meet ""at least four times each year"" to 
5
assure better representation of Blacks and browns at all levels of the party. But the Equal Rights Committee did not meet four times over the entire four years.
Moreover, the mandates from the 1964 and 1968 conventions called for an elimination of discrimination at all levels of the party. But there has been no vigilance to these mandates. No national party commission has paid attention to Black representation in state party structures. And the results bear out this inattention. Consider the states included in this Southern regional hearing. In South Carolina, there is only one Black member of the 46-person State Executive Committee, and only two Black state party officers, with no voting power.
Louisiana has only three Blacks on its 120-member state committee. And the Democratic State Committee of Arkansas has no Black representation whatever. Inattention, not overzealousness, is the problem. In some respects, we have had our own politics and policies of benign neglect.

About three weeks ago, President Nixon unveiled his new housing program. It received almost unanimous support from the United States Savings and Loan League and other sections of the national financial community.
Coupled with that announcement came the speculation - or gossip - in Washington that the President would replace HUD Secretary Lynn with someone with more experience in housing than the Secretary's present background as successful blockbuster in Cleveland. The new appointee would be someone with real expertise in housing finance like Bebe Rebozo or Robert Ablanalp, whose massive high income housing complexes in San Clemente and Key Biscayne have made them world famous.
My own expertise in the housing field stems largely from my constituency: My legislative district is what is euphemistically called an ""Inner City"" district - its inhabitants are largely poor, overwhelmingly black, and almost uniformly ill housed.
I want to discuss housing in its political context and concentrate largely on governmentally assisted housing, the only kind that marginally serves the poor.
From its inception in 1937, the nature of governmentally assisted housing has been essentially a result of the will of the majority, translated into political power. The middle class, outnumbering the rich and the poor, have possessed the political sophistication to make its collective will felt. Governmental housing programs have been shaped largely by the needs and desires of that group.
Governmentally assisted housing became a reality in the United States only as a result of the Great Depression. There were some gingerly steps toward public housing after the first world war, and a few more in the States during the twenties, but a serious housing
2
program had to wait for the days of the Depression, when millions of members of the middle class, unemployed or underemployed, and therefore no longer able to house themselves comfortably, clamored for a federal program of subsidized housing.
In 1935, Senator Wagner of New York, introduced a bill in Congress to establish a permanent low-rent public housing administration within the federal bureaucracy. The bill, the Senator argued, would stimulate business activity, increase employment, and assist the local governments to eliminate slums and unsanitary tenements.
On September 1, 1937, President Roosevelt signed the United States Housing Act of 1937, which was to begin a ""new era in the economic and social life of America."" The resultant legislation served middle class interests rather than those of the rock-bottom poor, requiring, for example, that tenants pay moderate rents. Initially, then, governmental housing was intended to be the home of the ""submerged middle class.""
This initial middle class pressure has been demonstrated in most subsequent federal housing legislation, for the political popularity of such housing has risen and fallen according to the ways in which it served the purposes of the middle class. The second major piece of federal housing legislation, the Housing Act of 1949, was passed during the post World War II housing shortage, when the need for housing afflicted the entire population. In passing this Act, Congress made an explicit commitment to establishing as a national goal the realization of a ""decent home and suitable environment for every American family."" While low-rent public housing was given new life, an even greater impetus was given to FHA and VA insurance which would facilitate home ownership once the economy began its rapid upswing, for the ""submerged"" middle-class residing in public housing.
Soon after the war, as the economy climbed, two trends developed which diminished the popularity of low-rent government housing. First, the ""submerged middle class"" of the Depression, with newly acquired mobility and affluence, began to migrate from the cities to the suburbs.
3
Second, blacks began to move from the rural South to the cities. With these two developments, low-rent public housing shifted at an ever increasing rate, from housing for lower middle class whites to housing for impoverished blacks. And with this shift, political support for low-rent housing declined. On several occasions in the 1950's, the very life of the public housing program was saved by just a few votes. It was not until the urban ghetto riots of the 1960's that there developed a new, if not transient, sense of urgency and consciousness concerning the housing needs of the poor which led to a series of more innovative laws, such as sections 235 and 236, and more general support of housing for low and moderate income families. However, as our cities quieted down, the support for housing of the poor correspondingly diminished.
It is not difficult to identify the reasons for middle class indifference, and sometimes revulsion, to low-rent housing. From the time that public housing no longer housed the ""submerged middle class,"" self-centered reasons for supporting the programs dissipated. As public housing became increasingly the domain of blacks, it became a horror from which escape had to be devised. Whites feared that property values would fall, the neighborhood would become inundated by blacks and that the neighborhood's social status would decline.
Thus with the continued growth of suburban communities and their sense of insulation, security and exclusiveness, threats to their social and economic homogeneity have been vigorously resisted. The natural constituency of governmentally assisted housing - the poor - have been too weak and unsophisticated politically to assert their needs. The middle class, conversely, has manifested considerable political dexterity in its efforts to exclude such housing. Conscious political decisions at all levels of government have reinforced the exclusion of housing for the poor and black, and indeed, directed its location so as to perpetuate segregation.
4
Consider Atlanta: The ""most progressive city in the South"", a city ""too busy to hate"", or ""too young to die"". It was in Atlanta in 1936 that the nation's first federally assisted low rent housing was built. Six hundred and four (604) units -- an all-white project. While ranked 27th in population nationally, Atlanta now has the 5th largest low-rent public housing program in the nation with over 14,000 units housing over 49,000 people. My legislative district contains over 3,000 of the units -- over 1/4 of them. Forty-nine thousand people is larger than the population of Athens, Georgia; in fact, only six cities in Georgia and 18 of the state's 159 counties have populations in excess of Atlanta's public housing population. These impressive figures, however, take on meaning only when broken down into racial composition and geographical location. At the present time, over 80% of the tenants in Atlanta's public housing are black. By political design, and sometimes by chance, most of this housing has been concentrated within 8 of Atlanta's slums. Of the 14,000 units of low-rent public housing, 56% are located in areas which are 90% to 100% black, and another 20% in areas which are 70% to 90% black. The effect of this has been to limit the interest in public housing to blacks, who comprise 88% to 90% of the 30,000 people on the waiting list.
Two years ago the U.S. District Court in Atlanta, in the case of Crow V. Brown, found that the City of Atlanta, the two counties of which it is comprised, the Atlanta Housing Authority, and the U.S. Department of HUD, through the public housing program had contributed to and helped perpetuate racial segregation in Atlanta. One of the consequences of this racial concentration, the Court said, is that it has become virtually impossible to achieve meaningful school desegregation, and that the dispersal of urban housing patterns is the only alternative to massive bussing if desegregation, rather than re-segregation, is to be achieved. Another consequence of this racial concentration, the Court found, was a swelling of unemployment rolls in the city since job opportunities have become more scarce each year, while they have increased in the suburbs. The Court consequently ordered that the county and the housing authority form a joint committee to develop and implement a program of balanced and dispersed pubic housing, including the selection of specific sites that would
5
be appropriate. A noble decision: But the results were less so.
The joint committee, responding to the Court order, selected some 59 despersal sites on which low-density, low-rent public housing could be constructed. Yet, as of this date, no housing has been constructed or is even contemplated for any of the sites. While Nixon's public housing funds cut-off in January had some adverse effect, the Housing Authority did have several hundred units of housing reserved and funded which could have been used were the Nixon Administration and HUD and local governments really so disposed.
In a recent letter to the Court, the Director of the Housing Authority explained its failure to disperse low rent housing as a function of the roles of HUD and local governments. For one thing, the letter said, HUD guidelines indicate little or no commitment to dispersal. While racial dispersal requirements are clear - to the point of making new housing in racially impacted areas almost impossible - the guidelines ignore the costs involved in economic dispersal. Moving people from racially impacted areas means moving them to affluent areas with high land costs. Yet HUD refuses to extend its maximum for land costs per unit of housing to promote dispersal as mandated by the Court.
For another thing, the leased housing program is financed by HUD at rental levels so low that it is practically impossible for the Housing Authority to obtain such housing built recently in good middle class neighborhoods. Another difficulty citied is that HUD's regulations with respect to environmental impact require major research and voluminous reports. For example, the regulations' heavy emphasis on noise level standards ruled out some otherwise desirable sites, subsequently used by private housing developers. Thus while the Nixon administration has mouthed its fervent support for the dispersal of low-income housing, a political decision was made in Washington that enforcing this policy by making dispersal an economic reality would antagonize the predominately white middle class, the over-whelming majority of the national electorate, the silent majority.
6
The role of the local governmental entities in failing to meet the Court orders for dispersal, according to the Housing Authority Director's letter to the Court, could be summarized as a failure to establish clear housing goals and a total lack of commitment to the goal of dispersing public housing.
Ironically, this intentional pattern of political decision-making which has concentrated blacks in the inner-city and continues to perpetuate this concentration, has contributed in no small measure to the expected victory tomorrow of Atlanta's first black Mayor and black City Council majority.
Having briefly discussed how political decisions have influenced federal housing policy and determined the location of low-rent housing so as to perpetuate racial segregation, let us consider ways, if any, that the political decision-making process can be influenced and perhaps manipulated in the favor of the poor. And let's look again at the Georgia and Atlanta experiences.
The Nixon moratorium on federally assisted housing programs was declared in early January of this year, coinciding almost exactly with the opening of the 1973 Session of the Georgia General Assembly. For several months before the opening of the session, there had been informal but serious discussion among members of the House Committee on State Planning and Community Affairs, the House's most progressive committee, on anticipating Nixon's ""New Federalism"" -- the returning of tax dollars to the states in relatively unrestricted grants as manifest by general revenue sharing and his proposed special revenue sharing -- and creating a state housing finance agency which would take that money and effectively utilize and maximize it with its tax-exempt bond financing power.
The idea of state housing finance agencies was conceived of in New York over a decade ago, and has recently been imitated in 20 or so states. A public corporation is created by the legislature and authorized to issue tax exempt bonds, and to utilize the proceeds of the bonds to make low-interest rate loans -- at about 5 percent or approximately half of the conventional home purchase rate -- to private and non-profit developers for the construction of low- and moderate-
7
income housing. When utilized in conjunction with federal housing subsidies, the agencies have had great flexibility and success in promoting the development of housing for all income levels.
Conspicuously missing from the list of states that have housing finance agencies are those states in the deep South. And this is not because the South has no housing problems.
The South has:

31% of the nation's population
36% of all public housing units
40% of all of the nation's inadequate housing units
40% of the nation's poor;

all as a result of its long-standing economic and social entrenchment. But we felt that the moratorium on federally assisted housing might provide the impetus we needed to gather the rural Georgian legislators' political support. After all, the moratorium did spell significant adverse economic effects for Georgia. The slogan, ""stay alive with Section 235,"" was more than rhetoric to the small time rural Georgia builders and contractors -- it was, in fact, their livelihood. Even Georgia Senator Herman Talmadge -- who had never been a particularly vociferous spokesman on behalf of housing for the poor -- blasted Nixon for his callous action, having in mind, of course, its effect on his home builder constituents.
Taking the message from Talmadge, the Committee prepared a detailed report on the potential economic effects of an 18 month loss of federal subsidies in Georgia -- millions of dollars in housing construction that would be lost to the state and in terms of man working hours lost. Politically, the key to getting enactment was clearly through appealing to the pockets of the rural legislators. In fact, the mention of housing for low- and moderate-income families was consciously, but with great difficulty, omitted from all public dialogue. For just talking about state involvement in housing finance -- even for moderate income families -- evoked among Georgia's ""statesmen"" the image and stigma of public housing for blacks.
8
Once the bill was finally drafted, only a month remained in the 1973 Session -- hardly adequate time to rally political support for a major piece of complex legislation, particularly in view of the fact that over 1,000 pieces of legislation still had to be considered by the House and the Senate. The events that transpired, while mostly depressing, were also extremely edifying, and as a result of learning from that experience, there is a good likelihood that the bill will become law in 1974.
One of the time-consuming difficulties we confronted was dealing with the question of the bill's legality. The Governor, who was generally in support of the bill, refused to openly support it until convinced of its ability to withstand a Court test, although the almost identical legislation had been upheld in the Supreme Courts of some 18 other states.
The problem, it turned out, was that the Attorney General's office was hung up over whether or not financing housing was a ""public purpose"" for which state funds could be utilized. It seems that the Georgia Constitution enumerates as a public purpose, ""the housing of poultry and livestock,"" but not the housing of people. We were able to get around this surreal obstacle by inserting in the legislation the provision that the bill's purpose was to stimulate the economy of Georgia by promoting commerce and industry, an enumerated public purpose.
Later, a public hearing on the housing bill was held for special interest groups. The first speaker on the agenda was the President of Georgia's influential Home Builders Association, who proudly announced that, while he had not read the bill, he opposed it for five reasons.
The bill, of course, posed none of the threats he suggested, which included the threat of the State Housing Finance Agency putting small contractors out of business by a creeping communist take-over of all housing construction activity. Needless to say, the remarks of the President of the Home Builders Association cast serious, but
9
totally unfounded, questions in the minds of others who had come to testify in favor of the bill. The housing bill consequently did not develop enough momentum to even get out of committee. With the economic effects of the moratorium now being acutely felt, and with plenty of time now to mobilize support, the likelihood of passage during the upcoming session appears quite good.
This brief history of a dream deferred demonstrates rather clearly how political pressures and economic interest dominate the decision making about where all of us shall live, where we shall work, and how and where we will be educated.
These decisions are seldom made in a vacuum, but are made in the larger context of the city's - or the state's or the nation's - political view of what, if anything, is good for or needed by the society's underclass.
A recent study by the Joint Economic Committee of the United States Congress found that two thirds of all Federal housing subsidies are tax subsidies, subsidies to the middle and upper classes, a demonstration of the old truism that America's government believes strongly in socialism for the wealthy and capitalism for the poor.
That condition will prevail, unless and until the ill-housed can join forces with a larger segment of the general population to insure that housing for all becomes a reality.
That force has to make itself heard in Council and Legislative Chambers where the only voices now speaking out are those grown fat and sluggish on dollars from the Federal till, but who oppose any extension of governmental largesse to the poor.
Until that coalition of the unwanted can become a reality, nothing can be expected to change.

As this symposium topic suggests, the civil rights period includes the principal events covered by the years from 1960 to 1970. I am grateful to the symposium sponsors for the invitation to make this contribution to the discussion.
It is easy, after even a casual review of the events of this decade, to conclude that this period is one of those constituting a great leap forward for our nation in this civil rights field.
It was a time of significant history. It was a time of excitement. It was a time of satisfying achievement. It was a time of sadness, a period marked by assassination, used as a weapon to try to halt social progress.
Who now living can forget the striking down, in 1963, of a young and vital President of the United States? Or the healing words and acts of his strong successor, striving to keep the nation on an even keel during the turbulent years?
The time was one of significant history. it was best said, perhaps by President Lyndon B. Johnson in his memorable speech in the Spring of 1965:
""In our time we have come to live with moments of great crisis. Our lives have been marked with debate about great issues;
Wilkins - 2
issues of war and peace, of prosperity and depression. But rarely in any time does an issue lay bare the secret heart of America itself. Rarely are we met with a challenge, not to our growth or abundance, our welfare or security, but rather to the values and the purposes and the meaning of our beloved nation.
""The issue of equal rights for American Negroes is such an issue. And should we defeat every enemy, should we double our wealth and conquer the stars, and still be unequal to this issue, then we will have failed as a people and as a nation.""
For this perceptive leadership, although we are still at work on the business of achieving equality, every American who understands and loves his country gives thanks.
The new phase of the old struggle began February 1, 1960, when four young Negroes sat down in a lunchroom in Greensboro, N. C., and asked to be served. One of the four in this Greensboro sit-in that was to sweep the nation, I am proud to recount, was a member of the NAACP chapter at A. and T. College in Greensboro. Later he told his story in these brief words:
""I had served in the U. S. Air Force and had seen men eat together, study together and fight together, regardless of their race or color. But when I came home to my state, I could not order a piece of pie or a hamburger and a cup of coffee at the poorest of lunchrooms. For me, training as a physician could wait until this question of simple human dignity was resolved.""
Apparently there were thousands of black youngsters and many older ones who felt the same way. They had just been awaiting a signal. News came one day of the arrest of several hundred young
Wilkins - 3
people in a certain state and hard on the heels of that intelligence the information that one elderly Negro had appeared with $4,000 in cash to furnish bail for the young people.
The sit-ins and the later Freedom Rides occurred in every part of the nation. They rose to their peak in 1963 when, in Birmingham, Ala., under the personal inspiration of the late Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., an encounter which employed fire hose and police dogs brought an aroused public to the realization that a determined and inspired people could not be halted by repression. It was, indeed, a time of excitement.
The next month, June, 1963, the brutal assassination of Medgar Evers, state director of NAACP work in Mississippi, was to add to the excitement -- and sadness -- of the decade. As he stepped from his car one midnight and was about to enter his home, Evers was killed by a rifleman hiding in the bushes across the street.
On June 1, Evers had been arrested and released on $1,000 bond for picketing downtown stores for their lily-white hiring policies. Twelve days later he was slain.
It was a decade of satisfying achievement in which black Americans helped their country toward its declared purpose, its destiny. President John F. Kennedy had remained convinced that civil rights legislation was not necessary. The dogs and fire hoses in Birmingham helped to persuade him that he might not be following a course in the best interest of America.
The assassination of Medgar Evers on June 12 convinced him. On June 19 JFK announced in a brief and moving television speech
Wilkins - 4
that he was sending an omnibus civil rights bill to the Congress.
It was that bill, at least these portions that survived Congressional committee treatment, which became that Civil Rights Act of 1964. It was called for by President Johnson in his first speech to the join houses of Congress after the state funeral of President Kennedy.
Between the sending of a civil rights message to the Congress in June and his assassination in November, two events in this momentous decade had an effect on the civil rights movement.
The nation reacted with shock and horror in September, 1963, when a bomb exploded in a Birmingham church and killed four little Negro girls. Evidently the explosion was a booby-trap type that caught the girls on their way, in the building, to Sunday School. No one can estimate the anger of millions of black citizens and the millions of sympathetic whites. The overwhelming sentiment was that the government must act to halt this racial terror.
The event which added to the pride in our country, in a sense of achievement under the system of American democracy, was the March on Washington of August 28, 1963. Some 220,000, about 40,000 of them white, journeyed to Washington for one day of petitioning and then went quietly and soberly--and proud--back to their homes.
They marched down Constitution avenue to the Lincoln monument. There, in a crowd that stretched down the Mall, they heard ten short speeches by the leaders of the ten cooperating organizations. and they heard Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., give his famous speech, heard 'round the world, ""I Have a Dream.""
No one who was there or who watched the history-making event
Wilkins - 5
on television or heard the stirring words over the radio will ever forget the experience. Order there was. And good humor. And love. More than a hundred members of both Houses of Congress were present. There was a great satisfaction in completely disproving the warnings of chiefs of sections and of the proprietors of many stores that the blacks would ""tear up the town."" Women employes were told to stay off the streets and to keep their doors locked!
No gathering of comparable size has been organized in so short a time. The meeting where the March idea was born was held July 2, 1963. That it was a success eight weeks later is a tribute to Bayard Rustin, coordinator and general planner, to A. Philip Randolph who dreamed the dream, and to their mostly volunteer staffs. No grants of funds or foundation money were used. The organizations bore the expenses.
President Kennedy, who had given the enterprise his blessing, was in a good mood as he greeted the ten leaders at the White house afterwards. He said he knew that the proper follow-up would be made. The impact of the March on the unsettled civil rights situation and on the Congress was unprecedented. More than 200,000 Americans had petitioned their government in person for civil rights legislation and for jobs.
As President Johnson was to say almost two years later, ""the secret heart of America"" had been laid bare.
It was in 1964 that the civil rights bill became law with the exception of Title 6, the fair employment section, which became law a year later.
The decade was marked by violent assassinations, some of
Wilkins - 6
which have been referred to here. Medgar Evers was one. The whole world was plunged into shock and mourning when an assassin’s bullets took the life of our beloved President, John F. Kennedy. Then came Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., in April, 1968, and with deadly swiftness, Senator Robert F. Kennedy in June, 1968.
All were efforts to halt change. Perhaps the killing of King is the clearest of the three, although the Kennedy brothers were certainly harbingers of a new order. But King was definitely identifiable as a leader in the decade’s upsurge in civil rights. His death just might halt the onrush. It would certainly stir the black populace to emotional and violent, even destructive, action.
It would upset the country, perhaps call down repressive action by a nation which felt itself threatened. If this developed and the control were successful, though bloody, the increase in sullen, resentful and frustrated black revolutionaries would be a dividend for the forces of racial suspicion and division.
As we look back on the trying days following the King assassination, resentment was created in some segments of the black community, but the crop of black revolutionaries amounted to but a handful.
In the between years, in January, 1966, occurred the firebombing of the home of Vernon Dahmer, in Hattiesburg, Miss. Dahmer, a prosperous business man, committed the “crime” of allowing his grocery store to be used a s a depository by those of his people who desired to register to vote. He lost his life, his store and his home to the mob. What the commanding officers told his sons when they were sent from their regiments to attend their father’s
Wilkins - 7
funeral is not recorded.
To thoughtful students of the decade the most significant action was the announcement and the carrying through to enactment of the Voting Rights Act of 1965. The effort, spearheaded by President Johnson, was, of course, a redress of the wrongs of many decades. More importantly, however, it was the placing of a tool in the hands of the black population with which it could fashion its own protection and chart its own progress in a democratic society.
Lyndon Johnson had had the vote in mind for many years. He had startled the country by voting for the civil rights bill of 1957 which emphasized the ballot. It did not seem to the Majority Leader of the U. S. Senate that anyone in good conscience could object to the extension of the right to vote to every citizen.
Undoubtedly he watched the upheavals of the Sixties in his belief that political influence, based upon the vote, could substitute constructively for many of the conflicts. So he bided his time and once the Kennedy-sponsored Civil Rights Act was enacted in 1964, he set out to achieve his own legislative objective, which became the Voting Rights Act of 1965.
In preparation for the bill he included the Negro population as well as the white majority. It has become the fashion in shaping a majority, to ignore the 22 millions of blacks. In October a radio speaker handled this situation by saying: ""And the basics are the same in every part of the country. They are the same for the Polish-American, the Italian-American, the Mexican-American,
Wilkins - 8
the steelworker, the farmer.” No mention here of the Negro American.
This, of course, was not the case in 1965. Black Americans were in the Congressional audience. They were in the gallery which listened to the speech.
And the white majority in the nation had demonstrated to it the importance attached to the proceedings by the Chief Executive. The address was on prime television time in the evening. It was to a joint session of both the House and the Senate. It included members of the U. S. Supreme Court and members of the Cabinet. The leaders of the nation had been assembled. The American people, final arbiters in any proposal, were there to hear about the denial of the right to vote and the bill proposed as a remedy.
Wherever they are, Negro citizens of America owe their increased participation in American life to the Voting Rights Act of 1965. There are now about 2,000 elected black officeholders. They are in all sorts of positions, with all kinds of responsibilities. They make mistakes, just as do other elected officials. But they also perform services, some as well as others. A few render exceptional services.
Every Southern state has at least one black member of the State legislature. Georgia has about fifteen. A gain of 21 seats among all the states was registered in the last election. Three new members of Congress, Yvonne Burke from Los Angeles, Barbara Jordan of Texas and the Rev. Andres Young of Atlanta were elected in November, swelling the black total to fifteen in the House. Senator Edward Brooke is a Republican from Massachusetts. There
Wilkins - 9
are in addition, many blacks who have been appointed to office.
The stepped-up registration of voters accounts for much of this increase, particularly in areas where there had been, before 1966, little effort to register blacks. In fact, there had been active efforts to disenfranchise blacks. In the words of President Johnson, in his message of March 15, 1965: ""Every device of which human ingenuity is capable has been used to deny this right.""
For the Sixties the conception and enactment of the voting rights act was a high point. Despite its competition from grievous assassinations, violent encounters with the police and spectacular repression of the Negro population, the voting measure may prove to have been the most significant accomplishment of the decade in the area of civil rights.

Thank you. Thank you. Thank you a great, great deal.  
You know it's usually the custom for most speakers to tell the audience what a great pleasure it is to be wherever you find yourself happening to be. But it is a great pleasure for me to find myself here, and to find myself associated, if only in passing, with some of the people who have been here on yesterday and today. And it is particularly interesting to me to have an opportunity to meet Justice Warren. Dr. Sikes mentioned in the introduction that I had been involved in litigation before the Supreme Court. It's also interesting to look out into the audience and see the last real Attorney General the United States had, Mr. Ramsey Clark. In a very sense for me, Justice Warren, Attorney General Clark, and Attorney General Clark’s father represent in a very personal way the difference between the era we discuss, some of us with nostalgia, and the era we find ourselves in now.  
About two months ago in Kansas City, I appeared on the same platform with former Justice Clark and mentioned to him that I’d been involved in a Supreme Court case, it was titled Julian Bond versus Sloppy Floyd and the issue was whether or not the Georgia House of Representatives had the right to prevent me from taking my seat, and the court, under Justice Warren, decided unanimously in my favor, that I was right and they were wrong. And I asked Justice Clark if the same case were to come before the court now if it would be decided in the same fashion. And he just laughed. And I asked him again what would happen if the court case came before the court, and he just laughed again and I was told later that justices off the bench don’t comment on those on the bench. But I thought his laughter was sinister. And it frightened me. 
But in wondering why I was asked to join the distinguished people who have spoken here, I decided that it must have been because I am a politician. And I’ve been asked to speak on the politics of inequality. I want to emphasize that I am a politician not a statesman. Statesman is a politician who cannot get elected. And I am a politician. In political campaigns, I support candidate A or candidate B. In the last election between the two men running, I supported the man who lost. Now trying to get on the good side of the man who won, I probably shouldn’t even be here. But I hope he doesn’t take unkindly the bad things I, and some of us said about him over the course of the campaign. I want to be friends with him, I’m trying to learn how to tap dance.  
[The typed speech begins here.] 
We gather in Texas these two days to observe the opening of the repository of the documents of an era of the recent American past.
The record is more than the pieces of paper, copies of bills or speeches made.
The record is in changes in peoples' lives, in votes cast and elections won, in jobs secured, in educations achieved and in the bittersweet discovery that hamburgers are only hamburgers, wherever they are eaten.
Had that era not occurred, life for one-tenth of the nation would be poorer, poorer not in dollars and cents but in aspirations ended and hopes dashed, poorer in spirit.
That era ended four years ago. If, four years from now, similar gatherings are called to reflect on comparable achievements in the present government, the papers on civil rights would barely fill a
2
good match book and the meeting could be held in a telephone booth.
That is the result of our lost years, and will probably be the result of four years more.
Governments change, as do the men who run them. The changes of the Sixties the papers here reflect, as this collection is opened, are daily being closed out by men whose civil rights concerns are limited to the right to say ""busing"" or ""quotas"" or ""welfare"" instead of ""Nigger.""
That was the substance of the election just held.
Now that the nation's voters - at least, 54% of those eligible - have gone to the polls and expressed their choice, we have an opportunity to reflect on why that choice was made, what it meant, and what it will mean in the years ahead.
The choice, simply put, was between the past performance of one fallible man, and the unproved promises of another.
Those who believed Gallup and Harris knew that outcome was
3
never in doubt. We learned that the regular Democrats would split over McGovern; that organized labor didn't like him; that white Southern voters, with George Wallace gone, would go to Nixon; that the wealthy, worried about taxes, would do the same; that the middle class saw safer streets under Nixon; that the newly discovered white ""ethnics"" wanted to crack down on dissenters and deserters and that college students could not stick to anything over a prolonged period of time and that almost no single identifiable group could be found - except for Black people - to cast votes as a bloc for George McGovern.
The old Democratic coalition much mourned in recent years had vanished - in presidential politics, at any rate.
If the election on November 7th illuminated any political movement at all, it was the movement of the comfortable, the callous and the smug closing their ranks - and closing their hearts - against the claims and calls to conscience put forward by the forgotten and unrepresented
4
elements in American society.
Despite the talk about Eagleton, Watergate, the war, welfare, quotas, busing, taxes, McGovern's shifts on policy and platform, the last-minute Kissinger peace initiative, the central issue was clear.
As the Reverend Jesse Louis Jackson has put it, ""It's not the bus - it's us!""
There is something wrong with an election that sees one candidate receiving nearly all of the Black votes cast, and the other candidate receiving more than three-quarters of the white votes cast.
This does not describe a race between Democrats and Republicans, or even between two men named Nixon and McGovern; this was rather a national referendum on what has politely been called ""the social issue.""
For Black people in America, the election results on November 7th signaled consigning nearly all our political hopes and dreams to an immediate oblivion from which they may never emerge. It meant
5
reinstalling in power those who believe in privilege for the powerful and neglect of the powerless. It meant giving a four-year free hand to the current occupants of Uncle Strom's cabin, a free hand to men who have demonstrated they have no concern whatsoever for freedom of the press, for the privacy of the individual, or for the constitutionally guaranteed civil rights and liberties we should like to believe are taken for granted by those who govern us.
Mr. Nixon now has his four more years to put his men on the Supreme Court, to turn it back into the liberal social force it used to be or to continue its current trend toward repression.
He will continue to set the budget and name the directors of the Department of Health, Education and Welfare, the Department of Housing and Urban Development, the Department of Justice and the Federal Bureau of Intimidation.
He will continue to decide whether stocks go up or down, whether
6
money is loose or tight, whether our weekly paychecks buy more or less, or whether they buy anything at all.
He has got now, in fact, four years in which to shape America to his mold, to recruit from the frightened a constituency against the forgotten.
A short while ago, the National Urban Coalition tried to spell out what was wrong in this country, and how it could be set right.
""America's malaise,"" they said, ""--which all of us feel in one way or another--has its roots in the distance between national ideal and national reality.""
""Our ideal is a country where every American gets an equal chance to perform, where jobs exist for everyone who wants one, where health care and personal safety are assured, where we live in harmony with each other and have a decent place to live.""
""Our reality needs no full recital here. We know that most American cities are in trouble, that poverty continues in the midst of wealth,
7
that unemployment is high, that malnutrition is widespread, that injustice exists, that tensions endure. In sum, we know that our society is not functioning the way it is supposed to.""
""But if we solve the greatest of our ills,"" the Coalition said, ""our paralysis of spirit and will, we can narrow the distance between what we have and what we want. Indeed, we MUST marshal our good sense and our good will. There is no sensible alternative.""
In the Coalition view, ""America must pursue several major goals between now and the future."" We must try to:
""Achieve full employment with a high level of economic growth - all of our other policy goals depend upon it.
""Provide all citizens with an equal opportunity to participate in American society and in the shaping of governmental decisions affecting their lives.
""Guarantee that no American will go without the basic necessities: food, shelter, health care, a healthy environment, person safety,
8
and an adequate income.
""Meet our obligations to assist in the economic development of the world's lesser developed nations.
These are the goals. We can move a long way toward them by 1976."" 1
But in addition to the Coalition's major goals, and their definition of ""paralysis of will"" as the greatest of our ills, there is another goal much more desirable, another ill much more horrible. That ill is racism; the goal its containment and eradication.
Everyone knows, or ought to know, that there is one consuming problem that makes life in New York's Harlem, Cleveland's Hough, Los Angeles' Watts, or Atlanta's Vine City or any of America's other urban or rural Atticas - where some men are held in bondage by some other men - both intolerable and insufferable.
That problem is race. It is race that elected our present president in 1968; race that makes some Americans serve and die more readily than others in Vietnam; race that makes some children more educated than
9
others; race that colors all of our lives.
For the past several years, solutions to the problems of race, and therefore to the pathologies of society that spring from it, have been more than abundant.
There are several solutions that, if implemented, would begin to make this country a proper place for men and women to live and work and a healthy place for our children to play and grow and learn.
The nation could adopt, and strive for, a policy of full employment.
Equal opportunity, both racially and sexually, can stop being the rhetoric of campaigns and platforms and become the reality of the present.
Through public service employment, increased economic growth, increases in wage minimums and in guaranteeing social insurance by radically altering public assistance, every American can be guaranteed an income.
The institution of a national health insurance program and a radical alteration of federal housing programs will additionally aid in making
10
both urban and rural America more attractive places to live.
Of course, none of the above is likely to happen. Our Congress - overwhelmingly Democratic - is atrophied, cautious and frightened of the President. The much heralded ""New South"" seems depressingly like too much of the old. And for four more years we will have leadership in the White House that believes that the American people are children, after all, who must be bullied and protected by the great white godfather.
Black Americans traditionally looked to the Congress, the courts, and for a few short years - to the White House for our political salvation.
For nearly half the country on election day, the possibility of an exchange of presidents meant nothing more than an exchange of photographs on the post office wall, or on a dormitory wall dart board. For Black people, the election was a national referendum on us, on whether we would progress, run in place, or continue sliding backward as we have been doing since 1968.
Since Richard Nixon took office in 1968, we have spent billions more
11
on war; over two million more Americans have been added to the ranks of the unemployed; six million more are on ever mounting relief rolls, inflation has reduced our standard of living, and elitist, sexist and racist practices run rampant, unchecked through public and private American life.
These practices will not be ended by some cataclysmic revolution anytime soon. They can be dented, however, by hard work and by concerted political and social actions, if that action can gather together the best of what is left of the old coalition.
That has been the history of Black people's lives and politics in America: constant pressure and agitation, with or without allies, aimed at improving our position.
What has happened in the United States since the first Black people set foot here the year before the Mayflower arrived is that everything has changed and nothing has changed.
12
For one, we are no longer slaves. Secondly, we can sit at lunch counters, sit downstairs at movie theaters, ride in the front of buses, register, vote, work, and go to school where we once could not.
But in a great many ways, we are constantly discovering that things have either not changed at all, or have become much worse.
A quick look at all of the facts and figures that measure how well, or how poorly, a people are doing - the kinds of statistics that measure infant mortality, unemployment, median family income, life expectancy - demonstrates clearly that the average Black American, while better off in comparison than his father was, is actually worse off when his statistics are measured against similar ones for white people.
It is as though Black Americans are climbing a molasses mountain in snowshoes, while the rest of the country rides a rather leisurely ski lift to the top.
It is these depressing figures, and the accompanying pathology which
13
results from them, that causes so much discontent and depression in Black communities today.
The realization is that separately over the years the diverse strategies of Booker T. Washington and Dr. W. E. B. DuBois and Marcus Garvey and Martin Luther King and Malcolm X have not appreciably improved the material lot of the masses of Black people.
The separate agitations these philosophies gave birth to - either a return to Mother Africa, a struggle in the courts, a nonviolent thrust into the streets, a violent attempt at doing real injury to white America - all these have accustomed many white people to believe that Black people have by now got everything we want, and half of what white folks have, too.
But the problem so often referred to as America's Black problem - in reality a massive white problem - continues. It continues despite wars on poverty and great societies and new frontiers and will continue despite the new federalism.
14
The roots of the problem are deep in the fabric of this country and began with the rape of Africa, the stealing of child from mother, the separation of husband from wife, the imposition of an alien religion on an already religious group of people, the displacement of a whole people from their land and their country.
They involve the basest of prejudices, an economic system that has always believed property was more important than people; the results have been to place and keep Black people at the bottom of the ladder that in this nation is supposed to lead to jobs and homes and education and security.
It has made us the last to be hired and the first to be fired; it has recently, as any reading of the decade's Vietnam casualty lists will show, made our young men first in war, last in peace, and seldom in the hearts of our countrymen. It has given Black children an opportunity to attend school for twelve years while receiving six years of education.
15
It has placed us on relief, where we are called lazy and shiftless, while 6,000 white American farmers are paid $25,000 each a year not to farm.
In short, we are in bad shape. The gains made yesterday are vanishing today. The victories won in the wars of 1954 and 1960 are being negated by the winner of the battle of '68 and the rout of '72.
The question remains for the future: Will it continue to happen?
What is happening now happened once before in American history in the years after Reconstruction. In both cases, a president made a cynical deal, not just with the unreconstructed South, but with the national unreconstructed mentality that believed then as it believes now, that the American social agenda should not include those as the bottom of the ladder.
In return for political support, the national government in Washington agreed to let the individual states handle their ""social issue"" in its own way.
16
The promises made then that Black people would be included in the social and economic life of the nation were repudiated. Instead of fulfilling the dream, then as now:
- The liberal crusaders for social justice and democracy became weary and involved in other concerns;
- The aspirations of the movement by Blacks began to be curtailed, not by organized violence and barbarity, but by a series of legal and extra-legal maneuvers designed to make us less than political and economic equals;
- The hopes and belief of Black people that racial equality and social justice could be achieved through litigation, legislation, negotiation, occasional direct action and strong alliances with liberal and centrist groups were supplanted by disillusionment, bitterness, and open anger;
- The guilt an indignation of Northern supporters of the Southern drive for equality turned into an attitude of first cautious - and now
17
more open - racism when the northern Black man began to take seriously the claims of progress and began to look for visible signs in Northern cities. 2
Current American politics has made this process legitimate. The politics of wealth and stealth have replaced the politics of compassion and openness.
Reversing this recession of political concern ought to be part of the American agenda for the remainder of the seventies.
For Black Americans in the future, this will be done increasingly through political action.
Politics, as it has existed for us, is changing. Its history is a sorry one, a history with only one bright moment, the ten years of Reconstruction, the only ten American years when democracy began to mean as much in Mississippi as it did in Maine, the only American decade in which an aggressive national government acted with armed might to protect
18
the economic, civil and political rights of the Black population.
From the closing of that period of hope just before the beginning of the twentieth century -- the century whose problem, Dr. W. E. B. DuBois said, would be ""the problem of the color line"" - - to this point just past the middle of the twentieth, Black Americans have seen our fortunes ebb and rise and now, ebb again.
From the days when Frederick Douglass said ""The Republican Party is the ship; all else is the sea"" to the days of Franklin Delano Roosevelt, Black people have tried first one, and now the other, national political party.
We have been ill served by politicians whom the late Ralph McGill once called ""so grotesque it seems impossible they could have been influential.""
If the Reconstruction comparison is correct, then history repeats itself anew.
Just as that first Reconstruction ended with a deal made in a hotel
19
room, this second 1960's one ended that way, too: A deal made in a hotel in Miami Beach in 1968 that gave yesterday's America veto power over Supreme Court nominees; gave the white South hope that the drive to register Black voters would stop; gave the white South hope that the slow pace of school integration would move even slower; and breathed new life into the national mood of resistance to progress for Black people.
Those interested in beginning anew must re-assess the mistaken assumptions under which an earlier generation marched and picketed to limited and often plastic victories.
We must assume that most of America lacks the will, courage and intelligence to voluntarily grant Black Americans equality, and that they must be forced do to it by pressure or economic coercion.
We must also make other assumptions:
1. That people do not discriminate for the fun of it, but that the function of prejudice is to defend special interests (social, economic, political, psychological, and sexual) and that appeals to fair play by
20
prejudiced people are like prayers said to the wind.
2. That old patterns will change, and those in power will relinquish power only if they are forced to make a clear-cut choice between continuance of the old relationship and another clear-cut and highly cherished value: economic gain or civil peace or political stability and majority-based power.
3. That conflict and struggle and confrontation are often necessary for social change, and
4. That the rights and lives of real human beings are at stake, and these are in the long run neither ballotable nor negotiable.
Black people's politics, above all else, must be unified, organized and democratic, with a small ""d"".
The debate over who will broker power for the masses is a legitimate one, but no group can broker with presidents if it doesn't control a precinct back home.
In numbers of Blacks holding office we are at a zenith of power -
21
but in our ability to swing votes and reward service and punish opposition, and elect anyone beside ourselves, we are woefully inadequate.
The answer, of course, is organization and coalition, with the former first, for the latter asks the question, ""With whom?""
The November 7th election answered no one, at least for now.
For white Americans, the question becomes whether they can give up the many benefits - economic profit, political, power, social status, and psychological rewards - that are derived from the maintenance of the status quo.
Today's politics, then, is the ""I've got mine"" variety.
The public servant now makes the public slave to its own worst instincts.
American voters are registering more, but voting less.
The entire process is suspect, particularly so among those who expected the most and received the least.
We hear a great deal of talk - just after and just before American
22
elections - about real majorities, and new majorities and silent and noisy ones, and about which candidate failed to seize the center and which one was extreme.
Past election history demonstrates that the people will care about each other when they are taught to do so, not lectured, but taught. A good school teacher knows the difference, and good politicians and good people, led by good leadership can make a difference between the politics of despair and hopelessness and the politics of hope.
We had our fingers on it, not so long ago, and it slipped away. It slipped when busing stopped being transportation, and became integration; when welfare became a badge of laziness instead of a sign of helplessness; when reckless power delivered plums to the privileged and destroyed the programs aimed at the poor; and when there could not be summoned an American majority to cast votes for the future and against the past.
No, the try will be made again, in other days to come. Between now and then, the building process must continue to try to put together
23
those disaffected millions whose political concerns place them properly with the present, not the past.
All of the American politics for the future could take as its credo a statement written years ago by Dr. W. E. B. DuBois, who said:
""I believe in liberty for all men: the space to stretch their arms and their souls, the right to breath and the right to vote: the freedom to choose their friends, and enjoy the sunshine and ride on the railroads, uncursed by color: thinking, dreaming, working as they will in a kingdom of God and love. Finally, I believe in patience: patience with the weakness of the weak and the strength of the strong, the prejudice of the ignorant and the ignorance of the blind, patience with the tardy triumph of joy and the chastening of sorrow: patience with God.""

On Monday, I qualified to become a candidate for one of the 4 Democratic delegate seats from Georgia's 5th Congressional District. My brother James is a candidate for one of the three alternate seats. We both invite your support. We are both going to be on the ballot at the March 11 convention here as ""uncommitted"" delegates, believing that the interests of Black Georgians are best represented by delegates pledged to issues, and not to personalities.
These March 11th conventions across the state are of course the direct result of the 1968 challenge delegation from Georgia at the 1968 Democratic Delegation. Those activities four years ago forced recalcitrant states like Georgia to abolish their elitist methods of selecting national convention delegates, and forced them to adopt selection processes which include a maximum of grass roots participation.

The presidential elections in 1972 are of particular improtance to Black Americans. At issue will be our future relationship with the government of the United States.
On the ballot in Georgia in November of this year are likely to be the names of three anglo-saxon men in their 50s.
Two of the names are presumably already known. They are the incumbent president, Richard Nixon, and the hillbilly hitler from Alabama, George Wallace. The third name is important to us. Unlike voters in New York or California and a few other states, there is not likely to be a fourth slternative on our ballot in November. Our November choice is between Wallace Nixon, and someone else.
The someone else will not be someone who will eradicate all poverty, end all wars, erase all discrimination, eliminate all injustice.
Presidents in the United States never do those things. He will - and I emphasize ""he"" - choose new members of the Supreme Court who will decide whether 600 men on death row will die, whether the Georgia legislature' redistricting plan is valid, whether public school integration will continue at snail's pace, halt completely, or proceed without the current firings of black teachers and closings of black schools.
3
He will help set the budget for and policies of the Departments of Health, Education and Welfare and Housing and Urban Development.
He will - more than anyone else - determine whether the war against the innocent and righteous people of Vietnam halts completely, whether more of our sons and fathers dies there, whether we embark on other mindless adventures like thisone.
He will name commissioners of the Federal Communications Commission who can help decide whether Black Atlanta can see the educational program ""Black Journal"" on the only tv station in the country owned by a board of education with a black president. He will influence the course of legislation which will determine whether the proposed West Side Highway ravages my neighborhood, whether public housing continues to be shunted into one section of every big city. He will help decide whether welfare reform will be family destruction.
In other words, he will be important in each of our lives.
The decision about who this third, namesless someone will be will be made this summer in Miami.
Who ever he turns out to be, he has got to be better than the man we have there now.
4
Particularly important for us is to teach a hard lesson to the party that 90% of us voted for in 1964 and 1968, the party whose support in the last presidential election was 20% black.
We have got to find some way to avoid continuing to be the illegitimate child at the family reunion, always having to wait in the kitchen while the other family members - organized labor, the few remaining big city bosses, the more respectable elements of the dixiecrat South - eat up all of the gravy.
We therefore find ourselves between two compelling dillemnas - wanting on the one hand the permanent elimination of Richard Nixon from public office, and on the other hand, not to be taken for granted by any political party again.
5
But other political events - immediately outweighing Presidential races - are in the news today.
The most pressing of these is the struggle in the Georgia General Assembly over whether, and in what fashion, and by whom Atlanta's city limits will be extended.
6
As to the question of whether, the issue really seems to be not ""whether"", but when.
If any consensus at all exists among the members of the Fulton County House and Senate Delegations to the General Assembly, it is that 1972 or 1973 are the years in which this question will be dealt with.
The Black legislators from Atlanta have decided that if ""something"" will be done, then we must have ""something"" to say about what that ""something"" will be.
Several things are immediately unnaceptable. Most reprehensible is the prospect that additional territory will be added to the city, a new city government structure formed, without the benefit of any advise and counsel from the Black community, and that we will be still further excluded from participation in the government of the municipality in which we live.
It is precisely this last danger that we have moved to prevent.
The annexation proposal unveiled by the city's Black legislators earlier this week is not a carbon copy of the plan introduced earlier by Mayor Massell nor does it parallel any other plan introduced or mentioned by any other official.
Our proposal differs from the Mayors plan in the following improtant ways The Black legislators proposed that all - not just a small portion - of the Industrial District become a part of Atlanta. This addition of roughly 70 million dollars to the city's tax base should result in a decrease in taxes for present resident of the city. A house committee on yesterday adopted the plan with slight changes
Secondly, and more important to the political futures of Black Atlantans than any financial considerations, the Black legislators couple the annexation
7
of the Sandy Srpings - North Fulton area with a plan for rearranging Atlanta's wards, for changing the method of selection and number of Atlanta's aldermen, for insuring Black Atlanta has a chance at the Mayor's chair in 1973, and for insuring political parity and adequate representation on the Board of Aldermen from now into the conceivable future.
For example, the legislation undder discussion has an effective date of December 31, 1973. This means that on January 1st, 1974, all of the Fulton Industrial District and all of the annexed area to the North become tax-paying parts of the city limits of Atlanta.
It means additionally that only those people who live in Atlanta today - right now - will participate in the 1973 elections for Board of Education, the Board of Aldermen, Vice-Mayor and Mayor.
It means finally that residents of the annex d area to the North will be given an early opportunity in 1974 to select, by themselves, their representatives to the Atlanta Board of Education and the Board of Aldermen.
Our legislation makes the schools in the annexed portion part of the Atlanta School System, thus relieving hard-pressed Fulton County from the tremendous burden of educating about one-third of its present children, and lessening the fear that Fulton County will be hard pressed financially without
8
the Industrial District.
An additional ward is added to the city's present nine wards by our proposal. The tenth ward is the annexed portion to the North. The existing nine city wards are re-drawn under our legislation, de-drawn on a plan developed by a committee of the Board of Aldermen under Alderman Marvin Arrimgton.
Beginning with the election of aldermen and mayor on the first Tuesday after the first Monday in October, 1977, one alderman shall be elected from each of the ten wards by a majority vote of the voters of each particular ward; ten aldermen will be elected city-wide.
This plan is not perfect. Perfect legislation - like perfect lives - seldom comes from the minds of men.
The dilution of the Black population - but the increasing of black political potential - is the general result.
A more effective and responsive city government, a financially healthier city will be the result as well.
In developing this plan, we tried to touch base with the city's Black aldermen, the Vice-Mayor, community and civic leaders.
Very few of them - and very few of us, I might add - wanted annexation of anything, now or ever.
Most of us realized, sadly, that it was us or them. It was a choice
9
it seemed to us then as well as now - between having people who mean us no good developing and passing an annexation plan, and having the elected representatives of the city's Black population seize the initiative and try to do it ourselves. This we have done.
One final note ought to suggest that no one - not Sam Massell or Leroy Johnson or Julian Bond or the angered white representatives of Sandy Springs or the South Fulton Community can guarantee that our plan - or any plan will pass.
We think that a danger exists that something bad may happen, and we have moved to do somethinggood.
If nothing at all happens at all, then we will have all had time to stop and think. Time to insure that annexation or not, we can seriously get about the business of registering to vote, of organizing block by block and precinct by precinct to insure that there will never be another election like the scandolous one in 1968, where 30,000 Black people stayed at home and insured the re-election of Fletcher Thompson.
It would be a safe bet that up to one third of the Black people in this room are not registered to vote. Perhaps future Hungry Club sessions should be restricted to those who can produce a valid voter's card, or because this is that season of the year, a voter's card and a membership in the Butler
10
Street YMCA.
But that is the subject of another day.
Let me leave you withsome words from W. E. B. DuBois. Speaking in 1934 on the theme: ""A Negro Nation Within the Nation"", he said:
""Negroes and other colored folk exist in larger and growing numbers. Slavery, prostitution to white men,theft of their labor and goods have not killed them and will not kill them. They are growing in intelligence and in dissatisfaction. They occuoy strategic positions, within nations and beside nations, amid valuable raw material and on the highway to future expansion. They will survive, but onwhat terms and what conditions? .........With the use of their political power, their power as consumers, and their brainpower, .......Negroes can develop in the United States a nation within a nation.""
We must develop a city within this city, with or without Sandy Spring with or without the Fulton Industrial District, with or without any immediate changes in our political fortunes.
We can begin by trying to control our own politics. We can begin by supportingour own institutions, like the YMCA. We can begin by constroling our own money, by spending our dollarswhere they will come back to us.
11
We can begin by policing our own community, letting the sellers of poison to our children know that the price of drugs is death.
We can begin by getting ourselves together.

The confusion doesn't exist because we don't know what our problems are; it exists only because we either profess ignorance about methods of solving them, or have no real interest in having them solved. 
The confusion surrounding Black people, and our traditional difficulties with the so-called American way of life stems from our status in this country as a colonial people, and from the fact that we are increasingly being forced to employ the traditional methods and techniques of the colonial subject to escape from the oppression of the colonial power.
There are always objections made to the descriptions of ""us"" and ""them"" as components of the colonial equation; the argument runs this way:
2
First we are told that we are nationalized Americans, and not a people of separate identity. We are told that the Constitution of the United States supports equal citizenship, and that our sub constitutional status is a matter of chance, and not design. And we are told that the racism which affects us is based on historical preference and not economic profit, as it has been in the historical model of African, Asian, and Latin American colonialism.
But we are citizens only in the narrow sense in that we must meet certain obligations to the state, without receiving all of the corresponding benefits of citizenship. We all pay taxes, but because more of us are poor, and because the poor pay more, and because some of the rich pay nothing, we pay more of our share for less of the rewards taxpayers rightfully expect.
Black and white men alike are subjected to the opportunity to serve this country militarily, but through this present attack by our country on the people of Southeast Asia, we have managed to become 
3
first in war, last in peace, and seldom in the hearts of our countrymen.
While We -- like most other Americans -- came here as immigrants, but most immigrants came voluntarily, seeking freedom and a chance to survive. My ancestors came in chains, husband torn from wife, child from mother. 
In a land where family and education are venerated, we were denied the chance to learn to maintain a stable family unit. In a country populated with sufferers from religious prosecution persecution, we found a strange and alien religion forced upon us. 
While we came from a land whose inhabitants believed in communalism and the extended family, we found created here a system of mercantile capitalism that exactly fitted the cash box mentality of the founding fathers.
From that day to this, the separate status of Black people here has been a fact. From that day to this, we have been the Africans, suffering at the hands of the Europeans.
4
The argument is also made that Blacks enjoy legal status here as do all Americans. Of course, on paper, that is largely true, but the plain facts are that certain constitutionally guaranteed rights -- the right to vote and to enjoy other forms of social and political participation -- are still subjected to intense debate, not only in the southern states but in the White House itself.
In short, we are in bad shape. We live and work in situations provided for by the majority, not by us. We exist at the pleasure and sufferance of the American majority, and the evidence is mounting that that existence itself may soon be called into question. 
Part of the difficulty is that the traditional solutions to our dilemma -- solutions employed with great success by other ethnic groups -- will not mold themselves entirely to our deliverance. 
Individual entrepreneurship has created a class of Black millionaires in publishing, insurance and the cosmetic fields, but
5
has done little for the economic uplift of most Black people.
Pressure group politics has won many needed reforms for our group, but these reforms are nearly impossible to make secure in a colonial society.
We had believed, for instance, that the battle for the integrated schoolroom seat was won in 1954, with only slight pressure needed from then on to finish the job.
The truth was that none of the administrators in Washington since then -- particularly including this one -- ever intended to make the dream of an integrated education a reality.
The traditional coalitions of Black people, labor, the more enlightened church leadership have failed in bringing about the beloved society that was the dream of the early '60's. 
The American Labor Movement has begun to show its true colors as Black people began demanding not only labor connected goals like minimum wages, but entry into the craft unions which have always been
6
lily white. The churches at their worst have all too often played a gadfly role; Black people today, the war in Vietnam tomorrow, abortion reform the next. 
The hoped-for coalition with white college students has failed to materialize, as far too many of this group have shown more interest in music, drugs, the romantic rhetoric of revolution and the enobling sacrifice of self-enforced poverty then in the very real problems of existence that afflict most Black people in this country.
So we are left to an ever spiraling scale of politics and then protest and then revolt, with the probable result that increasing repression will follow.
Here is a description of the process:
""The people with the fewest illusions about the welfare state are the poor who are served by it. When they protest, usually in the name of American ideals, an interesting reaction follows. Some among the
7
majority react sympathetically, though not always with real understanding of the causes. But a sufficient number of opposing interests are aroused to prevent any drastic change, and often even moderate changes are blocked. The poor, who in most cases begin by politely petitioning their governors, soon take more drastic steps, thinking they can perhaps awaken the conscience of the majority or at least of higher authorities. They do awaken the conscience of some people, and to some extent they force elites to concede token changes. But at the same time, a 'counterrevolution' is triggerd against the potential of revolution which has been seen in the mounting protest. The system becomes deadlocked. No more than token reforms, crumbs, result from the protestors. The scale of their protest increases as they realize that appeals to conscience are inadequate. They look for methods of transcending the pressure politics that have not worked. They begin civil disobedience and disruption. The immediate reaction of the power structure is to maintain order. The police are brought
8
into the conflict, considerations of social, political or economic solutions to the conflict are gradually replaced by the emphasis on law and order. Violent repression becomes routine.""1
It becomes clear from analysis that the only escape from this trap is revolution, either violent on the part of both sides of the question, or a revolution in thinking, psychology and political position on at least one side.
It is that second revolution that is bursting upon us today.
It springs, first of all, from the Black community. It is a revolution in thinking about ourselves, a revolution turning upside down the analysis that hade made us -- the victims -- describe ourselves as the causes of our own condition.
It is found most concretely in the growing desire among Black people to reject the kind of tribalization of class and geography that has divided us for so long, and to bring us together as a
9
nation within the nation.
It is found in the rejection by Black people of white standards of beauty and qualification that have plagued us for so long.
But that cultural + psychological revolution will not do the job alone. We may -- as we are slowly about to do -- take over the major cities of this country and hold them as enclaves against increasing repression, charging admission fees to suburban whites who must come to the city for jobs and income, and who must depend on the city as a source of police protection and utility service.
But we would also like to depend on white America as a source of simple decency of treatment, a hope that many would call extremely naive.
We would like, for example, to be treated as well as American farmers are. First they were given free lands. Then they were given low interest loans to enable them to buy farm machinery. Then the Department of Agriculture sent out farm agents to show them
10
how to use their machines and to rotate their crops. Now we pay them not to do anything, a form of millionaire welfarism that is scorned for poor people.
Suppose, for example, that an ADC mother was paid not to produce at the same rate that the gentlman farmer from Mississippi Senator James O. Eastland is. That would mean that welfare mothers in Detroit or Chicago or Los Angeles could collect as much as $125,000 a year for not having babies.
But the revolution demands that we be allowed not more than, but simply the same as other groups. Why, we ask, must patronage be abolished as a political reward when Blacks take over the cities after political favoritism has done so much for Italians and Irishmen? Why must good government advocate metropolitanism as a panacea to urban ills at a time when we are about to take over some cities?
Why must some women -- most of them white -- and some homosexuals -- most of them white -- and some other groups insist that our liberation is dependent upon theirs?
11
The answer must be that no one -- unless it is American Indians -- has priority over the justifiable demands of Black people. And that only Black people can set the pace, techniques and methods used by Black people in our struggle.
Foremost among these must be a political action, but not the old style of machine politics of the unequal Black -- labor -- liberal - coalition that we have entered into like a willing bridegroom so many times in the past, only to emerge ravished and our innocence gone.
Our politics must be an aggressive independent politics, free from any alliances of party or partisanship that has made us slaves first to the party of Lincoln and now to the party of Roosevelt.
We must begin to seize power where we are, in the cities and the Black Belt counties of the Old Confederacy. As whites flee these ares for the comfort and security of the suburbs, they create a political vacuum that we must fill.
12
But the cities are crumbling beneath us, and the presence of a Black mayor alone will not insure that these decaying compounds will be liveable again.
The Black inhabitants of rural America have a better chance at achieving a decent life, for the cost of living is lower there and the people know better how to live, but even these victors will discover that political gains can be destroyed by an economy that still remains in the hands of the plantation bosses.
So, as we get our politics together, we must try to get our economics together as well.
This means that while we reject the obviously absurd Nixonian notion of Black capitalism, we must not hesitate to accept any economic advantage that might accrue to our group as a whole. This means striving for economic plans as different as the designs plotted by the Honorable Elijah Muhammad in the South to the
13
neighborhood cooperatives springing up in ghettoes across the country; to the transfer of mom-and-pop stores from white hands to Black ones; as well as any other plan or scheme that will put money into the pockets of Black people.
It means that we cannot afford the luxury available to so many dilettantes who seek to define for us what is right and what is wrong - indeed, even what is Black, in our struggle. At the time when our community seems about to draw together an alliance of cultural nationalists and political activists, of poverty workers and poverty livers, of foot washing Baptists and the Nation of Islam, we cannot afford a Woodstock in a nation that still tolerates Watts; we cannot demand liberation for special groups until the whole group goes free.
That suggests that the fragile, sometime security of the college campus is not the proper place from which to engage in remote criticism of people who seldom see a book from year to year; that the presence of ROTC on the campus is not nearly as earthshaking an issue
14
as the presence of rats in the ghetto; that debates about the relative revisionism of the late Ho Chi Minh had best be neglected until we have started our own revolution here.
Finally, we must prepare for a time of trouble. If the provisions of the criminally insane Washington, D. C. Crime Act are any indication, or the unwillingness of the House Internal Security Committee to help abolish the concentration camp features of the McCarran Act are a signal for the future, then we had better beware and prepare for hard times ahead.
Through these hard times, we might prepare ourselves with the words of Frederick Douglass, who in 1894 was asked how the race problem might be solved. He said then:
""Let the white people of the North and South conquer their prejudices . . . . Let the American people cultivate kindness and humanity . . . . Let them give up the idea that they can be free
15
while making the Negro a slave. Let them give up the idea that to degrade the colored man is to elevate the white man . . . .
""They are not required to do much. They are only required to undo the evil that they have done, in order to solve their problem. . . .
""Put away your race prejudice. Banish the idea that one class must rule over another. Recognize the fact that the rights of the humblest of citizens are as worthy of recognition as the rights of the highest, and your problem will be solved, and -- whatever may be in store for you in the future, whether prosperity or adversity, whether you have foes without or foes within, whether there shall be peace or war -- based on the eternal principle of truth, justice and humanity, with no class having cause for complaint or grievance, your republic will stand and flourish forever.""2

They look for methods of transcending the pressure politics that have not worked. They begin civil disobedience and disruption. The immediate reaction of the power structure is to maintain order. The police are brought
8
into the conflict. Considerations of social, political or economic solutions to the conflict are gradually replaced by the empahsis on law and order. Violent repression becomes routine.""1
It becomes clear from that analysis that the only escape from this trap is revolution, either violent on the part of both sides of the question, or a revolution in thinking, psychology and political position on at least one side.
It is that second revolution that is bursting upon us today.
It springs, first of all, from the Black community. It is a revolution in thinking about ourselves, a revolution turning upside down the perverse analysis that hade made us -- the victims -- describe ourselves as the causes of our own condition. 
It is found most concretely in the growing desire among Black people to reject the kind of tribalization of class and geography that has divided us for so long, and is found in the impulse to bring us together as a
9
nation within this nation. 
It is found in the rejection by Black people of white European standards of beauty and qualification that have plagued us for so long.
But that will not do the job alone. We may -- as we are slowly about to do -- take over the major cities of this country and hold them as enclaves against increasing repression, charging admission fees to suburban whites who must come to the city for jobs and income, and who must depend on the city as a source of police protection and utility service.
But we should also like to depend on white America as a source of simple decency of treatment, a hope that many would call extremely naive.
We would like, for example, to be treated as well as American farmers are. First they were given free lands. Then they were given low interest loans to enable them to buy farm machinery. Then the Department of Agriculture sent out farm agents to show them
10
how to use their machines to rotate their crops. Now we pay them not to do anything, a form of millionaire welfarism that is scorned for poor people.
Suppose, for example, that an ADC mother was paid to produce at the same rate that the gentlman farmer Senator James O. Eastland is. That would mean that welfare mothers in Detroit or Chicago or Los Angeles could collect as much as $125,000 a year for not having babies.
But the revolution demands that we be allowed not more than, but simply the same as other groups. Why, we ask, must patronage be abolished as a political reward when Blacks take over the cities after political favoritism has done so much for Italians and Irishmen? Why must good government advocate metropolitanism as a panacea to urban ills at a time when we are about to take over some cities?
Why must some women -- most of the white -- and some homosexuals -- most of them white -- and some other groups insist that our liberation is dependent upon theirs?
11
The answer must be that no one -- unless it is American Indians - has priority over the justifiable demands of Black people. And that only Black people can set the pace, techniques and methods used by Black people in our struggle.
Foremost among these must be political action, but not the old style of machine politics of the unequal Black -- labor -- liberal -- coalition that we have entered into like a willing bridegroom so many times in the past, only to emerge ravished and our innocence gone.
Our politics must be an aggressive independent politics, free from any alliances of party or partisanship that has made us slaves first to the party of Lincoln and now to the party of Roosevelt.
We must begin to seize power where we are, in the cities and the Black Belt counties of the Old Confederacy. As whites flee these areas for the comfort and security of the suburbs, they create a political vacuum that we must fill.
12
But the cities are crumbling beneath us, and the presence of a Black mayor alone will not insure that these decaying compounds will be liveable again.
The Black inhabitants of rural America have a better chance at achieving a decent life, for the cost of living is lower there and the people know better how to live, but even these victors will discover that their political gains can be destroyed by an economy that still remains in the hands of the plantation bosses.
So, as we get our politics together, we must try to get our economics together as well.
This means that while we reject the obviously absurd Nixonian notion of Black capitalism, we must not hesitate to accept any economic advantage that might accrue to our group as a whole.
This means striving for economic plans as different as the designs plotted by the Honorable Elijah Muhammad in the South to the
13
neighborhood cooperatives springing up in ghettoes across the country; to the transfer of mom-and-op stores from white hands to Black ones; as well as any other plan or scheme that will put money into the pockets of Black people.
It means that we cannot afford the luxury available to so many dilettantes who seek to define for us what is right and what is wrong -- indeed, even what is Black, in our struggle. At a time when our community seems about to draw together an alliance of cultural nationalists and political activists, of povery workers and poverty livers, of foot washing Baptists and the Nation of Islam, we cannot afford a Woodstock in a nation that still tolerates Watts; we cannot demand liberation for special groups until the whole group goes free.
That suggests that the fragile, sometime security of the college campus is not the proper place from which to engage in remote criticism of people who seldom see a book from year to year; that the presence of ROTC on the campus is not nearly as earthshaking an issue
14
as the presence of rats in the ghetto; that debates about the relative revisionism of the late Ho Chi Minh had best be neglected until we have started our own revolution here.
Finally, we must prepare for a time of trouble. If the provisions of the criminally insane Washington, D. C. Crime Act are any indication, or the unwillingness of the House Internal Security Committee to help abolish the concentration camp features of the McCarran Act are a signal for the future, then we had better beware and prepare for hard times ahead.
Through these hard times, we might prepare ourselves with the words of Frederick Douglass, who in 1894 was asked how the race problem might be solved. He said then:
""Let the white people of the North and South conquer their prejudices . . . . Let the American people cultivate kindness and humanity . . . . Let them give up the idea tht they can be free
15
while making the Negro a slave. Let them give up the idea that to degrade the colored man is to elevate the white man . . . .
""They are not required to do much. They are only required to undo the evil they have done. In order to solve their problem . . . .
""Put away your race prejudice. Banish the idea that one class must rule over another. Recognize the fact that the rights of the humblest of citizens are as worthy of recognition as the rights of the highest, and your problem will be solved, and -- whatever may be in store for you in the future, whether prosperity or adversity, whether you have foes without or within, whether there shall be peace or war -- based on the general principles of truth, justice and humanity, with no class having cause for complaint or grievance, your republic will stand and flourish forever.""2

First of all, I owe a large sum of money to two white banks.
Next, I am a former entrepreneur who owned two businesses. I sold my interest in one to my partner for one dollar, and he in turn sold the entire company to a third party for over 10 thousand dollars.
In my other venture, a fast food operation with two others, where I was the only cash investor, the business folded and one of my former associates is suing me for $192 thousand dollars.
Finally, I am a friend of Earl Graves.
1
There is currently has been much discussion about Black business in recent years--manufacturers, retail stores, construction companies and more, including banks
The concept is simple. Black people must control more of the dollars going in and out of the Black community.
Black businesses had total sales in 1969 of $4 1/2 billion--an impressive figure until we remember that these were the total revenues from 163,000
2
businesses, or only $28,000 per firm.
That is simply not economic power--power comes when you have 5 or 10 firms with revenues of 500 million, not from 163,000 small enterprises. That is why financial enterprises like yours are so important.
More than 100 banks, savings and loans institutions and insurance companies control about $1 billion in assets.
That is potential economic muscle.
3
There is no doubt that your numbers are growing, from 7 Black banks in 1946 to 31 today, with another dozen planned for the future. Your assets grew from $200 million in 1968 to about $500 million today.
The picture is not entirely rosy. Your combined assets are less than the assets of the bank ranked number 50 on the Fortune list of top U. S. banking institutions.
We know also that your banks are less profitable--accounts are smaller and riskier,
4
more personnel are needed for your operations than for comparable white banks and you find it harder to make good loans. Your personnell, trained at great expense, is lured away. The friend you have at Chase Manhattan may be the teller you hired last year.
5
Minority banks find it harder to make good loans, so, more of their assets are tied up in lower profit government securities.
When after considerable expense, personnel have been trained they are often lured away by the higher salaries paid by the larger banks.
So, where do we stand all today?
I believe, as I know you do, that black banks must grow and prosper as an integral part of a prosperous black community. The two go hand in hand.
As a politician I ask myself what can and should government be doing to help that growth?
More specifically, what has this government done during the past four years to help Blacks--Black people, Black businessmen and Black bankers?
I believe that the Nixon administration has adopted policies which are not only tokenist in their inability to get at the root of our problems but which are actually divisive for the black community.
What does Nixon say he has done? In the latest fiscal year, I believe that about $500 million in loans, loan guarantees and grants have been made to minority businesses. An impressive
6
figure--but remember, there are 322,000 minority firms. This works out to $1,553 per firm. Remember also, that two big corporations alone, Penn Central and Lockheed, have received $350 million in loan guarantees from the federal government.
Nixon tells you that by June 1972 federal deposits in minority banks will amount to more than $100 million, more than three times the target set in 1970. Again, this sounds fine but when minority bankers have to tie up their money by pledging government securities equal to the amount of federal government deposits, I wonder how much of those government deposits will end up as loans made to black homeowners or black businessmen.
Federal government defense contracts with corporations amounted to 31 billion dollars in 1970. Why doesn't the government use its influence with these firms to increase their use of minority banks?
So far, what I've said merely suggests that like many prior governments, the Nixon administration is telling us about major achievements when the record shows something quite different.
But I believe the this administration is following policies that are not only inadequate but actually divisive. Why? The Nixon administration has always said it will do more for the black businessman. It has said it favors work not welfare
7
--Black businesses, not handouts. So the impression is created that Nixon is helping the middle class black and creating a setup in which even the poorest families can prosper.
But as I have said already--there really has been only token aid to black businesses and there have been cutbacks, and widespread abandoning of poverty programs, OEO legal services, the Job Corps and Headstart. The result--poor blacks think black businessmen and black bankers are suddenly getting government aid. Black businessmen and bankers see Nixon's figures but they know that government press releases do not improve profits.
There is a serious danger that black people will lose the unity developed at such cost in recent years, because now a few of us are making it with Nixon's money.
Why is Nixon's approach totally wrong and why will it never help black businessmen or black bankers?
Before I answer that, let me remind you of a few familiar statistics. Black median income in 1971 in the United States was $6,440 per family. In 1959 the average black family earned 51% of the white family's earnings. By 1968 black
8
median income had risen to 60% of white median income. At the end of 1971, after three years of the Nixon administration, what was this figure? It remained at 60%. In other words, black families have not improved their position in 3 years after showing significant growth during the preceding 8 years of a Democratic other Administrations.
Minority unemployment in 1971 averaged 9.9% compared to 6.7% in 1968. Nine hundred thousand minority workers were without a job in 1971 compared to 600,000 in 1968--a 50% increase. The number of black persons living below the poverty level declined by 2.2 million between 1959 and 1968 and by only 200,000 between 1968 and 1971.
We know that the number of black upper income families is increasing dramatically. But we also know that we have a long way to go.
None of this information is new. We have all heard it before in speeches and read it before in the newspaper.
Why am I repeating it?
Because, and this is the crux of what I am saying today, most black businessmen and most black bankers must rely on the black community as a basis for their prosperity.
9
Black firms cannot isolate themselves. They need white customers and white personnel. Black banks need to make loans to white firms. But this will be a long developing process. At present, if black banks cannot loan to black businesses and homeowners, then those people must turn to white banks, where they will often be refused.
If loans are not made, then businesses cannot grow and consumers cannot buy homes , appliances, and cars. So you see a vicious circle is operating. It forces black banks to make smaller, riskier and less profitable loans.
You know that you must break out of this circle and that your problem is to find good sound loans to make, whether to a black businessman or a black homeowner.
But I am telling you that no matter how efficient you become, how many computers you use, how many consultants you hire, you will not make money in the banking business or any other business unless your customers have the money to buy your goods and your services.
Dr. Charles Walker, the Under Secretary of the Treasury, made a speech in July of this year to a senior management seminar of your association: If I may quote him,"

It does not present a pretty picture.
The long fingers of American might are still sticking in other people's pies. More than 300,000 American soldiers are still engaged in trying to tell the Vietnamese people what kind of government they can have and under what circumstances.
Here at home, the streets campuses of America have not barely quieted down from last summer semester, and the upcoming ones promises to be just as long and may be just as hot.
2
On the campus, attempts at reform are rebuffed, and attempts at revolution are suppressed. Young people have discovered that our finest universities hold investments in slave mines, or research the best ways to defoliate jungles and people.
All Americans have learned over the past several months years that the machinery that we were told was build to protect us - college deans and their machinery, county sheriffs and their machinery, political parties and their machinery, American presidents and their machinery - were in fact bent on suppressing those with whom they dealt.
We repudiated in 1968 a potential president of the type who preached peace and practiced war. We elected one who has yet to demonstrate he has any concern for the poor and the Black.
For some Americans in 1968 the 1960s, politics failed completely.
3
One potential candidate in 1968 fell victim to an assasin's bullet; another was stilled by parliamentary democracy.
But some lessons didn't have to be learned.
It didn't take a Kerner report for Black people to discover that white people were our problem, and not we theirs.
It didn't take Eugene McCarthy for some Americans to see that war against liberation and people in Southeast Asia was wrong, and it took only a few hours last in August of 1968 in Chicago and Prague, to see that machines will crush liberty wherever it appears.
But overall, the sixties were a learning year decade, young whites learned .. and are still learning .. their lessons against trustees and regents and deans. Older people learned it against the county chairman and the ward boss. Blacks learned it against white people.
4
The lessons learned were simple. An old Black abolitionist, Frederick Douglass, stated it well when he said: ""Power concedes nothing without a demand; it never has and never will. Find out just what any people will quietly submit to, and you have discovered the exact measure of injustice and wrong which will be imposed upon them, and these will continue until they are resisted with either words, or blows, or both. The limits of tyrants are prescribed by the endurance of those whom they oppress.""
We must continue to fight the battles still to be fought and won. The continuing battle against fascism will be most difficult. The police state tactics which began in the South against Blacks, were transferred to the campus for use against students, into the streets of Chicago for use against everyone, and which are now being
5
aimed at militant groups like the Panthers must be halted.
The use of the courts and law and order as an instrument of repression can be seen nowhere as clearly as in the persecution of Dr. Spock and in the curious case now going that went on in Chicago, in which eight people are were charged with the unlikely offense of conspiring to incite the Chicago police to riot.
Another struggle which has to be supported is the battle to halt welfare programs for rich people. This must be the only country in the world which runs its economy on capitalism for poor people and socialism for rich people.
We annually spend more money on pet food than we do on food stamps. We pour vast federal subsidies into the oil industry and the cotton industry. We gave gentleman farmer Senator James O. Eastland $140,000 in farm subsidies, in effect paying him for doing nothing. But no one says Eastland is lazy, and shiftless and a welfare bum. Seme weeks ago The United States House
6
of Representatives voted recently to place a $20,000 limit on the amount of money a farmer could receive for doing nothing; when will they begin to think about paying $20,000 a year to families, the poor and the Black, who cannot do for themselves?
Black people are seeing a real wave of racism sweeping the country. The recent elections in Los Angeles, Milwaukee and New York across the country have clearly demonstrated that race is not an issue in southern politics alone, but that it is an issue and will be an issue in every municipal and county and state election for some time in the future. In 1970 This year there will is be an opportunity to replace some of the worst racists and military merchants in Congress. Some of our larger American cities are turning Black; we will have the opportunity to put decent men in mayors' chairs all over this nation, but only if we get ourselves together.
7
There are other attacks being made on us. The federal government and the little tyrant who runs the FBI have given notice they believe they can with impunity listen in on the conversation of anyone in the United States. Just this last summer, they admitted they planted bugs in the telephone, the living room and the automobile of one of our religious leaders, the honorable Elijah Muhammad. They admitted they bugged the conversations and hotel rooms of the late Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. The next time you call someone, or have a conversation with someone that you think is private, ask yourself whether Attorney General Mitchell and J. Edgar Hoover are listening in.
Over the last few weeks months, we have seen a series of vicious and well coordinated attacks made made by local policemen
8
and the FBI on the Black Panther Party, one of the vanguard organizations in the Black Liberation Struggle. Their leaders have been arrested, their offices ransacked. You may not care what happens to the Black Panthers, although you should, but if you don't speak out when the Panthers are attacked, ask yourself, who will speak out for you?
And while Senator Thurmond, the the real political Christine Jorgenson Cinderella bridegroom from South Carolina, continues to subvert school education integration in the South, we must continue to fight that battle as well.
While the President of the United States and the puppet dictator of south Vietnam still continue to deny freedom of choice to the people of Southeast Asia, and while this government squanders money on the ABM (America's Biggest Mistake), we must continue to demand that men on earth receive equal treatment with men on the moon, and that there are 25 million poor people here who demand
9
that a war be fought at home, with just as much vigor and money as the war against people in Southeast Asia.
And when serious demands are made by serious people on some of the wealthiest financial institutions in the United States, the religious establishment, we have to fight to win that battle too. Don't let anyone tell you that the money will be used to line someone's pocket; we are demanding reparations to the tune of $15 a nigger, reparations to build a southern land bank, to build a Black publishing house, to help finance education for Black professionals, for the National Welfare Rights Organization. That battle must be fought as well, and when it is won, then American business must face our demands too.
You ought to face up to that demand. It is a right one. It is a just one. It is a proper one. Just remember, if you have any fondness for organized religion in this country, it was
10
the Christian church that brought my ancestors here in order to civilise them, and when the church came to Africa, we had the land and they had the Bible. Now all we have is the Bible.
Our difficulty is that we have no way to control or influence the several ways in which decision making in this society is ordered; we have little or no access to ""power centers"" in America.
The ""power centers"" are several; they include private wealth; the nation's 25 largest corporations (the annual revenues of General Motors are larger than the Gross National Product of all but the fifteen largest nations of the world); the military/industrial/labor complex, which overlaps with the corporations; the federal and state governmental apparatus and organized crime.1
We are denied access to these centers of power precisely
11
because when America was being divided and raped, we were not in a position to divide or rape but were instead being raped ourselves. Today we lack access to these centers of power because we are too small a group, too geographically dispersed.2
The prospects - or even the desirability of our taking over one or more of these centers of power is slim. We must then prepare to deal with the possibility that only limited advantages are possible for us as a group while we remain tied to white America.
(Separatism, or more properly partition, [would] might solve some of these problems for us; it is, however, a long range
12
prospect. Planning for it ought not get in the way of whatever limited gains are possible now).
Minimal control of the resources, goods, institutions, services, the regulation of the flow of capital in and out of our community is a must.
What we need is not Black capitalism but what could more properly called community socialism, so that we may have profit for the many instead of the few, so that neighborhoods and communities shall have the major say in who gets what from whom.
We need to find ways to control what we can. That means our politics as well as our economy. We need to seek out whatever allies are available, brown, yellow, red or Black or white, on whatever issues appeals to us all.
One ray of hope could be offered by our young, those who are
13
now occassionally engaged in restructuring the university. There is a task waiting them outside the ivy covered walls of American education. There sit the millions, squeezed into slums, working if they work at all for pennies, being educated, if they are educated at all, to push mops and brooms, waiting and hoping for some salvation.
Of course, some do not wait at all, but are engaged every summer in restructuring the American slum.
But the young, after winning whatever victory is available on the playing fields of Harvard and Columbia, have a job to do. The job is physical, rather than verbal. The rhetoric heard from the campus and street corner has little meaning to a starving child or an unemployed father. That rhetoric must be made into a reality. If it is not, then we shall reap the whirlwind.
Finally, let us consider what kind of new movement can be built in this country. It is being built now, built by those who
14
were not frightened into inaction by the Meredith March new agressiveness of Black people built by those who were told to organize their own, and did so, built by those who felt that both inside and outside the Chicago Convention, nothing was happening, those are building on the ashes of the 1964 drive by Black and white college students to build a people's movement, a people's politics in America.
That movement faltered then. But it brought forth some hope. Hope which springs from American history which is not taught in any school, hope which suggests that a better day might just be possible, if the energy put into building it becomes equal to the energy put into discussing it.
Its possibility makes chilling the prediction of a Black Georgian, who, writing nearly 100 years ago, suggested a kind of struggle that ought to strike fear in the hearts and
15
minds of the kinds of comfortable people who come to hear - and perhaps applaud - speakers like myself.
He wrote in 1884:
"". . . The future struggle in the South will be, not between white man and Black man, but between capital and labor, landlord and tenant. The hour is approaching when the laboring classes of this country, North, East, West and South, will recognize they have a common cause and a common enemy; and that therefore, if they would triumph over wrong and place the laurel wreath upon triumphant justice, without distinction of race or previous condition, they must unite. When the issue is properly joined, the rich, whether they be a Black or white, will be found on one side . . . and the poor, be they Black or be they white, will be found on the other.

As John Lewis has told you it is a great pleasure for both of us to be here. We are spending these three days in the State of Alabama, traveling on the nonpartisan voter registration tour and trying to place a particular emphasis on young people like yourselves. We don't come here to tell you to join one of the two political parties, Democrans or Republicrats. We are not here to tell you to vote for this candidate or that candidate. We think you knew how to make up your minds about those things a long time  before we came. We do come, however, to urge you to involve yourselves in politics, in the process of deciding what your life will be. As John Lewis said, the decade of the 1960's has brought a great many changes for us. In the early 1960's, it was young people like yourselves from colleges like this one who marched and demonstrated and protested and boycotted and finally won the right to sit at lunch counters. A very important victory for us but certainly not the most important thing in the world. Even more important than being able to sit at lunch counters is to be able to stand up and pay for what you ate when you sat down. That's a difficult task for many of our people, because many of us are poor people. We are people who have champagne appetites, but a lot of us only have Ripple pocketbooks. Once again, it was young people like yourselves who worked the Freedom Rides, who rode on buses from Washington, D. C. down through the Carolinas, into Georgia and Alabama is who faced violence and terror in this state
2
and long prison terms in the State of Mississippi, but who finally forced the federal government to declare that segregation in interstate travel was [legal] illegal, and to win for black people the right to sit anyplace on a bus that we wished. Well, that was certainly an important victory: But, again, it was not the most important victory in the world. Because a lot of us are people who aren't going anywhere. We are not going by plane, we are not going by boat, we are not going by train, we are not going by bus. That is particularly true for a group of people who won't even take the time to go down to the courthouse to register to vote. But again it was young people who, after having eliminated segregation at the lunch counters, after eliminating segregation at the bus stations and buses, began to embark on a serious drive to integrate the voting booths and the ballot boxes at the county courthouses all across the southern part of the United States, and once again they demonstrated, they marched, they suffered, they sacrificed. All their efforts climaxed in 1965 in the march from Selma to Montgomery. President Johnson signed into law the 1965 Voting Rights Act. Now, with few exceptions, there are no reasons why Black people in the South can't register and vote. Again it was young people who, over the last few years, agitated and marched and demonstrated and won for themselves the right to register and vote at 18, and that was a tremendous victory. What needs to be done in the decade of the 1970s is to see if young people cannot put together all of the victories
3
won over the past several years and make them real for Black people everywhere.
So we come into the State of Alabama to fulfill the role in 1970 and 1972 that young people fulfilled in the 1960's, and that is to once again become the cutting edge, the leading point for black people for civic, political and educational liberties. We urge you to do that by involving yourself in politics, and we know that a great many young people, particularly Black people, have no use for politics or politicians. Now I am very proud to be a politician: I'm very proud to be a member of the world's second oldest profession: I'm very proud to say that I am a politician! A great many politicians will come before you and tell you that they are statesmen. A statesmen is just a politician who can't get elected. I am a politician: We think part of the reason why young people don't like politics is that they don't have a clear definition of what it is. Politics is not the art of the possible, as a great many of you were taught in high school civics. Politics isn't the art of compromise as some of you may have learned in Political Science 101, which is just civics taught by an older man. Politics is not either one of those things. It is, instead, a different kind of art. Politics is the art of seeing who gets how much of what from whom. If politics is understood to be the art of who gets how much from whom, then it ought to be clear that black and poor people are the who, who haven't got any of anything from you know who.

Politics is one of the important forces in the world. It's politics that decides what kind of life if any you will have, what kind of world, if any, you will live in, what kind of future, if any, your children will have. If when you graduate from this school and go into teaching, it's politics that decides what kind of salary you will get, how many pupils per classroom you will teach. It's politics that decides what the speed limit will be on the street, and if you break the speed limit and ""Johnny Be Good"" pulls you over, it's politics that decides whether or not he says, ""Come here girl,"" or ""Come here boy,"" or whether he says, ""Excuse me madam. I noticed that your vehicle was traveling a trifle in excess of the posted speed limit, and I hope that you won't do it again."" It's politics that has snatched young men from this campus, sent them thousands of miles from their homes to shoot and kill and be killed by other mothers'????? sons. It's politics that takes black young men and puts them in the service where they are first in war and last in peace, and seldom in the hearts of their countrymen. It's politics that makes us the last to be hired and the first to be fired. It's politics that gives black children 12 years of school, but only 6 years of education. It's politics, which in this part of the United States, in the Southeast, has ruined many black educators, has made the black man, who last year was the principal of Booker T. Washington High School, this year is the assistant to the assistant to the assistant. One of the nicest things about politics is that it is not compulsory. You don't have to do it: You don't have to get involved in it:
5
If you want the people who have been running your business for 352 years to keep on doing so, they will be glad to do so. They like doing it. They love doing it. They get their cookies from doing it. They have been doing it for so long, that they think God ordained in his heaven for them to do it. But you know we are suppose to be, and I think we are, a kind and compassionate people. We should have pity on some of these people who have been suffering in public office in Alabama for so long. Let them go home and sit on their front steps, and watch the world go by. Why can't we get a chance to see if we can't direct the fortunes of the ship of state. Now politics, as I said, is something we don't have to do. If you want things to be on the day after tomorrow the same as they were the day before yesterday, then all you must do is nothing, and I guarantee that not only will they be exactly the same, but they will be worse. But you ought to try it, you never know, you might like it. What we are asking you to do is really two things. One is mental and the other is physical. The physical thing we are asking you to do is to overcome the notion that a lot of us have that the white man's ice is colder, that his sugar is sweeter, or his ..?  ?
We have got to get away from the idea that we can't do things ourselves. That is the whole purpose of your being educated young men and women, to demonstrate that you not only have the training and but the innate ability to do for yourselves what you wish. We are asking you to overcome the notion that says that people on the college campus don't get involved
6
with people in the community. We are asking, as John said, that there be an end to the separation between the Ph.Ds and the no Ds. We are asking that you involve yourselves in registering to vote, and then move out into the neighborhoods that surround this university to do for and with those people what you would have them do for and with you. To help put together in this city, in this country, in this congressional district, in this state, in this part of the United States a powerful group of black votes - black votes that can help determine who the next president of the United States will be, whether the man we have there now will [illegible] go on another four years, whether someone new will come along, who will represent you in the United States Senate, who is going to be your Congressman, who will be your mayor, your city councilman, your county commissioner, your sheriff. Now a lot of you may not think that's important. Who the President of the United States is is terribly, terribly important. Who is it that made John Mitchell the Attorney General of the United States? Whose Department of Injustice is it that tolerates murder at Attica, at San Quentin, at Jackson State and Kent. Who was it who gives the Cinderella Bridegroom????. Sen. Thurmond from South Carolina, veto power over judicial appointees in school integration? Who is it who's afraid of the hillbilly Hitler from Alabama? Who is it who tolerates J. Edgar Hoover's Federal Bureau of Intimidation? And who is it who lets them do the se these [men] things? It's the Congress of the United States, the representatives whose terms expire every two
7
years, the senators whose terms expire every six. You ought to check yours out. I'm a stranger here. For all I know they may be perfect. But if they aren't, you ought not to just chek check them out, you ought to kick them out. In 1968, out of a voting age population of about 120,000,000 people only 73,000,000 voted. President Nixon received about 33,000,000 or 34,000,000 votes, but half again as many people, 41,000,000 did not vote at all. Those figures can be reversed. The architects of the national southern strategy can be permanently retired from public office. It can be done by resurrecting in this country a movement led by and participated in by people like yourselves. You can do it, but you never will do it, you never will do it if you measure your social commitment by the length of your hair or the trickiness of your handshake, you never will do it if you can find escape from the real world cares of the real world in Big Wisk and Boone's Farm. It never will be done until you decide that you can do it yourself. Now we are about, on tomorrow, to have some difficulty with the mayor from Selma, but I understand his problem. He doesn't want people coming into his city because they might get in trouble. You know he went up to Washington, D. C. a couple of years ago looking for something that he should't have been looking for, and he got into trouble: He knows what it is to be in a strange city, and to be lonely, but he knows not to send anybody out after him it now. We have traveled all over the South. In most of the places we have been the government officials have been very friendly. Sometimes we have been a little nervous. Last summer we found
8
ourselves in Belzoni, Mississippi. I imagine that most of the younger people here have never heard of Belzoni, but people who are my age, I'm 32 and older, people who have worked with the NAACP know about Belzoni. You have heard the namesof of George Lee and Gus Courts, two men who were shot in Belzoni because they registered to vote. Belzoni is what they use to call a bad little town. There use to be a sign outside the city limits of Belzoni saying ""Nigger, read this sign and run."" Then when you got inside the city limits, there was another sign that said if you can't read, run anyway. That's the kind of place it was. John Lewis and myself found ourselves in the city of Belzoni last summer on a tour like this one in a small, black Baptist church. A very small church. I doubt if the people just sitting over here in this section of the stands could have fit in the church. But it had a central aisle like this, and double doors in the back. The minister was in the pulpit just getting ready to introduce us and we were sitting to his rear when the double doors in the back of the church opened and in walked this sort of healthy looking white man. I'm not the bravest man in the world so I grabbed the minister by the back of the coat, and I said, ""Who is this man.?"" But the minister didn't hear me and the man kept coming up the center aisle. I grabbed the pastor's coat and gave a little harder jerk and said in a louder voice, ""Who is that man ?!?"" But, he still didn't hear me and by this time the man jumped up in the pulpit, he grabbed John Lewis with one hand
9
and grabbed me with the other, and he said, ""Welcome to Belzoni."" He said, ""You two men are doing some wonderful work."" ""You are a credit to your race."" Well, if I had been thinking quickly, I would have said, ""You are a credit to yours."" But I turned and said to the minister once more, ""I said, who is this crazy man?"" The pastor said, ""Hush, son."" ""That's the Mayor of Belzoni."" I said, ""Does the Mayor of Belzoni always come out to voter registration rallies sponsored by the NAACP?"" And he said, ""To tell you the truth, we have never seen him before."" So I asked myself, what was it made this man get up from his supper table and leave his air-conditioned house to come out down this dusty road and come into this little church to shake hands with John Lewis and me. He didn't come down there to see me. He came so the people in the church and shake hands with John L could see him see me, because he liked being the Mayor of Belzoni. Now it's just like the people in that church had a weapon, a 2 by 4, and they had hit him over the head and the shoulders, and beat him up the street and beat him into the church, but the difference between this weapon and a 2 x 4 is that if you hit somebody over the head with a 2 by 4, the next morning they will have a hickey. But this weapon doesn't leave any visible marks. But if you hit someone hard enough with it, they will remember it for the rest of their natural born lives. That weapon is the vote. A vote is just like a leaf from a tree that falls to the ground. It has no life of its own. You have got to reach down and pick it up, and put it together with tens of hundreds of thousands of other votes, and then you have got something powerful. You have got the ability to make people do what you want them to do, and not to always have you doing what they want you to do. And that's all politics is. We hope you will involve yourselves in it. We believe that because this city, this campus has a tradition of struggle stretching back
10
many, many years, back into the 1950s and even beyond that, that you will not begin to let that tradition down. You know John Lewis and I are here today, and gone tomorrow. But on tomorrow you will all be here. And you will all be here on the day after that, and many of you will spend the rest of your lives in this state. And you can have it be the kind of state it is today, or you can work from now until then to make it the kind of state you want to see. It reminds me of a story that is told a great deal in the Baptist Church about an old deacon who use to go to church every single time he could, but the older he got, he began to go less and less, until he finally just stopped going all together. On the Sunday mornings when he should have been sitting on the first pew on the right hand side, he found himself out in the forests in the fi and the fields hunting. On one Sunday morning he was out with his shotgun, tripped over a stump, dropped his gun, and when he looked up, he was looking right in the face of a big, black, burly, grissly bear. Well he was an old man and he knew he couldn't outrun the bear, and he knew he couldn't run very far very fast, but he decided to run as far as he could, and he could feel the bear's hot breath on theback of hisreck on the back of his neck, and hear those great, sharp teeth just clicking just an inch away from the lobe of his ear, could feel those razor sharp claws just snapping at the cloth on the shirt on his back, and he decided that he would do something that he hadn't done in a long, long time, and tat that was to pray. So he threw his head back and the he threw up a prayer. He said, ""Lord, oh Lord, please help me."" He said, ""Please don't let this bear catch me."" Well, much to his great surprise, there was a tremendous clap of thunder, a bolt of lightning came from each of the four
11
directions of the compass, and a loud voice spoke out. The voice said, ""How dare you! "" It said, ""You haven't been to church in 25 years."" In fact, the voice said, ""the church has burned down once and moved twice."" The voice said, ""You haven't prayed in 25 years, and yet you have the nerve, the first prayer in all this time, is instead of giving a prayer for the salvation of men's souls or the elimination of injustice, hunger, and poverty, you have the nerve to pray to me to save your worthless neck."" The voice said, ""I wouldn't save you if you were the last human being on the face of the earth."" Well, I don't mind telling you that the old man's spirits fell. But he knew he could run a couple of feet further. By this time the bear was licking his ear, those sharp claws had just about torn the shirt off his back, that hot breath had straightened the hair on the back of his head, but he knew he could keep going for another two feet and he decided he would send up just one more prayer, so once again he lifted his voice to the heavens and he said, ""Lord, oh Lord, if you won't save me, he said ""Please, don't help that bear."" It seems to me that that is really the choice you have. You have the choice to continue as many other college students do in the 1970s carrying about nothing but yourselves, being more interested in music, or drugs or the romantic rhetoric of revolution, the ennobling sacrifice of self-enforced poverty, or you have the ability to do something for yourselves. To do something for people who are not as fortunate as you, and don't get your chance to come to a university, who won't, at the end ij of four years get that piece of parcl parchment which is a passport to a certain standard of life. You can make the choice yourself. I believe you will do the right thing, but whatever you do, please, please don't help that bear! Thank you."

one the point of today's concern of course is that the war does go on, that human life is still being lost, that prisoners of war are multiplying, that the incredible carnage and damage to civilian life and limb continue.
Our concern is to end the war now, and to begin the healing process that must be undertaken by the American people who must shoulder much of the blame for the criminally insane acts of a succession of our governments.
The American people may have had peake reached a their level of outrage and horror raised so high after years of napalm and saturation bombs and destruction of dykes and the elimination of whole villages that the death of a hospital may mean nothing to them.
If that is the case, then the greatest casualty of the war, aside from the human cost in lives and wounds, is the death of the American conscience, and the birth of a callousness brought about by too many years of [many] arrogant interference into the lif lives of people who have never committed an act of agression against us.

We are horrified and shamed by our country's ruthlessness in Vietnam, and our continuation of that war beyond any remnant of reason.
As citizens, we feel obligated to do all in our individual and joint power to stop these acts and the policies that direct them and to restore the peace and peaceful international behavior of this country.
We say plainly and emphatically to all Congressmen, including any who may aspire to Presidential or Vice Presidential nominations in 1976, that it is no longer possible to take seriously to support again for any office those Congressmen who verbally vocally profess a commitment to peace while voting continued appropriations for war. As its first order of business in the new session, Congress must move to stop this war. We shall do all we can to organize popular pressure on Congressmen to that end.
If the Nuremberg trials mean anything at all, they would hold responsible those officials of the White House, the State Department, the Department of Defense, the C.I.A., and other agencies who continue to prosecute this war. Common morality demands that men and women in these positions resign forthwith.

We who sign this statement will, so far as our responsibilities to others permit, refuse to accept federal employment or appointments, to serve as consultants, advisors, or contractors to the federal government, or in any other ways except at the request of poor peoples' groups to participate in the activities of the federal executive until it has stopped its war-making and war machinery in Southeast Asia. We shall urge this same policy on all institutions of which we are part.
We also shall seriously consider the non-payment of our federal income taxes, and many of us will not pay them, as long as our military intervention in Southeast Asia continues. We shall not, in protest against this war-making, at this time pay the federal excise taxes on our telephone bills; we shall urge the institutions with which we are affiliated similarly to refuse.
Some of us may see the need to commit acts of civil disobedience in witness against this executive lawlessness. All of us will support them in their resolve.

We call upon Congressmen to speak honestly to the American people, and to inform them that it is illusory to expect the release by the North Vietnamese and the Viet Cong of prisoners of war until we stop our military action against them.
We call upon the nation's press to cease being the instrument of the federal executive by allowing its news columns to be filled with self-serving statements put out by undisclosed and therefore non-accountable ""sources.""
We offer to the suffering people of Vietnam our sympathy, knowing full well what a shabby thing that must appear. To democrats and constitutionalists all over the world, we pledge our unrelenting effort to discipline and control American power

It is more than fashionable - and not entirely unprofitable - to be a critic of education today.
Thus one critic charges: ""What the school accomplishes is the alienation of man's ability to act or create his own social being""
Another promises failure: he says ""Every high school student can ....... be virtually certain that he will experience successive defeat at the hands of teachers with minds of chrushing banality.
Paul Goodman asserts ""... it could be said that the schools are as stupefying as they are educative, and compulsory education is often like jail.""
John Halt escalates: ""The only exploiters and destroyers of children today are the schools themselves.""
Charles Silberman mourns: "".... what grim, joyless places most American schools are, and how oppressive and petty are the rules by which ] 2 they are governed, how intellectually barren sterile and aesthetically barren the atmosphere ....""
The plans for vouchers, for community control, for an end to compulsory education, for for ""openess"" all seem, to me, at any rate, to miss the point - the critics on the left believe that schools poor schools make a poor society; change the education system and the system of government changes; actually the reverse is true.
Education is society's tool for its own reinforcement; pressure to change the telescope may not alter the view.

Seven months ago, writing A writer in the July 1971 issue of the magazine Compact, published by the Education Commission of the States, a Colorado attorney offered a description of what the political status of education is in was at the beginning of the seventies this decade.
""There is very little evidence that anyone in public life cares very much about education. Neither leaders nor parents have made it the number one topic. The president last year vetoed education expenditures. ] The administration's SST budget request in fiscal 1971 for $290 million was more than the total, combined requests of 1970 for federal aid to state departments of education, impact aid, and aid to handicapped children.
""Not Senator Edmund Muskie nor Senator George McGovern, nor Senator Birch Bayh, nor Senator Hubert Humphrey, nor Senator Harold
2
Hughes had made this a presidential campaign issue.
""The biggest local issue in Los Angeles, in Denver, in Mississippi, in Charlotte-Mecklenburg, in Oklahoma City is busing and how to keep cultural education from occurring. Wherever education is in issue, it is from the negative standpoint: people against busing, or against sex education, or against student unrest.
""Every politician talks about education. Every candidate, it seems, includes property tax reform, or state aid, or federal aid in his top ten priorities for action. But no one makes education number one. It fits along with housing and health care and welfare reform. As if  ] 4 education were a service, it is lumped in with the privileges of citizenship. In the 1970 campaigns when student unrest was at issue, education was treated by the Vice President as a reward for good conduct ....""
3
""Education ought to be more than a service. It is, after all, the hallmark of any civilization. And it is like the gene which determines future growth. The ideals and inspirations of the student become those of the leader who translates them into social goals. If education is stagnant, so will be the general leadership which it produces.""1
It is precisely leadership which is failing us now: failing us educationally, failing to find a criminal war that never should have been begun, failing to rectify the wrongs done Black and poor people in this country, failing to narrow the gap between those who have and those who do not.
Nearly a year ago Shortly after that, the Congressional Black Caucus, the twelve handful men and one womaen in Washington who shoulder the political hopes and aspirations of Black America - and, one likes to hope, the good wishes of a fair 
4
part of white America - presented President Nixon with a list of requests that would, if answered with any elementary decency and compassion, help solve some of the problems which afflict us all.
Under the topic education, they asked for: 

expansion of child development services 
developmental rather than custodial programming 
5 ] child development services provided as a right 
encouragement of educational innovation and reform 
some consumer control of public education 

To this modest list of rather philosophical requests, they added several legislative suggestions. Those were: 

full funding and full enforcement of the priorities set under Title I of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965;
the abandoning of plans to consolidate federal education

5
legislation into a program of block grants. 

a presidential commtment to universal literacy for every American in this decade; 
greatly increased financial support for predominately Black institutions of higher learning.

None of these are requests was radical, or extraordinary in any way. The President's response was ordinary too, for him, at least. He rejected each proposal and remains to this day callous toward any continuing ] 6 attempts by anyone to improve or enrich the performance of American public education.
It is callous and cruel indeed to treat such requests lightly, when any list is being drawn of the wrongs in public education, its most visible indices are its effects on the most disadvantaged Americans.
Insert A [Handwritten page contains the content to be inserted on the page labeled 6.]
""The NEA itself estimates that as many as 200,000 Black students have been suspended or expelled from schools in the 11 states that made up the old Confederacy in the last 2 years 2""

An Urban Coalition study discovered, for example, that ""dropout rates are much higher for minority group youth than for white youth. For example, 42 percent of Negroes in the 16-21 age group were dropouts in 1968, as compared to only 23 percent among whites of this group.
(insert A)
""Additionally, although the median years of education for Negroes now nearly equals the median for whites, the quality of education afforded ] 7 minority groups is much lower. In his Equality of Educational Opportunity, sociologist James Coleman found that the median score for white children on achievement tests was 9.7 points higher than that of Negro children in grade one, and 11.1 points higher in grade 12.3 The schools, one would could conclude, are widening rather than lessening disparities.""
""In order to change this situation, innovative programs, 
7
expanded funding and institutional reform will be required at all levels from preschool through higher education, including adult education.""4
None of the recommendations of the Black Caucus or of the Urban Coalition are likely to receive a sympathetic hearing in any state house, local school board or in the corridors of the White House unless there is built up in this country a political force powerful enough to make the crisis in and failure of education in America part of the national agenda. ] 8
That is a job for all of us, but particularly for people like yourselves, people who daily see what schools can do, and don't; should do, but won't and people who see what wasted products production line schools can produce.
This crisis is heightened in 1972, the year in which we choose our
[Page handwritten:]
The crisis is heightened by the recent re-election of the most anti-election president since James Buchanan, who vetoed the original Land Grant College Act in 1860.
8
next president, the year in which we can assess the educational performance of the present occupant of the White House.
President Richard Nixon is the worst anti-education president since President James Buchanan, who vetoed the original Land Grand College Act in 1860.
In his inaugural message in January, 1969, President Nixon didn't even mention education.
In his first year in office, his budget included no money for school libraries or textbooks; no money for instructional equipment, for guidance or for testing, less than one sixth of the authorized amount for handicapped children, only one fourth of the authorization for bi-lingual education and only 39% of the monies authorized for educationally deprived children.
In January, 1970, he vetoed, a $4.2 billion dollar appropriation
9
for the Office of Education, and then gave a party for the 191 congressmen who voted to sustain his veto.
That 1970 veto was coincidentally consistent with his earlier actions; in 1960, as vice president and presiding officer of the United States Senate, he cast the tie-breaking vote which tabled a General Aid to Education bill.
In August of 1970, he again vetoed educational appropriations, but this time both the House and Senate overrode his veto. Even today, however, about $30 million dollars of this appropriation are still being held up. In the summer of 1970 President Nixon asked for $75 million dollars for assisting districts with what were called ""desegregation problems"", or just plain inability to obey the law of the land. Investigative work by Senator Walter Mondale's Committee on Equal Education Opportunity demonstrated that these funds were spent in non-deserving or discriminating districts.
10
In September, 1971, President asked the Congress to prohibit the use of federal funds to achieve racial balance. This cynical attempt - just before the opening of the 1971 school year - to play into the hands of the country's worst obstructionists resulted in untold and unnecessary chaos across the country, as white parents opposed to integrated schools became convinced they had a friend in the White House.
In December, 1971, President Nixon vetoed the OEO - Child Development Bill which would have given $2-1/2 billion dollars to begin a system of child day care centers for children from all economic backgrounds, free to the poor, available to others at a sliding scale. The phrasing in his veto message was identical to literature from the John Birch Society which also opposed federally funded day care centers for children.5

What is happening in America today happened once before in American history in the years just after Reconstruction.
Then and now, the national mood will toward progress for Black people faltered and then faded.
Then and now, the liberal white crusaders for social justice and racial equality became tired, and spent their energies on other, non-racial concerns.
Then and now, the progressive movement among black people became ] 12 frustrated, delayed and depressed, not simply by organized barbarity and state sanctioned brutality, but by the forgetfulness of the American conscience and the indifference of the public.
Black people in the Northern cities began to believe that Southern equality was being won, and demanded visible proof in kind in their own backyards
As the movement of Black people spread Northward, it carried with it the school bus, in whose path many a former liberal swayed and was swept away.
The liberal scenario designed for Mississippi would not do in Maine; the romantic view of the south humanistic Southern sharecropper was replaced by the Northern horror of the

The connection between a president and an administration that enforces inequity, inadequacy and racial frustration and fear on an overburdened ] 11 public school system and an administration that has enforced repression, curtailment of constitutional guarantees home and continuation of criminal war abroad benign neglect is simple. The one hand washes the other; the minds which devise preventive detention in the nation's capitol have no sympathy for children detained in overcrowded classrooms in Harlem, in decaying school buildings in Chicago, in the grip of underpaid and overworked teachers, in tiny county school systems too small to adequately provide an educational service.

That has all changed  totally evil or impossibly good. ] 13
All that has changed. This is not the same nation that cheered Martin Luther King at the Lincoln Memorial 10 years ago, or recoiled in horror from police dogs in Birmingham.
A war intervened and drove us apart, creating as much political destruction here as it did physical damage there.
Other movements intruded, and activists dismayed by Black agressiveness could find an outlet in other movements.
Collecting beer cans along the highway became an acceptible substitute for getting jobs for Blacks in the brewery.
That is the problem that has caused the problem of race to remain a problem with no impetus toward solution.

an alternative to buring villages in Vietnam; to make busses in Augusta, ] 14 Georgia, more attractive than bombs into schoolrooms in Laos.
It means doing something which must come as second nature to people who must deal with school boards made up of businessmen and bankers, with legislatures made up of lawyers and farmers, and constituencies made up of angry mothers who want to know not just why Johnny can't read, but why is it he can't read and has to sit next to Roosevelt Jackson Jones too?
In short, you ought to exercise an old American method for redressing your specific and general grievances with those who run things for you in this country and that method is politics.
There are many things we all need. The most obvious are these:
The nation could adopt, and strive for, a policy of full employment.
The war could end tomorrow.

Equal opportunity, both racially and sexually, could stop being the rhetoric of campaigns and platforms and become the reality of the present. ] 15
Through public service employment, increased economic growth, increases in wage minimums and in minimum wage coverage, and in guaranteeing social insurance, radically altering public assistance, every American can be guaranteed an income.
The institution of a national health insurance program and a radical alteration of federal housing programs will additionally aid in making both urban and rural America more attractive places to live, and will ease the desegregation problems of many school districts.
These solutions are achievable in a variety of ways, not the least of which is building a potent, left of center political movement in the United States whose aim is changing the name, and the nature, of the many of the current President of the United States holders of public office.

That election was a national referendum on what has more politely been called ""the social issue.""
As the Reverend Jesse Jackson has put it, the issue ""wasn't the bus; it was us!""

For too many people, an exchange of presidents in this country last November 7th would have meant nothing more than an exchange of photographs on the post office wall; for Black people, ] 16 particularly southern Black people, the issue was whether we progress, run in place, or continue sliding backward as we have been doing since 1968.

The purpose then for which progressively minded people must organize now is to influence the selection, nomination, and election of a new president, vice president, and Congress in 1972.
On one level, the choice for the top office is simple. Anyone besides Richard Nixon will do.
On another, more sophisticated level, the nominee must be someone who delivers reality and not just rhetoric.
It must be someone who will put teeth into the demands for a decent life. 
Since the president took office, we have spent billions

Is it possible to build the new world, where jobs and homes and ] 17 education exist in fact, and not in rhetoric?
It must be possible, and it is. To believe otherwise - as increasing numbers of the American underclass do daily - is to condemn yourself to a short lifetime of dead end streets, to political and economic impotence for which there is no antidote aphrodisiac.

more on war, over two million more Americans have been added to the ranks of the unemployed. 6 million more are on ever-mounting relief rolls, inflation has reduced our standard of living, many American cities face bankruptcy. The racist policies of public and private U.S. Institutions insure that Blacks and other oppressed peoples suffer more than others, in good times and in bad.
(Insert D)
The Vice-President's selection is less important, but must be watched as well.
If you vote for a party because the vice-presidential candidate is Black, or female, or even Jewish, or even someone who who happens to be all three, we will once again have been taken by a token. While the President lives, the Vice President can be anyone. They always do what the President says must be done.
A new Congress will be chosen in 1972 also. These must for the most part be new men and women, not the tired old faces of the past.
16
It must be a Congress that would reject President Nixon's family destruction plan, than would have said no to Lockheed, would have said no to more war, no to the continuation of starving children eating lead for dinner, no to freezes on wages with no freezes on profits, no to Regan Feller Repression in America's concentration camps, no to J. Edgar Hoover's Federal Bureau of Intimidation, no to military millions for twentieth century imperialism, no to Nixonomics and Mitchell's mixups, no to Rehnquist, no to the systematic destruction of Black people, our homes, our few jobs, our children, our very lives.
This seemingly magical transformation can be achieved. The stimulus is there
It is not too soon to begin now. In fact, it is nearly too late. The process is difficult and easy at the same time. It involves involving yourself in politics, my profession, the second oldest profession in the world.
That should be an easy task for people who help run the schools.

Politics is not the art of the possible, as you may have been taught in high school civics, or even the art of the compromise, as you may have learned in Poly Sci 101, but a much more serious art: the art of seeing who gets how much of what from whom. ] 18
We, of course, are the who who haven't gotten any of anything from you know who.
There can be no denying then that the direction Black and poor people and their allies must take in the remainder of the 1970s is toward a real and meaningful participation in a new politics.
That is because it is politics that decides, in the end, what kind of life each of us will have, what kind of world we live in, what kind of futures our children will have.
It is politics that sent our sons and brothers and uncles and fathers to Southeast Asia, to shoot and kill and be killed by other mothers' sons in war not made by politicians them; it is politics that will bring them has brought some back alive.

It is politics that decides that unemployment for Black people will remain at two and three times the national average. And It is politics that decides that we will live in a permanent depression, and it is politics ] 19 that can put money in our pockets and give us jobs or a liveable, not laughable, income now.
It is politics that decides that we must live in second and third hand homes that others have discarded or in vertical prisons of concrete and class designed by some architect who lives in the suburbs. It is politics that made it impossible for so many of us to earn a living back home, and ran us into the to up-South cities to be squeezed together like sardines in a can, and it is politics that will enable us to take over the cities where we live, and turn them into the kinds of places where everyone wants to live and raise their children.
It is politics that gives our children lead poisoning, and it is politics that has created socialism for Lockheed Aircraft and

welfare capitalism for the poor.
It is politics in Southern states that made the man who was principal at Booker T. Washington High School last year the assistant to the ] 20 assistant to the assistant principal at Stonewall Jackson High School this year.
It is politics that made busing acceptable for Black children all over the South until five years ago and unacceptable today.
It is politics which gives tax exemptions to segregation academies.
It is politics that makes us the last to be hired and the first to be fired; that gives our kids twelve years of school, but only six years of education; that has made our young men first in war on the battlefield, last in peace, and seldom in the hearts of our countrymen.

But it's how you play your politics that will be most important not just to you, but to Black people all over this country.
Ask the faces who come before you, seeking your votes in every election ahead, which one is for public housing

in the suburbs, which one is for busing to achieve quality, integrated education, which one is for nationally guaranteed health care, which one is for minimum income maintainance and guaranteed income, which one is for getting out of Vietnam all of Southeast Asia everything and everybody yesterday, which one is for cutting back on defense spending and stopping paying farmers not to farm, which one is for welfare reform, which one stands for you?
You - and the teachers and even some of the children with whom and for whom you work can begin this year to see that the end of education doesn't have to mean the beginning of unemployment.
Those last words are from candidate Nixon four years ago. In 1972 the future, don't let sweet words or pretty phrases blind you.
You know what your needs are, and what the needs are of the children who come to you. You know they are ill served today, despite your best efforts. You know that a change could come, and you must know that you could help bring it.
I wish you well.
