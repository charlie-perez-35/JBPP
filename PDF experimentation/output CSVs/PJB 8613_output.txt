<p>Dear Bob:</p>
<p>How about the following for the "Bond brochure"?</p>
<p>In the world of American politics, Julian Bond is probably better known than any other state legislator in the country. A young, aggressive, outspoken political activist and reformer, Julian Bond is unique among American politicians.</p>
<p>Julian Bond's adult life has been spent in fighting for basic human rights - the right to eat a hamburger or sit in the front of a bus, the right to vote, the right to an open political process, and more recently, the right to be represented by honestly chosen honest men and women. From dusty and sometimes dangerous plantation back roads in Mississippi, to national convention halls in Miami and Chicago, Julian Bond has fought for - and won - important victories for us all.</p>
<p>In the streets, in the courts, at the ballot box or in a legislative committee hearing room, Julian Bond has tried to represent the unrepresented, and to insure that power to the people is more reality than rhetoric.</p>
<p>Bond helped to found the Atlanta Student Movement in 1960 and helped direct massive student demonstrations that integrated public facilities all over that city.</p>
<p>In that same year, he was one of the founders of the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee (SNCC), a youthful band of guerilla fighters against the rigid - and brutally enforced - racial segregation of the rural South.</p>
<p>In 1965, Bond was part of the first group of Blacks elected to the Georgia House of Representatives since Reconstruction, but he was prevented from taking his seat by members of the Georgia House who charged him with treason and sedition, because he opposed the draft and American involvement in Vietnam.

<p>unanimous decision of the United States Supreme Court before he was finally seated in 1967.</p>
<p>In 1968 in Chicago, Bond was nominated for Vice-President, but had to withdraw his name because he was then too young.</p>
<p>Charging that Blacks had been excluded from the 1968 Georgia Delegation, hand picked by then Governor Lester Maddox, Bond became the Co-Chariman of the Georgia Loyal National Democrats, an insurgent group that succeeded in ousting half of the Mad-dox regulars, eliminating the "unit rule" from future Democratic Conventions, and helped usher in the reforms of the '72 con-vention.</p>
<p>A militant reformer, a Black man, a politician - Julian Bond is out to radically change the nature of American politics. He believes that the time to speak is over - the time to act is now.</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>
<p>Julian Bond</p>
