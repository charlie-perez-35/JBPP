<p>Dear Sirs:</p>
<p>Some weeks ago <u>Journal</u> columnist<strike>s</strike> John Crown wrote disparagingly of efforts to repeal the Byrd Amendment, enacted by Congress in 1971 to overide U.S. supported sanctions against the importation of strategic materials from white-minority dominated Rhodesia.</p>
<p>The United States Senate has already voted for repeal: the issue will be voted on by the House in the next few weeks.</p>
<p>The Byrd Amendment has threatened the jobs of American ferrochrome workers, has ma<strike>k</strike>de<strike>s</strike> the United States an international outlaw who supports a racist regime <strike>notzxsxxxixxd</strike> whose legitimacy is not recognized by any country in the world, and endagers our claim to the friendship of the independent Arfican states.</p>
<p>Because Rhodesian chrome and other mater<strike>a</strike>ials are produced by by forced labor denied the right to strike or bargain collectively, it is produced at a rate <strike>below that</strike> too low for American labor to compete with. Already, ferrochrome workers in Ohio and South Carolina <strike>x</strike>have lost their jobs.</p>
<p>The Byrd Amendment does not increase American dependence on chrome from the Soviet Union; the United States Department of Defense has estimated that we have enough chrome ore in stockpile to supply the military for 40 years of war, and Rhodesian chrome imports in 1973 were only 1/2 of of one per cent. Both Secretary of State Henry Kissi<strike>g</strike>nger and Peter N. Flan<strike>a</strike>igan, Assistant to President Nixon for International Economic Affairs, have stated that imports The Byrd Amendment does place us i<strike>m</strike>n violation of of international sanctions imposed by the United Nationsa, and supported originally by <strike>UxxSx</strike> the U.S. of Rhodesian chrome and nickel are not necessary for U.S. security or strategy</p>
<p>In Rhodesia, 5% of the population - the white settlers - rule 95% of the population - the black natives. Prime Minister Ian Smith answered "never" when he was asked when a phased hand-over to majority rule could be beg<strike>i</strike>un. The Rhodesian system of apartheid is matched only by that <strike>the</strike> in South Africa.</p>
<p>Sanctions against the Smith regime may be the last non-violent means of bring-ing the rule of law to that country before the native population decides to follow the example set by America in 1776 and turns toward violence to esta-blish themselves as the rightful rulers of their homeland.</p>
