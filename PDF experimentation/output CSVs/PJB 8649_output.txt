<p>Dear Brothers and Sisters,</p>
<p>This letter. comes at a time when our people are feeling the increasing shock waves of a failing nation. Endless crises reveal themselves, yet, none of them are new to us; for all we know they will confront us with greater intensity and heightened sophistication.</p>
<p>It is imperative, therefore, that we come closer and rid ourselves of any communi-cation gaps. We must build a communications network with unparalled cohesion and direction, and lay the basis for a principled unity which will ultimately forge an untarnished freedom.</p>
<p>It is with this vision in mind that THE BLACK SCHOLAR SPEAKERS BUREAU was founded three years ago. Since that time, the bureau has provided lectures, lecture-demonstrations, cultural presentations, film showings, black studies and black history workshops and seminars to colleges and universities, and professional and community organizations across the country. Literally thousands of black people have been exposed to some fo the most talented and advanced thinkers and activists among this country's celebrated black figures via the speakers bureau.</p>
<p>We at THE BLACK SCHOLAR think you are making a meaningful contribution towards the complete freedom of black people. Our purpose is to do the same. TOGETHER we comprise the first national, all black speakers bureau of real consequence in this country. NOW is the time for u to consolidate our energies resources and increase our activity so that we will grow qualitatively and quantitatively.</p>
