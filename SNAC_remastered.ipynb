He and his family moved to Pennsylvania, where his father, Horace Mann Bond, was appointed president of Lincoln University.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1957, Julian Bond graduated from the George School, a Quaker school in Bucks County, Pennsylvania, and entered Morehouse College. In 1960, Julian Bond was one of several hundred students who helped form the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee (SNCC). In 1965, Julian Bond was elected to the Georgia House of Representatives. He was barred from taking his seat in the House because of his outspoken statements against the Vietnam War. In December 1966 the Supreme Court ruled in his favor and he served four terms as Representative and six terms in the Georgia Senate, from 1975-1986. During the 1968 presidential election, he was the first African American to be nominated for Vice-President of the United States. He withdrew his name from the ballot, however, because he was too young to serve. Later, Julian Bond was host of America's Black Forum. In 1987, Bond narrated the critically acclaimed 1987 PBS series, Eyes on the Prize.\\r\\n\\r\\nJulian Bond continued his tradition of activism as Chairman of the NAACP. He also served as President Emeritus of the Southern Poverty Law Center. Julian Bond was a Distinguished Scholar in Residence at American University in Washington, D.C., and a faculty member in the history department at the University of Virginia.\\r\\n\\r\\nBond passed away on August 15, 2015.\",\n",

He and his family moved to Pennsylvania, where his father, Horace Mann Bond, was appointed president of Lincoln University.<\\/p><p>In 1957, Julian Bond graduated from the George School, a Quaker school in Bucks County, Pennsylvania, and entered Morehouse College. In 1960, Julian Bond was one of several hundred students who helped form the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee (SNCC). In 1965, Julian Bond was elected to the Georgia House of Representatives. He was barred from taking his seat in the House because of his outspoken statements against the Vietnam War. In December 1966 the Supreme Court ruled in his favor and he served four terms as Representative and six terms in the Georgia Senate, from 1975-1986. During the 1968 presidential election, he was the first African American to be nominated for Vice-President of the United States. He withdrew his name from the ballot, however, because he was too young to serve. Later, Julian Bond was host of<span>America's Black Forum<\\/span>. In 1987, Bond narrated the critically acclaimed 1987 PBS series,<span>Eyes on the Prize<\\/span>.<\\/p><p>Julian Bond continued his tradition of activism as Chairman of the NAACP. He also served as President Emeritus of the Southern Poverty Law Center. Julian Bond was a Distinguished Scholar in Residence at American University in Washington, D.C., and a faculty member in the history department at the University of Virginia.<\\/p><p>Bond passed away on August 15, 2015.<\\/p><citation>From The HistoryMakers\\u2122 biography: https:\\/\\/www.thehistorymakers.org\\/biography\\/A2000.008<\\/citation><\\/biogHist>\",\n",

      "                    \"abstract\": \"The official organ of the Communist Party, USA, the Daily Worker's editorial positions reflected the policies of the Communist Party. At the same time the paper also attempted to speak to the broad left-wing community in the United States that included labor, civil rights, and peace activists, with stories covering a wide range of events, organizations and individuals in the United States and around the world. As a daily newspaper, it covered the major stories of the twentieth century. However, the paper always placed an emphasis on radical social movements, social and economic conditions particularly in working class and minority communities, poverty, labor struggles, racial discrimination, right wing extremism with an emphasis on fascist and Nazi movements, and of course the Soviet Union and the world-wide Communist movement. The paper has had a succession of names and has been published in varying frequences between daily to weekly over the course of its existence. In 2010 it ceased print publication and became an electronic, online-only, weekly publication titled the  People's World. The bulk of the collection consists of printed photographic images produced through a variety of processes, collected by the photography editors of the  Daily Worker and its successor newspapers as a means of maintaining an organized collection of images for use in publication. Images of many important people, groups and events associated with the CPUSA and the American Left are present in the collection, as well as images of a wide variety of people, subjects and events not explicitly linked with the CPUSA or Left politics.\",\n",

Philip Randolph, documenting the growth and functions of the union. The Subject File contains a large quantity of material on the growth and functions of the union from 1940 to 1968 and includes agreements reached between the brotherhood and the nation's major railroad lines. Included also is material exchanged between the local unions and the brotherhood's headquarters, as well as files relating to biennial conventions, financial matters, and the ladies auxiliary. There are no records relating to Randolph's creation of the union in 1925 or to the brotherhood's subsequent struggles for existence while organizing various union locals.\\r\\n\\r\\nPart II consists of correspondence and subject files of  brotherhood officials Benjamin F. McLaurin (international field organizer), A. Philip Randolph (founder and president), and Ashley L. Totten  (secretary-treasurer), and other subject files, financial records, and miscellaneous records. The Subject File in Part II contains additional agreements between the brotherhood and the railroad companies, but most of the files concern the participation of the union in railway and labor organizations. The most informative material relating to the organizing activities of the union can be found in the files pertaining to the Brotherhood of Locomotive Firemen and Enginemen. These activities were carried out under the auspices of the Provisional Committee To Organize Colored Locomotive Firemen. The records document the struggles of African-American firemen to retain their jobs and seniority rights with the railroad companies while seeking to be represented by a labor union. Briefs of legal cases brought by the brotherhood on behalf of the African-American firemen are also included in the files. Some of the material in the files relating to Canada also touches on the organizing activities of the brotherhood.\",\n",

Williams Legal Defense Fund, 1971-72 (46 items) which comprise correspondence, petitions, financial records, and press releases concerning the Ann Arbor-based Legal Defense Fund's efforts to raise money in support of Williams's attempts to avoid extradition from Michigan to North Carolina where he had been charged with kidnapping a white couple during a 1961 civil rights confrontation in Monroe, N.C. The correspondence is largely that of. Defense fund coordinator Stephen H. Fleck, and includes letters from representatives of the National Conference of Black Lawyers, the Detroit branch of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, and the Japanese Committee for the Defense of the Life and Fundamental Human Rights of Robert F. Williams.

      "                    \"abstract\": \"The university's earliest , adopted by its Board of Trustees in 1795, defined the duties and rights of the faculty. Formal faculty meetings have been held since at least 1799; the amended adopted by the trustees in December 1799 included guidelines for the conduct of such meetings. Throughout the antebellum period, the faculty was responsible for enforcing social as well as academic regulations and for handling cases of student misconduct. After 1875 the faculty assumed an increasing role in establishing policies governing educational activities and the awarding of degrees by the university. The , originally titled , was adopted by the General Faculty in 1947 and has been amended numerous times. In 1950 the General Faculty authorized the creation of the Faculty Council to act as its legislative body. The council, composed of elected members from the various faculty divisions and ex-officio members from the university administration, held its first meeting on 5 January 1951. Officers of the faculty include the chair and the secretary. The university's chancellor presides over meetings of the Faculty Council. Much of the Faculty Council's work is carried on by its standing and special committees. Laws and Regulations Laws of the University Faculty Code of University Government Faculty Legislation Records include minutes of meetings of the General Faculty, 1799-2011, and of the Faculty Council, 1951-2011; files of the secretary of the faculty and of the chair of the faculty; minutes of the meetings of various faculty divisions; and files of standing and special committees. Beginning in the mid-1990s, there are scattered meeting transcripts among the minutes. There are also recordings of many General Faculty and Faculty Council meetings, 1984-2010, on 283 audiocassettes, 31 data compact discs, and three digital video discs.\",\n",

Coverage includes political, cultural, and economic events, personalities and subjects generally considered valuable for creating a favorable image of the U.S. among foreign audiences.\\r\\n\\r\\nPrincipal ICA staff photographers who contributed to this series include Lawrence J. Riordan, Oliver E. Pfeiffer, Joseph Pinto, George J. Szabo, Jack F. Lartz, Yuki King, Ronald Fett, Lee Battaglia, Barry Fitzgerald, Dwight Somers, Carol Hightower, Ken White and John Wicart. As a result of the sheer volume of picture requests, as well as the variety of locations across the U.S. that were sites for desired photographic coverages, staff contributions were frequently supplemented with work by numerous stringer photographers hired on an assignment-by-assignment basis. Some of the most frequent stringer photographers found in this series include George Knight, James Cayne, Robert Eckman, Suzanne Seed, Chad Slattery, Paul Conklin, Steve Eagle, Jay Leviton, Tommy Thompson, Christopher Springmann, Mel Larson, Brig Cabe, Ed Pierott, Dennis Galloway, Manuel Gomez, Judy Sloan, Randa Bishop, Ken Heinen, Heidi Goldstein, Peter Vaselopulos, Eric Poggenpohl, and Bob Severi. For some assignments, ICA made use of such well-established commercial photo agencies as Black Star, Wide World, Guild Photographers, and Photonetics, or, alternatively, photo-journalists affiliated with such newspapers and magazines as the \\\"Los Angeles Times\\\" and \\\"U.S. News and World Report.\\\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAlong with the photographs generated in the course of an assignment, each file in this series includes a formal or informal ICA assignment sheet, indicating requesting office, coverage purpose, visual strategy and publication intention. In some cases, there also appear notes, from the photographer to ICA Visual Materials\\/Visual Services officials, about the kinds of photographs generated, the atmosphere in which they were taken, and assorted challenges encountered in the process.\",\n",

Elin Elisofon, 1976-1988, nd. Series I forms the bulk of the collection, with most of Elisofon's photography assignments for LIFE magazine represented.  Elisofon's photographs were first published in LIFE in 1937.  He worked for that magazine as an official staff photographer from 1942 to 1964 and then on a contract basis until 1972.  Among his subjects were celebrities, politicians, places, art, architecture, food, and a variety of social topics.  In addition, Elisofon did freelance work and contributed photographs for Time-Life Books and other publications; many of those photographs, as well as photographs taken for personal reasons, are also included in the archive.  Elisofon worked as a still photographer or served in other technical capacities for numerous films, including \\\"Bell, Book and Candle,\\\" \\\"Dr. Dolittle,\\\" \\\"The Greatest Story Ever Told,\\\" \\\"Khartoum,\\\" and \\\"Moulin Rouge.\\\"  He also photographed the filming of \\\"The African Queen.\\\"  Elisofon was involved in the production of the television documentary series \\\"Black African Heritage\\\" and \\\"Africa.\\\"  These and other projects are all represented. Drafts of Elisofon's books include those for \\\"Food Is a Four-Letter Word,\\\" \\\"Color Photography,\\\" \\\"The Nile,\\\" \\\"Java Diary,\\\" and \\\"Erotic Spirituality.\\\"  Materials from his frequent lectures and from exhibitions of his photographs, watercolors, and collection of art and sculpture are also present.  Elisofon served as a founding trustee of the Museum of African Art, and the collection includes records of his donations and bequests to that museum and others.  Recipes and menus gathered by Elisofon comprise Series VII, Food Files.  Among noteworthy correspondents in the collection are editors at LIFE, including Maitland Edey, Wilson Hicks, and Edward Thompson; Joseph Campbell, for whose book \\\"The Art of Indian Asia\\\" Elisofon provided photographs; Warren Robbins of the Museuem of African Art; and Lee Talbot of the Smithsonian.  Elisofon's daughter Elin's files on her father's work and life make up the final series. <\\/abstract>\\n                  <name>\\n                     <namePart>Harry Ransom Humanities Research Center (HRC); University of Texas at Austin<\\/namePart>\\n                     <role>\\n                        <roleTerm valueURI=\\\"http:\\/\\/id.loc.gov\\/vocabulary\\/relators\\/rps\\\">Repository<\\/roleTerm>\\n                     <\\/role>\\n                  <\\/name>\\n               <\\/mods>\\n            <\\/objectXMLWrap>\",\n",

Elin Elisofon, 1976-1988, nd. Series I forms the bulk of the collection, with most of Elisofon's photography assignments for LIFE magazine represented.  Elisofon's photographs were first published in LIFE in 1937.  He worked for that magazine as an official staff photographer from 1942 to 1964 and then on a contract basis until 1972.  Among his subjects were celebrities, politicians, places, art, architecture, food, and a variety of social topics.  In addition, Elisofon did freelance work and contributed photographs for Time-Life Books and other publications; many of those photographs, as well as photographs taken for personal reasons, are also included in the archive.  Elisofon worked as a still photographer or served in other technical capacities for numerous films, including \\\"Bell, Book and Candle,\\\" \\\"Dr. Dolittle,\\\" \\\"The Greatest Story Ever Told,\\\" \\\"Khartoum,\\\" and \\\"Moulin Rouge.\\\"  He also photographed the filming of \\\"The African Queen.\\\"  Elisofon was involved in the production of the television documentary series \\\"Black African Heritage\\\" and \\\"Africa.\\\"  These and other projects are all represented. Drafts of Elisofon's books include those for \\\"Food Is a Four-Letter Word,\\\" \\\"Color Photography,\\\" \\\"The Nile,\\\" \\\"Java Diary,\\\" and \\\"Erotic Spirituality.\\\"  Materials from his frequent lectures and from exhibitions of his photographs, watercolors, and collection of art and sculpture are also present.  Elisofon served as a founding trustee of the Museum of African Art, and the collection includes records of his donations and bequests to that museum and others.  Recipes and menus gathered by Elisofon comprise Series VII, Food Files.  Among noteworthy correspondents in the collection are editors at LIFE, including Maitland Edey, Wilson Hicks, and Edward Thompson; Joseph Campbell, for whose book \\\"The Art of Indian Asia\\\" Elisofon provided photographs; Warren Robbins of the Museuem of African Art; and Lee Talbot of the Smithsonian.  Elisofon's daughter Elin's files on her father's work and life make up the final series. \",\n",

The records constitute investigative case files on persons, organizations, groups, or events believed by the FBI to have the potential to ignite civil unrest that might possibly require the use of Federal troops, such as planned demonstrations and protest marches. Many of the records encompass surveillance of groups considered \\\"agitator\\\" organizations, such as various civil rights- and socialist-oriented groups that formed in the 1960s, many of which were specifically targeted by FBI Director J. Edgar Hoover for suspected Communist influence. Some material further pertains to investigations of political organizations and groups that formed on college campuses in the 1960s.\",\n",

They reflect his involvement with many aspects of the government\\u2019s activities relating to civil rights. They consist of correspondence, memorandums, drafts of bills and executive orders, published and unpublished reports, newspaper and journal articles, and other types of material. Among the topics represented in the files are implementation of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, consolidation of federal efforts in the field of civil rights, businessmen and civil rights, the military and civil rights, discrimination in medical facilities, ethnic minorities, public accommodations, discrimination in housing, the Voting Rights Act of 1965, federal assistance programs, desegregation in the South, public and vocational education, law enforcement and riots in northern and southern cities, and violence directed against blacks in the South. Although the series includes material on civil rights throughout the United States, many of the documents focus on the South, particularly Alabama, Mississippi, and Florida. There is considerable material on the United States Commission on Civil Rights, the President\\u2019s Committee on Equal Employment Opportunity, the Community Relations Service, and the 1966 White House Conference on Civil Rights (\\u201cTo Fulfill These Rights\\u201d).\",\n",

Field Division of the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI). The records constitute investigative case files on persons, organizations, groups, or events believed by the FBI to have the potential to ignite civil unrest that might possibly require the use of Federal troops, such as planned demonstrations and protest marches. Many of the records encompass surveillance of groups considered \\\"agitator\\\" organizations, such as various civil rights- and socialist-oriented groups that formed in the 1960s, many of which were specifically targeted by FBI Director J. Edgar Hoover for suspected Communist influence. Some material further pertains to investigations of political organizations and groups that formed on college campuses in the 1960s.\",\n",

Philip Randolph, documenting the growth and functions of the union. The Subject File contains a large quantity of material on the growth and functions of the union from 1940 to 1968 and includes agreements reached between the brotherhood and the nation's major railroad lines. Included also is material exchanged between the local unions and the brotherhood's headquarters, as well as files relating to biennial conventions, financial matters, and the ladies auxiliary. There are no records relating to Randolph's creation of the union in 1925 or to the brotherhood's subsequent struggles for existence while organizing various union locals.\\r\\n\\r\\nPart II consists of correspondence and subject files of  brotherhood officials Benjamin F. McLaurin (international field organizer), A. Philip Randolph (founder and president), and Ashley L. Totten  (secretary-treasurer), and other subject files, financial records, and miscellaneous records. The Subject File in Part II contains additional agreements between the brotherhood and the railroad companies, but most of the files concern the participation of the union in railway and labor organizations. The most informative material relating to the organizing activities of the union can be found in the files pertaining to the Brotherhood of Locomotive Firemen and Enginemen. These activities were carried out under the auspices of the Provisional Committee To Organize Colored Locomotive Firemen. The records document the struggles of African-American firemen to retain their jobs and seniority rights with the railroad companies while seeking to be represented by a labor union. Briefs of legal cases brought by the brotherhood on behalf of the African-American firemen are also included in the files. Some of the material in the files relating to Canada also touches on the organizing activities of the brotherhood.\",\n",

    "So, 8 missing birth dates, 57 missing death dates (presumably many being people who have not yet died), 48 with no bio and 25 with no corresponding VIAF link. Oh an dmost of them are missing gender info on SNAC, but I don't think that's a huge deal. All in all, seems successful. Going to export with everything included for now, but may need to trim things down. Not sure how useful the gender column will be. Happy with the output though."
