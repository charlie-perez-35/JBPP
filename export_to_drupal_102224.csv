PJB 1574,"<p>February 7, 1968</p><p>Mr. T. J. Curry<br/>President<br/>Westside Voters League<br/>968 Lena Street, N. W.<br/>Atlanta, Georgia</p><p>Dear Mr. Curry:</p><p>We were surprised to learn from reading Sunday's edition of the <u>Atlanta Daily World</u> that we have been invited to attend a meeting of the Westside Voter's League on Thursday, February 8th. Neither of us has received an invitation and it is a surprise to learn of the meeting and our invitation through a newspaper. We hope, however, that if our measure is discussed in your meeting that your deliberations will not be guided by the misinformation contained in an editorial in Sunday's <u>Atlanta Daily World</u>.</p><p>The editorial mistakenly states that our bill deals with the Board of Education; it does not.</p><p>The editorial mistakenly says that our bill would lead to corrupt politics; it would not.</p><p>The editorial mistakenly says that our bill would make it difficult for Negroes to exercise restraint over the Board of Aldermen; this is not so.</p><p>The editorial states that we should contact leaders of the Negro community before proceeding further with our bill; we have done so, and until Sunday's <u>Atlanta Daily World</u> appeared, we received unanimous support for this bill from the Negro community.</p>                       <p>-2-</p><p>Under our bill, the Negro community will exercise the same control as it does today over eight members of the Board of Aldermen and the President of the Board, all of whom will continue to be elected city-wide.</p><p>What our bill will do is to provide that half of the members of the board will be elected by voters in the wards from which they qualify.</p><p>This would mean that Negro voters in the 3rd, 4th, 7th, 1st and 6th wards could elect a Negro alderman, and that voters in every ward could be assured that their alderman would be responsible to them. Presently, there are members of the Board of Aldermen serving today who lost in their wards, but were elected by voters in other wards in the city.</p><p>Finally, there are enough Negro voters in all but two of the wards to insure that any candidate, white or Negro, elected ward-wide or city-wide, could be elected without having to appeal to Negro voters.</p><p>The Board of Education elections referred to are covered in another bill, introduced by Rep. John Hood.</p><p>Sincerely,</p><p>Rep. Ben Brown of the 135th District</p><p>Rep. Julian Bond of the 136th District</p><p>BB:JB:lcm</p><p>Thanks to FromThePage transcription contributors: TeeTwoThree Carlos Perez</p>"
PJB 1426,"<p>November 6, 1967</p><p>Mrs. Helen Howard<br/>558 Magnolia Street<br/>Atlanta, Georgia</p><p>Dear Mrs. Howard:</p><p>Just a quick note to say that I am still working on the idea for the Information Center I mentioned before. The idea is nearly the same as the one Mrs. Paschal had a year or so ago; as I said, she was never able to get any money for it. I am trying to find enough money to:</p><p>open up two center in Atlanta,<br/>hire two full-time people (neighborhood residents)<br/>for each center, and<br/>keep each one going for at least two years.</p><p>The clinic you have would be an ideal place for one of these, since you are well known in that community and people come there for other services already. I would hope that if these centers did get started, people who used them would see the need for other action as well, like political action aimed at getting better representation on all levels. The centers--if they worked correctly--would bring people to a place where you would talk to them about other forms of activity while you helped solve some of their problems.</p><p>Incidentally, did you ever think of asking the National Medical Association, the national association of Negro doctors, for help with your clinic? They might be able to supply some money, and so could the Medical Committee for Human Rights, a national organization that has sent doctors and nurses South to give free medical advice to poor people and people in the movement. I could contact both groups if you would let me know what you need.</p><p>At any rate I'll keep in touch.</p><p>Sincerely,</p><p>Julian Bond</p><p>Thanks to FromThePage transcription contributors: TeeTwoThree Carlos Perez</p>"

PJB 1663,"<p>Julian Bond<br/>Representative, District 136<br/>162 Eurahlee Street, S.W.<br/>Atlanta, Georgia 30314</p><p>Committees</p><p>EDUCATION<br/>Transportation<br/>INSURANCE<br/>Surety &amp; Title<br/>STATE INSTITUTIONS &amp; PROPERTY</p><p>[State of Georgia seal]</p><p>The House of Representatives<br/>Atlanta, Georgia<br/>March 22, 1968</p><p>Dear Friends:</p><p>This is another issue of my newsletter. We hope this will give you some idea of what I have been doing, and that you will try to let me know what you want done. If you know others in your neighborhood who would like to receive this newsletter, please send me their names and addresses.</p><p>* * * * * * *</p><p>We are still concerned about city services - street paving, garbage collection, street lights - and so on. If you have any complaints in this direction, please let me know.</p><p>* * * * * * *</p><p>I have asked Governor Maddox to veto a very bad bill the legislature passed this year. This bill will let the state of Georgia sue to collect money paid to people on welfare after they die. In other words, if someone has been on welfare for 10 years and buys a small house, when he dies, the state will be able to sue to get the house to sell it. I think this is one of the worse things the legislature has ever done, and I hope the Governor will veto the bill.</p><p>Also, I am concerned about the Atlanta Housing Authority. As you may know, the Negro legislators tried to make some changes in the Housing Authority, but could not. They have been holding secret meetings--a policy which I feel is not appropriate for public organizations. After five months of delay, however, the Authority has agreed to an ""open door"", first-come-first-serve policy in housing project admissions.</p><p>* * * * * * *</p>                       <p>Now that the legislative session is over, I want to give you some idea of what the legislature did and what bills I supported and which ones I tried to defeat.</p><p>All of us, of course, were vitally interested in passing House Bill 1592 that would have split the 3rd Ward and could have provided our community with two new Negro aldermen and a Negro member of the Board of Education. The city aldermen fought this bill and ex-Mayor Hartsfield managed to persuade some of the Fulton County Senators not to support it. It failed by one vote in the Senate.</p><p>I was also disappointed that my bill, House Bill 1616 (introduced with Rep. Ben Brown) to require that half of the aldermen run from their wards instead of city-wide was defeated. The city fought this bill, too. If it had passed, Negroes in five of the city's wards could have elected Negro aldermen.</p><p>I supported House Bill 1587 to increase the powers of the Mayor, which was also defeated; I supported House Bill 1079 to outlaw discrimination in state employment; House Bill 1095 to abolish capital punishment in Georgia; House Bill 1644 which would have made it illegal to discriminate in selling or renting homes; two bills which would have provided tenure for teachers in Atlanta and the rest of the state; and Senate Bill 248 to enlarge the Atlanta Housing Authority and require that one member live in public housing.</p><p>In addition I worked to support House Bill 912 to make it illegal for a policeman to physically injure anyone when it is unnecessary; House Bill 861 to increase workmen's compensation and House Bill 926 to increase unemployment compensation; a bill that increases the number of days before a tenant can be evicted; a bill to require that all seventh grade students have tests for contagious diseases; a bill to provide equal pay for equal jobs performed by men and women; a bill to require that election officials post a large sign outside polling places; a bill to allow dispossessed tenants to have their furniture placed in storage; a bill requiring that a minimum wage of $1.60 be paid to all workers; a bill to allow the Fulton County Board of Elections to print sample ballots; and some others. Sadly, the best of these bills did not pass. I hope next year we will have better luck.</p><p>* * * * * * *</p><p>Part of our difficulty this time was that some legislators did not wish to cooperate with us, and that the city fought us on one or two bills. Hopefully, through increased voter registration, we will be able to bring about some changes during the legislative races this summer and fall and the city elections in 1969.</p><p>Sincerely,<br/>[signed] Julian Bond<br/>Julian Bond</p><p>Thanks to FromThePage transcription contributors: TeeTwoThree Carlos Perez</p>"

I have begun to think about the establishment of a journal of political affairs in the South with particular interest in poverty and race. The publication would be monthly and would feature a review of governmental acts--city, county and state--in each of the Southern states, insofar as acts of governments had some relationship to racial affairs.</p><p>We would not, for instance, be interested in the action of the legislature of Mississippi raising the price of fishing licenses or even in their promoting a new authority to handle the sale of bonds for some industrial development, unless of course, we could show that the license fee discriminated against Negroes and that the leading members of the authority were members of the Citizens Council.</p><p>Each issue would try to detail some aspect of the Southern governmental, political scene. For example, two issues this past summer would have dealt with the Negro candidacies in Mississippi; why some succeeded and others failed as well as a discussion of prospects for the future.</p><p>I have been wondering about what prospects there were for succeeding with such a venture and whether you had any suggestions for its operation.

Funds appropriated have not all been released to local schools and to colleges -- about 30 million still held up -- along with funds for pollution control, other social purposes.</p><p>In the summer of 1970 President asked for funds (75 million) for assisting districts with ""desegregation problems.""  Later investigation by Sen. Mondale's Committee on Equal Educational Opportunity indicates these funds were channelled, in open disregard of HEW staff recommendations, to non deserving districts -- in some cases without even an application from the district.  This was a forerunner to the Presiden'ts so-called desgregation bill.</p><p>September 1971 -- As a verison of a bill to provide $1.5 billion over a 2 year period to help desegregating school districts was moving through the House the President, following the Charlotte-Mechlenbur<s>y</s> <sup>g</sup> decision asked the Congress to specifically prohibit the use of federal funds to achieve racial balance.  This came shortly before school opened in 1971 and caused great turmoil, set integration back drastically -- made school districts in an intenable position.  The Congress did add the anti-busing amendments to the bill in December 1971.</p>                       <p>-2-</p><p>In December 1971 the President vetoed the OEO -- Child Development bill which would have authorized $2.5 billion to begin a system of child day care centers (with health and education emphasis) for children from all economic strata, free to the poor, available to others at a sliding scale fee.  The reasons for the veto were identical, even to phrasing, of John Birch literature opposing the program as inimical to the structure of the family (!)</p><p>See also attached excerpts relative to school lunch controversy in the fall of 1971.</p><p>Nixon also openly promised aid to parochial schools, but has never mentioned plight of public schools until State of Union speech on January 20, 1972.</p><p>The President's Wage-Price Board also refused to allow teachers to receive pay as provided in contracts agreed to before August 14, the date of the wage price freeze.  Not until Congress passed Phase II and ordered teachers to be paid, despite administration objections did the issues begin to be resovled.  Even so, the Wage Board delayed implementing the retro-active pay until well into the beginning of the New Year.</p><p>MG/mb</p><p>[seal]</p>                       <p>[image left top margin]<br/>Washington Memo ON FEDERAL EDUCATION PROGRAMS<br/>NEA OFFICE OF LEGISLATION AND FEDERAL RELATIONS / 1201 16th Street, N.W. / Washington, D.C. 20036</p><p><u>Lost: $1.1 Billion for Schools</u><br/>February 2, 1970</p><p>THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES VETOED THE EDUCATION MONEY BILL AND THEN THREW A PARTY FOR THE 191 CONGRESSMEN WHO SUPPORTED HIM</p><p>On January 28 the White House held a reception for 191 Members of the House of Representataives who had just voted against adequate funding of federal education programs.

The record voe (see p.3) was 226 against it, 191 for it.  Voting against Mr. Nixon were 100 Deomcrats and 27 Republicians.  The vote to sustain the veto included 35 Democrats and 156 Republicans.

The Nixon budget asked <u>no</u> money for school libraries or textbooks; <u>no</u> money for instructional equipment, guidance, and testing; only 15% of the <u>authorized </u> amount for handicapped children, 25% of  authorization for bilingual education; and 39% of authorization for the educationly deprived children.</p><p><u>In 1970 President Nixon</u> vetoed $1.1 billion in increased funds for education voted by Congress.</p><p>""Wild Crazy Inflationary Kids!"" [lower left margin with comic picture of kids holding sign saying PLEASE HELP OUR SCHOOLS]<br/>@1970 Hechlock<br/><u>Copyright 1970 by Hechlock in the Washington Post </u></p>                       <p><u>EFFECTS OF THE NIXON VETO</u></p><p>The maintenance of existing programs will require increased local property taxation if Congress accepts the Fiscal 1970  budget, according to studies by the NEA.  We have been informed that schools may be forced to close in such big cities as Dallas and San Diego.  In addition, six districts involving some 35,000 pupils in Ohio will definitely not open in September because of a lack of federal impact aid funds.  Further, several districts will be affected by closing drastically curtailed education programs in Oklahoma.</p><p>Commenting on the Nixon veto, NEA President George D. Fischer declared: ""This mone bill was betoed...by a cynical and ill-advised Predident....We must put first things first.  The Federal Government should be providing on-third of the money required to operate our schools.  Instead, its share of school funding has actually dropped over the past two years, from eight per cent to 6.6 per cent.""</p><p><u>FALLACIES OF THE NIXON VETO</u></p><p>In his veto message to Congress, President Nixon offered three basic arguments which collapse in the face of logic and economic good sense.</p><p><u>1. It`s inflationary.</u> To Mr. Nixon, the addition of $1.1 billion to the education budget would be inflationary.  He told Congress and the Nation that education costs more today, and that adding more federal funds would fan the flames of inflation.  Morever, deficit spending in the Sixties caused a price rise of 25%.</p><p><u>Answer:</u> The President doesn't tell us that the increase for education represents only one-half of one per cent of the <u>total</u> federal budget -- a figure that could hardly be called inflationary.  More inportantly, investment in youth is actually counter-inflationary.  Well educated citizens get good jobs and pay taxes far in excess, over a lifetime, than the moeny invested in their education.  The under-educated become the unemployed and under-employed in our soceity, absorbing rather than paying taxes.  The 'deficit spending' argument ignores the fact that during the Sixties family income nationally rose and average of 54% (in some areas it rose as much as 74%)</p><p><u>2. The programs are wrong.</u>  The President declared that the added funds are for ""low priority"" programs, federal programs whose value is in doubt.</p><p><u>Answer:</u> Lower priority, perhaps in the view of the Executive, but not necessarily in the view of Congress.  The bill vetoed by the President provided substantial increases for programs which Congress, teachers, and supporters of education considered vital to the national interest: programs for the educationally deprived; supplementary education services and centers; school library resources; guidance, counseling, and testing; programs to upgrade teacher skill; development and expansion of vocational education; higher education facilities; and library services.</p><p><u>3. The timing is wrong.</u>  The President argued that because of the lateness in the fiscal year, ""increases of this magnitude cannot be used effectively in many cases.""</p><p><u>Answer:</u>. The President has had the power to use funds for the puroses and in the magnitude of H.R. 13111 since October 31,1969.  This power was contained in a continuing resolution to which Mr. Nixon gave his approval.  Moreoever, school districts planned 1969/70 programs on the basis of the appropriation passed by the House last July.  Commitments must be met, and any surplus resulting from the late funding could be carried over to Fiscal 1971.</p><p>And a good measure of blame for the late appropriation must be shared by the Administration, which was late in proposing a budge, and which did not testify on the appropiration until October.  </p>                       <p>Follwing is the record vote on the President's Veto of H. R. 13111, the Fiscal 1970 appropriation for the Departments of Labor and Health, Educaton, and Welfare. A Yea vote favored overriding the Nixon Veto; a Nay vote was to sustain the President's position.</p><p>January 28, 1970    CONGRESSIONAL RECORD - HOUSE    H 457</p><p>[three colums]<br/>[first column]<br/>The SPEAKER.

Where no exisiting authority can handle the problem, the advocate agency could contract with an outside person or agency. Senate Committee sources say the advocate program is intended to stimulate development of services where there are none, and also prevent the growth of unnecessary ones. Twenty pilot agencies are authorized in the bill. The House is currently drafting its own version of the child development bill. Child care provisions are also included in the Administration`s welfare reform bill (HR 1), but these services are open only to children of working mothers or those enrolled in work training.</s></p><p><s><u>USOE ASKS RECALL OF ""MISSPENT"" FUNDS</u></s></p><p><s>The U. S. Office of Education (USOE) will recall $25 to $30 million in ""misspent"" education funds, U. S. Commissioner of Education Sidney P. Marland announced recently. Initial audits by the Department of Health, Education, and Welfare revealed that six states and the District of Columbia have misused $5.5 million in compensatory education funds paid between 1965 and 1969. The money, allocated under Title I of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act, was used by the states instead of --rather than in addition to-- state and local funds. In the District of Columbia, for example, $1 million in Title I funds were used as general aid to buy equipment and books. In Detroit, $77,000 was used to remodel a church which was not used for Title I teaching. Civil rights groups have frequently charged that Title I has not been used to provide additional services to the poor. The Commissioner said the abuse was the result of honest mistakes, addng ""we have found no error in terms of fraud, dishonesty or bad faith."" Marland estimated that the repayment from all 50 states might total as much as $30 million.</s></p><p>August 15, 1971<br/><u>CONTROVERSY ERUPTS OVER SCHOOL LUNCH FUNDING</u></p><p>Proposed regulations putting a ceiling on federal spending for the school lunch program have evoked charges that 2 million needy children will go hungry this year. State school lunch directors have denounced U. S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) guidelines issued August 13 which reapportion $615.2 million in fiscal 1972 funds to states serving lunch. The effect of this ruling is to reimburse some states at a higher rate than last year, but reduce the reimbursement rate to others. The lunch administrators say this will force schools which have counted on the money to curtail their programs or pick up the extra cost themselves. Since the regulations came out just weeks before the opening of school, with money already allocated and many state legislatures adjourned, many states will be unable to provide the money even if they can afford it. State school lunch directors say that the USDA regulations, if implemented, would bring the lunch program to a ""screeching halt.""</p><p>Congressional critics also charge that the regulations ""blatantly violate both the letter and spirit"" of the law passed last year guaranteeing a free or reduced-price meal to all nation's needy children. Many states greatly expanded their school lunch programs to the poor on the promise that Congress would provide the necessary funds. The effect of the proposed regulations, Senator George McGovern (D-S.D.) says, is to negate that promise. McGovern, chairman of the Senate Select Committee on Nutrition and Human Needs, says the new guidelines assure all states an average reimbursement rate of 35 [symbol: cents] for a free and reduced price lunch, not the 60 [symbol: cents] guaranteed by Congress. Withour a commitment that the federal government will provide sufficient funds, states are unwilling to expand their programs to feed the 2 million needy children who went hungry last year, McGovern concluded. Assistant Secretary of Agriculture Richard Lyng denied charges that the Department was cutting back funds, but admitted more money would be needed to feed all hungry children. The Agriculture Department requested the same amount of money for 1972 to feed 9 million needy children as it did in 1971 when it served 7.3 million poor youngsters. </p>                       <p><s>last spring, stoped repainting old schools, put its maintenance crews on a four-day week, and still finished the year with a $20 million deficit. The Philadelphia Superintendent called on the federal government to nationalize the funding and operation of the nation`s 25 largest urban public school systems. Shedd estimated the cost would be $10 to $20 billion, a ""modest sum"" compared to the infinitely greater amount it would take to rebuild the nation`s urban centers.</s></p><p><s>HOUSE REJECTS STRONG CIVIL RIGHTS BILL</s></p><p><s>The House has rejected a strong civil rights bill designed to help end job discrimination against teachers and other public employees. By a close 202-197 vote September 16, the House defeated a measure which would have given strong enforcement powers to the federal fair employment agency, the Equal Employment Opportunities Commission (EEOC). The bill would have given the EEOC power to issue legally enforceable ""cease and desist orders"" against employers discriminating on the basis of agency`s jurisdiction to include teachers and other public employees. Instead, the Representatives approved a substitute measure, sponsored by Rep. John Erlenborn (R-Ill.), which only allows the Commission to bring court suits in discrimination cases, court action, and forbids class action suits in which one individual files on behalf they may now. The NEA strongly supported the original EEOC bill, and is working to be taken up by Congress in the near future.</s></p><p><sup>Sept, 1971</sup><br/>[The following underlining is added in pen, and the paragraph is marked with a left marginal bracket.]<br/><u>CONGRESS</u> MOVES TO RESCUE <u>SCHOOL LUNCH PROGRAM</u><br/>Congress is moving swiftly to insure that every needy child will receive a free or reduced price lunch this year.

The topic will be ""Dissent in a Free Society."" As student co-ordinator for the 1969 Public Affairs Symposium, I would like to invite you to participate in this Symposium on Wednesday, February 12, 1969. I am authorized to offer you an honorarium of $500 plus expenses for this time. During this time you would be involved in symposia, classes, and student discussions, and on Wednesday evening you would speak and participate in a panel discussion with the Reverend William Sloan Coffin and Senator John Tower.</p><p>As you perhaps know, Dickinson College is one of the oldest and most distinguished liberal arts colleges in America. There is a lively and intellectually alert student body of 1500 undergraduates, a young dynamic faculty, and a progressive administration. Our Public Affairs Symposium is presented each year by a joint student-faculty committee in an effort to confront the college community with various aspects of a vital public issue. There is also wide participation by students from the Dickinson School of Law and the Army War College. In previous symposia we have discussed:  THE AMERICAN PURPOSE IN WORLD REVOLUTION, URBANIZATION AND THE AMERICAN SOCIETY, THE NEW MORALITY, THE POWER OF PERSUASION, and THE EYE THAT NEVER BLINKS (television).</p><p>In next year's Symposium we will be using several media of expression in an attempt to bring about a complete understanding of dissent in its history and various ramifications. Thus far in our planning, we have arranged for Phil Ochs to appear in concert, and there will be student productions of ""Protest"" drama on the weekend prior to the Symposium. We are also arranging for Mr. Ben Shahn to bring an exhibition of his poster art to the campus. The more academic aspect of the Symposium will begin with Mr. Michael Harrington analyzing the dissent of the past decade.</p>                       <p>2</p><p>For the entire week each of the major departments in the College will have on campus an authority who will relate the topic to the specific disciplines. The Symposium will end on Thursday with a major address by a historian who will tie together the dissent of the past with its future in our troubled times.</p><p>The topic of dissent has taken on more pressing importance in the recent weeks than it had when we chose it for the 1969 Symposium. A challenge too big to be ignored has been hurled at the complacency of America. This challenge we hope to be able--with your help--to answer in the Symposium. We hope to force our college community and all who come in contact with us not only to become concerned about our ""Free Society,"" but also to commit themselves to complete realization of that term.</p><p>Sincerely yours,<br/>[signed] Charles J.

The present executive, elected last year on an activist platform, is trying to democratise both the structure and values of university government, introduce educational reforms and concurrently develop a level of social consciousness and involvement within the university community.</p><p>One of the proposed experiments towards these ends is a year long integrated speakers program, open to both the university and public, and featuring people from a variety of contemporary backgrounds.</p><p>Your election to the Georgia legislature and subsequent ejection due to your views on Vietnam, and your involvement in the 'new politics' movement has prominently placed you among the small but articulate group of dissenting Americans. Consequently we would like to invite you to McGill to discuss with the university community topics such as:  (1) the chances of a new radical political consensus coalescing in America, its aims and chances for success (i.e. potential effectiveness); (2) the role of the university community in such a coalition. Of course these are only suggestions; any ideas on your part would be most welcome.</p><p>Due to the experimental nature of the program, we would rather not stipulate a definite format. However, we're considering the following:  first the speaker articulates his views on the topic(s) he has selected; later a previously prepared group of students and professors either subjects the speaker to a 'hot seat' question period or presents an alternative view of the issue. The speaker can defend himself, after which the audience will criticize any of the previously expressed opinions and hopefully offer their own ideas. The goal is to help create an active rather than passive audience making the term 'speaker' anachronistic.</p><p>We feel that a stayover of two days, each encompassing a lecture at lunchtime and a 'hot' session at night, would be sufficient to generate among those interested a reaction to both the subject and speaker. Due to the</p>                       <p>- 2 -</p><p><u>Mr. Julian Bond</u></p><p><u>September 1, 1967</u></p><p>arrangement of academic lectures there are generally more students at the university on Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday than on Monday or Friday; in particular it would be preferable if you were here during the period November 14 - 16, or alternately November 7 - 9.

For instance, I <strike>migh</strike> could talk on the firsy day of the immediate past and present status of the American civil rights struggle and on the second of its prospects for the future. In doing so, I don't just consider that movement involving the equality of American Negroes, but a complete setting right of the whole American social order.</p><p>At any rate, I think we can get together through the mail on topics and I hope to hear from you shortly. I am looking forward to being in Montreal again.</p><p>Sincerely,</p><p>Thanks to FromThePage transcription contributors: TeeTwoThree Carlos Perez</p>"
