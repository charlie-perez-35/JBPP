I hope that through this newsletter you will know what I am doing and you will begin to let me know how you want me to serve you. We got many responses from the last newsletter, and I hope that each one of you will send me the name and address of someone in the 136th District you think would like to receive future issues.</p><p>******</p><p>With this issue of the newsletter, I hope to include more information that will help you help me make decisions about how all our lives will be. If you like the newsletter, or if there is something you would like to see in future issues, please let me know.</p><p>******</p><p>I am pleased to report that Governor Maddox did veto the welfare bill I mentioned in the last newsletter. You may remember that this bill would have let the State of Georgia sue to collect money from the children and heirs of welfare recipients after their deaths. This would have meant that if a person on welfare had managed to save a few pennies and buy a home or some furniture, the state could have taken these things away. I asked Maddox to kill this bill and he did. It was one of the few nice things he has done since he became Governor. Incidentally, the Republicans in the House said this bill was the one they were proudest of. We should remember that during this year's elections.</p>                       <p>[First box:  image]:  illustration of buildings surrounded by smoke in the background on the right side of the picture.

Text above the box reads:  ""WE'RE to Blame for the Riots?! . . . Why, I've Never Been in a Ghetto in My Life!""</p><p>[Second box]:  Text inside the box reads ""Race prejudice has shaped our history decisively; it now threatens to affect our future.""</p><p>The comment above is from the Commission that investigated last year's riots in America's big cities. The cartoon explains the attitude of too many people about doing something for America's poor people. I hope that Dr. King's death will finally begin to make people realize that changes must come quickly before the entire country explodes. We can be thankful that Atlanta was quiet during the dark days after Dr. King was killed.</p><p>******</p><p>Some of you may know of an elderly person who wants a job.

You can register easily at the Fulton County Court House. You may know someone who cannot read and is ashamed to admit it. Even people who cannot read can vote, so encourage your friends and neighbors to go down and register.</p><p>******</p><p>My wife has presented me with a 6 pound, 15 ounce baby boy on April 12.

At the top of the colored piece of paper I have enclosed in this newsletter is a street map that shown how the new line will run South of Lena Street to a station near Ashby and Lena Streets just below Mayson Turner Avenue. From the station, the line will run almost underground under Mayson Turner, under Taliaferro Street, under Leach Street, under Raymond Street and under Chestnut Street and Griffin Street until it gets to Sunset Avenue where it will be level with the street on up past Electric Avenue. I say ""almost underground"" because it will be in what is called a ""cut"", a small valley which will help cut down the small amount of noise the system vill make. Those of you who live in this neighborhood may want to attend a public hearing on the Rapid Transit routes and station locations either at the West Side YMCA on May 16th or at the AME Zion Church on Hightower Road on May 22. At either of these meetings you will have a chance to make any objections or suggestions you have about the line.</p><p>******</p>                       <p><u>Page 4</u></p><p>******</p><p>If any of you want to make a contribution to the Martin Luther King Memorial Fund, to honor Dr. King's memory and to support the work of the organization he headed, Mrs. King and Rev.

PJB 1748,"<p>June 3, 1968</p><p>Professor Gerald A. McWorter<br/>Afro-American Studies Center<br/>Fisk University<br/>Nashville, Tennessee</p><p>Dear Gerry:</p><p>Thanks for the letter. I've been to two black students' conferences lately, one at Shaw in Raleigh and one at the University of Connecticut.</p><p>Both bothered me; the one at Shaw was overly structured by the President, Dr. Cheek I believe his name is, and the one at Connecticut was too filled with mystique.</p><p>As a beginning, I would suggest you contact Miss Juanita Clark at the Metropolitan Applied Research Center in New York. Last summer, Miss Clark (no relation to Dr. Kenneth Clark)(was working toward a New York area conference of black student groups, and appeared to have extensive contacts throughout the country.</p><p>Secondly, I would think you might want to make a definite distinction between those groups that are</p><p>(more)</p>                       <p>Professor Gerald A. McWorter<br/>June 3, 1968<br/>Page two</p><p>oriented toward blackness as a basis for study and introspection and those which want to engage in positive action, community work and/or campus reform.</p><p>My limited experience has been that groups which fit into the former category are next to useless and spend most of their time listening to Malcolm X tapes and Aretha Franklin records. Groups in the latter category are in the minority, but need, I believe, to be cultivated.</p><p>The Shaw conference suffered because most students in attendance seemed to come from groups that those described last above; secondly, there was a hint in the air that the president wanted to establish a new, non-violent campus-based SNCC, controlled by Shaw students.</p><p>Although it may sound like the typical liberal-radical response, I believe that these groups need more than anything else a medium of communication. A group in Nashville needs to know that a group in Atlanta...or even Oakland...is working on a similar program. There needs to be some mechanism for spreading important information amongg these groups so that special projects can be agreed upon. Such organizations as SNCC, CORE, the National Black Anti-War, Anti-Draft Union need to have a way to feed their information into these groups.</p><p>Had these groups <strike>g</strike>been in contact with each other through a periodic, regular newsletter, for instance, I would have wanted to use that media to recruit student workers for the candidacy of Attorney George Payton in Charleston and for other black candidates who need the sort of help from the black college community that Kennedy and McCarthy have been getting from the white college community.</p><p>The newsletter could have been used to let people know about the articles you organized on the black university in <u>Negro Digest</u>, and for a host of other, informative purposes.</p><p>(more)</p>                       <p>Professor Gerald A. McWorter<br/>June 3, 1968<br/>Page three</p><p>In other words, I believe these groups need to be infused with a sense of action; study has its place, but some of the groups I've observed have become study groups alone. Their meetings degenerate into shouting matches wherein each member tries to display the greatest m<strike>a</strike>ilitancy and hatred for white people.</p><p>That may have its place too, but not in an era when young people have deserted the activism they displayed in 1963, '64 and '65, and not in an era when the black community needs, more perhaps than ever before, dedicated young organizers and articulators of its problems.</p><p>Black students served that role in older movements. They could serve it in a newer one, if they are encouraged, organized, and if they can get off the campus and into the streets.</p><p>Please keep in touch on this. I want to hear more.</p><p>Sincerely,</p><p>Julian Bond</p><p>JB:nb</p><p>Thanks to FromThePage transcription contributors: TeeTwoThree Carlos Perez</p>"

Because the Challenge Committee would not like any major address to come before the Tuesday noon date, I suggest that you plan to arrive in Salt Lake on Monday afternoon, April 1, and leave on Thursday morning, April 4.  That will give us two full days.</p><p>In addition to the major address at the U. of Utah, you are wanted at Westminster College and by a group at Brigham Young University.  The same address could be used for all three times, because it would be different audiences.  Westminster would be on Wednesday morning, and BYU probably on Tuesday evening.  In addition, we definitely would you to meet informally with our SOUL group (this might be a mixed group with a Free U. class on Negro History.)  Then there would probably be a couple of classroom situations of an informal nature, not needing a set speech.</p><p>We hope you can undertake this schedule.  We'll try not to fill it so full you can't enjoy the trip.  It is fine for you to stay all three nights at the hotel arranged by the Challenge Committee.</p><p>As for money, we have about $75 in sight beyond the Challenge Committee allotment.  That would mean about $25 or $30 for the extra expenses and about $45 or $50 extra for you.  Will that be enough for the extra day?</p><p>We'll go ahead hoping and planning this way, but hope to hear again soon.</p><p>Sincerely,</p><p>(signed) Grover Thompson</p><p>GROVER THOMPSON</p><p>President, SOUL</p><p>w</p>                       <p>(Peggy:  Please send a carbon copy of this letter to the person from the University of Utah whose <strike>name</strike> letter is the most recent in my file - I can't recall his name)</p><p><sup>√ Merrill Cook)</sup></p><p><sup>√</sup>Dear Mr. Thompson:</p><p>Thank you for your letter.</p><p>The arrangements you have mentioned are fine with me.

One of the major items on the agenda for that meeting is a discussion of the developing separatist movement in the United States. Our concern here is what some people see growing out of the ""Black Power"" advocacy as far a growing interest and emphasis on the part of a large number of black people and some whites that blacks be allowed to determine their own destiny even if it means existing in separate communities, economically, politically, socially, etc.</p><p>I have been asked to invite you to be one of the four panelists on the evening of February 1, to participate in a discussion of what might be called, ""The Separatist Movement and the Civil Rights Struggle"". The other panelists are Paul Anthony of the Southern Regional Council and Chuck Morgan of the Southern Regional Office of the American Civil Liberties Union, as well as Cleveland Sellers whose commitment I have not yet been able to secure.</p><p>My assumption in having suggested your name is that you would be very likely take the position nearer to that of Mr. Sellers and somewhat in opposition to that of Mr. Morgan and Mr. Anthony, which I hope is what you would do. I think that there needs to be a clear and articulate expression of some of the sincere feelings on the part of the black people in this country relative to their future and their place in the development of this nation, and from some of the things I have heard from you myself, I feel that you are one of the most articulate persons at this point.</p><p>We would appreciate it very much if we could have your reply at your earliest convenience; I am <br/>Sincerely yours,<br/>J.

PJB 1778,"<p>ALBION COLLEGE<br/>ALBION, MICHIGAN</p><p>May 6, 1968</p><p>Dear Mr. Bond:</p><p>Ventures In Meaning Week at Albion College takes the form of exploring an issue of current and religious significance, through the contributions of persons knowledgeable about the subject matter through personal involvement.</p><p>Among the topics explored recently have been ""The New Morality,"" ""The Death of God Theology,"" ""psychiatry and Religion,"" ""Ferment on Campus.""</p><p>The VIM student-faculty committee for next year has decided on the theme of ""Soul Week '69."" The intent of this venture is to explore the meaning of black consciousness as a positive and dynamic force giving shape to our American society.</p><p>There are those who believe that the concept of soul is a commercial put on, thinking we are being pulled into a great hoax through this exploration.  Further, we have had on campus recently persons like Bayard Rustin, Leroi Jones, John Hope Franklin, Floyd McKissick, the late Martin Luther King, Jr., etc. In this respect, some feel we have over exploited this theme with our 1750 whites and 24 blacks.</p><p>It is in this light that we have chosen to come at the theme of Soul Week and black consciousness from the perspective of religion. It has been agreed that this will not be another occasion in which black people will flagellate white people by providing them with another verbal beating to make them feel good or angry or hostile.</p><p>What we propose to do in this week is to discover the meaning and value of Soul and black consciousness. The way we seek to do this is through the role religion plays in this new reality that we believe to be as creative as it is tension producing.</p><p>For the most part, we will be asking creative blacks to express themselves through their own medium thereby demonstrating the religious dimensions, or lack thereof, vis-a-vis soul and black consciousness. It is the case that we are forced to</p><p>ACTION PROGRAM FOR EXCELLENCE  APEX PROGRAM</p>                       <p>Mr. Bond     -2-     May 6, 1968</p><p>operate on a very limited budget, and within this to try and explore the theme of VIM '69 with the help of a black poet, dramatist, novelist, painter, sculptor, dancer, as well as through a service of worship and cinema.</p><p>In this regard, we are very anxious to engage you for our Soul Week '69. We are going to have a panel, hopefully composed of yourself and two other persons, who will help us to understand the meaning and value of Soul Week and its religious and non-religious dimensions. The date we have in mind is Tuesday, February 25, 1969. This would take place in the evening. The expectation being that you and two other panelists would speak for 15 or 20 minutes apiece, question each other for 15 or 20 minutes, and then receive questions from the floor for an hour.  Our hope is that you would find what we are trying to do a contribution to our College and community, and that you would shape your remarks to this particular setting.</p><p>It might be helpful to know that Albion College is located 90 miles West of Detroit. The city of Albion is composed of the same constituents which make up any large urban city, indeed, Albion is called a ""little Detroit."" Twenty-five percent of the 14,000 plus inhabitants are black, there are poor whites, mexicans, etc., we share in this community with the other dominant forces. At this juncture, some forces for creativity have begun to move into the city and in the college.</p><p>So, we expect, out of this kind of a venture, education through understanding what it means to be black and how this is authentically expressed through creative persons, including yourself.</p><p>For this contribution the College would provide you with an agreed upon honorarium and honor your travel and other expenses.

Young, <i>Executive Director</i></p><p>January 30, 1968</p><p>Dear Mr. Bond:</p><p>There is a need at this critical point in the history of our movement for publication that will take it upon itself to put the most advanced views of the Afro-American writer, artist,  photographer, minister, and politician, as well as other progressive thinkers, before the American people.</p><p>SCLC is prepared to publish such a paper twice monthly.</p><p>The newspaper would be an SCLC organ whose most urgent purpose would be to promote the Washington campaign, documenting the conditions of poor black people in this country and their struggle to come to grips with the poverty and proximate affluence in the society. The long-range purpose is twofold: to provide a continuing SCLC organ and to fill the need for interpretation and analysis of social, economic and political problems in the ghetto.</p><p>But we can not do it without the guidance and cooperation of the best minds available. That is why we are asking you to join us in this venture as a member of our advisory board.</p><p>As you know, several newspapers which have become, in the past, means of cultural expression among Negroes, were the brainchildren of civil rights organizations. The <u>Crisis</u> was an NAACP organ, The <u>Messenger</u> was a Pullman Porters Union newspaper and <u>Opportunity</u> was begun in the Department of Research and Investigation of the National Urban League.</p><p>It is appropriate that today SCLC build a paper that will make available to students, writers and other interested persons dependable data on Negroes and serve as a means of cultural expression as well as the voice of a growing, active movement.</p><p>The assumption so fatal to the contemporary Negro press that whites and Negroes are cut form the same pattern will be substituted with the proposition that all men have equal rights no matter their differences.</p><p>In order to overcome inequalities, we must first be able to recognize that they exist. Our paper, (intially an eight page offset tabloid style paper), will do just that.</p><p>The first several issues of the paper, for example, will be primarily devoted to creating an understanding of the poverty that has created the need for an SCLC jobs or income campaign in Washington, D.C.</p>                       <p>We would hardly expect you to be able to find time to deal with some of the sticky details confronting the staff of the paper, but would hope that you would find time to give us some general instruction about policy and format.</p><p>Your point of view will be greatly appreciated for here in the SCLC office at the moment we are suffering from a myopia which has forced us to deal mostly with problems of naming the paper, circulation techniques, financing it, board structure, contacting, writers, photographers, artists, and illustrators.</p><p>Please let us know if you would be interested in joining the advisory board of the paper. Board members would have access to the pages of the paper, and their suggestions solicited and heeded in many policy matters as well as technical areas.</p><p>We would also like to know if you would be able to submit articles, editorials, or materials to be printed, either your own writing or suggested work of others.</p><p>Thank you.</p><p>William Mahoney, Managing Editor<br/>[signed William Mahoney]</p>                       <p>Dear Mr. Mahoney:</p><p>I would be delighted to join the advisory board of SCLC's new newspaper.</p><p>I hope you will feel free to call upon me at any time I may be of service.</p><p>I am looking forward to receiving your first issue.</p><p>Sincerely</p><p>Thanks to FromThePage transcription contributors: Carlos Perez Privacylover esh999</p>"
